Jun 25




Today we're going to use Zone Analysis on the 15 Minute Chart.  As you can see, we've had two candles enter the Pink Zone.  History tells us we'll need to have at least one candle blast through the Brown Zone for a triple digit finish.  On the other hand, if we see the  SMI Ergodic Indicator  tighten up, the Brown Zone will be almost impossible to penetrate leaving us with a sideways or downward pattern.  We understand most people think Zone Analysis is unreliable, possibly even a little fishy, but we only use the original Formulas and Zones as intended by the original inventors.  Today we're calling for a definite move up, or down (or sideways).

Today we're going to use Zone Analysis on the 15 Minute Chart.  As you can see, we've had two candles enter the Pink Zone.  History tells us we'll need to have at least one candle blast through the Brown Zone for a triple digit finish.  On the other hand, if we see the  SMI Ergodic Indicator  tighten up, the Brown Zone will be almost impossible to penetrate leaving us with a sideways or downward pattern.  We understand most people think Zone Analysis is unreliable, possibly even a little fishy, but we only use the original Formulas and Zones as intended by the original inventors.  Today we're calling for a definite move up, or down (or sideways).

Today Litecoin has reached the  support level  at $72. This is the 361.8%  Fibonacci retracement  level that has been rejected cleanly. At the same time price has reached the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel , and overall it seems like it could reverse to the upside. 

Nevertheless, there are no confirmations of this happening right away and LTC/USD still could decline lower. It is important to watch the current price action in general and the $72 support in particular. 

If the support will be broken, with the daily close below, price should decline further towards 427.2% Fibs at $57, that also corresponds to the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel . But, if the support will hold, trend reversal could be the case, and price is likely to start moving higher, at least towards the 50% Fibs resistance at $128

If the support will be broken, with the daily close below, price should decline further towards 427.2% Fibs at $57, that also corresponds to the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel . But, if the support will hold, trend reversal could be the case, and price is likely to start moving higher, at least towards the 50% Fibs resistance at $128

As you can see, Litecoin is just mere dollars away from breaking below closest critical support; after that, it will be a free-fall to around $50 area, followed by another massive crash that will send it to sub $30 territory. 

Litecoin is a scam; the rise last year was manipulated and anyone who bought it above $100; rest assured, you will never ever make your money back. This is what you get for listening to scammers/ponzi scheme promoters. Litecoin has no real world use and might get delisted from Coinbase. 

Remember, the creator of Litecoin actually advised against buying it and sold all his coins at the top! 

During the last bear market, LTC performed worst of all coins and crashed 97% from its  ATH 0.25% . If the same scenario happens again, which so far looks like it does, this will send LTC to $9.70, which I believe is still way too much for this joke coin.

As you can see, Litecoin is just mere dollars away from breaking below closest critical support; after that, it will be a free-fall to around $50 area, followed by another massive crash that will send it to sub $30 territory. 

Litecoin is a scam; the rise last year was manipulated and anyone who bought it above $100; rest assured, you will never ever make your money back. This is what you get for listening to scammers/ponzi scheme promoters. Litecoin has no real world use and might get delisted from Coinbase. 

Remember, the creator of Litecoin actually advised against buying it and sold all his coins at the top! 

During the last bear market, LTC performed worst of all coins and crashed 97% from its  ATH 0.25% . If the same scenario happens again, which so far looks like it does, this will send LTC to $9.70, which I believe is still way too much for this joke coin.

LTC is approaching a key  support level  which intersects with the current downtrend line that it has been retesting as support since may. 

RSI  is completely bottomed out which does suggest the current price trend is running out of strength however in this market that is not a valid reason to go long. 

I will be keeping an eye out to see how LTC will react when the horizontal support meets the diagonal  trend line . My guess would be a sharp decline in price followed by a bounce and we should start to see some upwards price action. 

Ive also drawn some previous support / resistance levels at the sub $70 USD mark.

LTC is approaching a key  support level  which intersects with the current downtrend line that it has been retesting as support since may. 

RSI  is completely bottomed out which does suggest the current price trend is running out of strength however in this market that is not a valid reason to go long. 

I will be keeping an eye out to see how LTC will react when the horizontal support meets the diagonal  trend line . My guess would be a sharp decline in price followed by a bounce and we should start to see some upwards price action. 

Ive also drawn some previous support / resistance levels at the sub $70 USD mark.

The economist called the  Bitcoin              phenomenon “generation and geographic”. Shiller discussed how Silicon Valley is more enthusiastic than the East Coast and that impressive cryptographic theory has emerged from computer scientists. However, Shiller mentioned how  Bitcoin              could be extinct in 100 years because of hard forks.

On the 2 day chart,  LTCUSD 6.48%  has the look of wanting to turn back to the north.  Basing this on the  support and resistance  that are showing on the 2 week chart.  Watch the  CCI  and consider why you like this investment:  because you can track with leverage,to buy low and hold, to use for spending on purchases, to buy low and sell high...  LTCUSD 6.48%  will most definitely reach back towards $175 after it bottoms.  Waiting until $63 for 1/4 of cryptocurrency entry, if goes to $50, then ALL IN BABY!!!  well I only invest a little bit in crypto right now ;)  Wish I could short and use leverage US!

If you compare the March-April correction you can see we are forming a very similar structure for the reversal.  We have  RSI  and  MACD bullish divergence  building over the past week or so and it looks like the sellers are getting exhausted.  Always a chance for another push to test lower, but I don't see any reason it would go below 65 and it may already have found bottom at 73.  Refer to the March 31-April 2 chart for where we are now in the process.  Remember - bottom is a process, not a specific number.  The predicted continuation of the  Elliot  impulse aligns well with the resistance points/fibs already established, so it should be pretty predictable for the next few moves.

So  LTCUSD -2.98%  appears to be in the B-wave of an ABC-correction after it's first wave downwards of the last wave 5 of a higher degree. We completed a clean impulse wave up from $75 to a little over $80 as a wave A, and are now in a corrective B-wave inside a corrective wave 2. At least, that's what it looks like at the moment. Trading corrections is tricky enough as it is, but trading a correction in a correction is definitely a moment to stay out of the market as far as I'm concerned. 

For the time being, I'm happy to let this B-wave unfold and see what it ends up like. After that, we'll have one more move upwards I think to the area of $82,50 - $85 before we go into the third wave of wave 5 on a higher degree which should get interesting and full of trading opportunities. Remember, the trend is your friend, and you trade corrections at your own risk. The present B-wave could unfold into a variety of shapes, after all. 

Time to sit on my hands and wait!

2. There will be a rollback in the zone of 94-113 $ (and if buyers are very trying there is a chance to test the  trend line  in the price zone of 120-130 $)

1530204525,Jack777,"LTC in equilibrium, break coming!","
Hey guys, LTC just like big brother  BTC              is right now in a tightening range on the 4H with 81,8 as resistance & 77,8 as support. A break here is coming rather sooner than later, and will see a big move. Of course, the direction will highly depend on big brother  BTC             .  

A bear break is looking at 73,3 at least. Should those not hold, next supports in the Daily are at 70 & 65 respectively. A bull break could lead at least to the recent highs at 84,5.  

=> Since we're in a  bearish trend  , the break of equilibriums always favors the bears, than it does the bulls. But you still have to wait for a clear break,  esp             . with those long wicks & fake-outs. So always be more conservative, miss a few percent rather than getting faked out.

1530206822,Forex_Academy,"LTC, symmetrical triangle pattern","
Litecoin price has lost -0.74% in the last 24H and we can see here in this 1-H chart how a symmetrical  triangle pattern  is formed with the price still stuck in the central  pivot point  around $79.20, very close to test the resistance and ready to make another move to the support.The 50  EMA  is also following the price as a dynamic resistance and the 100  SMA  keeps below the 200  EMA , technically speaking this means that the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse. My expectation is that a stronger selling pressure is coming and LTC/USD would probably break the support line of this triangle as well.

1530213190,MAGICMARK,LTC ... more down to go?,"
A few months ago someone told me LTC could hit $55.  I looked at them like they had just landed from another planet and where talking out of their hands. 

Today, I sit here shaking my head at this coin. 

I'll admit I used to be an AVID supporter of LTC.  I was a holder ... but this coin has cost me dearly. 

I denied any wrong doing in respect to Charlie selling all his LTC at the absolute peak. 
I gave them grace when litepay launch was delayed. 
Then the bad news came ... litepay was nothing more than hot air, and it evaporated in front of our eyes. 

Since then, this coin has struggled. 

I will say, LTC has always been a slow mover ... slow up, slow down ... but there's a magic point above around $225/$230, where it jumps to $270 maybe $300. We are far from that point, really far.  The slow down part helped when  BTC -0.78%  was dropping, it served as a good coin to hold, IF you were holding ... didn't erode as fast ... but then that changed when litepay vanished. 

I will give LTC another thing ... if I want to transfer crypto, I always convert to LTC. It's fast and cheap to transfer LTC. 

But here's the TA ... this coin is toying with what I would say is the last string before it can drop significantly.  There's a low established in Nov 2017 at 74 and another at 71 ... we hit 75 the other day. Dangerously close. Then it drops almost in increments of $10.  That's how we get to $55.   
A  BTC -0.78%  drop to between $5000 - $5400 will likely put enough sell pressure on to do that to LTC.   

Scary ... poor coin. I'll sit back and watch. There's just too much downside, and the prospect of a slow recovery. I do hope better for LTC holders. I really do... 

Remember only a fool relies on one potential outcome.

We expect Litecoin recovery to begins from one of our two demand zones. Bounce zones are around $80 and $50 

Litecoin is an amazing project and coin altogether. With that said we would go in for safer buy after solid uptrend above resistance line. 

Short investors can short it while everyone else can give it a nice hold.

1530234513,awgal,Venturi Yin & Yang Effect - Litecoin,"
Venturi Effect = The Venturi effect is the reduction in fluid pressure that results when a fluid flows through a constricted section of pipe which causes a stronger pressure out flow.  

So as the price starts decreasing and constricting with shorts going crazy, and longs getting rekt... we wont need new money to move this market anymore. The current amount of shorts, longs and fundings that are being used and parked, is still here. Remember trading is just moving money/crypto from one person to another. Someone is still buying and accumulating, someone is still lending their coins, and someone is still longing. This market isn't dead, we are just in a cycle correction, after this cycle we enter a  bullish  new cycle, and that is when new money comes in.

In last review we wrote about Litecoin's downward slide. Since that time, it has continued. The was a little update of the minimum. But it was getting lower and lower steadily. On the chart for almost 6 months we see a gradual decline after the previous rise. This semiannual story looks like giant snow cap sliding down a high mountain under its own weight. The farther away, the greater is the mass of accumulated snow. And the higher is the risk of avalanche in case of strong shock. In order to avoid unpredictable and destructive avalanche in the mountains usually it is caused artificially. The same story in on the market: bears make sharp meltdowns after which rise usually starts. But now there are no meltdowns. Cryptocurrency cap has been growing. The dander of avalanches.

The rate of Litecoin flies into the abyss. 
Priority of the day: LTCUSD -0.70%  rate depreciation to $ 67. 
The bear trend for Litecoin dragged on, there was no good correction upwards, so we do not plan to support its sales today. For us, the  earnings  on bounce of Litecoin rate are more likely than on the continuation of its fall. Therefore, today we are waiting for the best situation. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  LTCUSD -0.70%  will decrease from $ 73 to $ 67. 
2. The rate of  LTCUSD -0.70%  will take the lateral movement. 
Alternative scenario: 
At the moment, the market is ruled by bears, but we are counting on an alternative plan - the purchase of Litecoin. But before that, we need to see the initiative from buyers of Litecoin, so we expect a bounce of its rate to $ 80. And then, we plan to earn on the growth of Litecoin rate.

1530268246,cheynos,We need good news ASAP. The bigger picture+ my next move (LTC)  ,"
Hello everyone 

Today I’m back with some more ideas, let's get straight into this.  
So the  bearish trend  is clearly not over yet. What are the most important things to look at +  my orders.  

Graph 
So what is this graph telling us?  
We can see that there is a strong support-line at 51 USD. That is our next stop if you ask me. Why? 
- the  volume  is ridiculously low and is not going up since may.  
- there is no good news or rumours about any collaboration anymore.  
- this graph looks terrifying if you zoom out.  

I think that everything below 51 USD is a bargain for LTC. The only question now is: when is this bear market going to end? Now it's time to thicken your wallet or to hodl. We are now in a bear market since January. There will be a moment that the bears will go down (when the big players are not shorting crypto's anymore).  

My prediction 
I think that LTC will go down to +/- 51 USD and will find support at that level. Everything after that will depend on the  volume . 
If  volume  stays like this we will never go above our first resistance-line, let alone our second resistance.  

my orders 
I will be patient at this one, I will set an order on 50 USD. I can't imagine that LTC will never go above 50 USD anymore in the future.  

News 
We don't see any rumours or good news anymore if it comes to LTC. In the past there were rumours of collaborations with  FB 0.51% , Alibaba, Amazon, Uber and so on. We need good news and some rumours again  ASAP             . Don't get it twisted, I'm still very  bullish  for crypto in general, despite the fact that I'm convinced that this  bearish trend  will continue for a couple of weeks maybe months. This game is a  marathon 4.36% , not a  sprint 0.09% . 

We have a great product in blockchain-tech. The only problem is that there isn't a problem in the financial space. We've found a solution, now we've got to search for the problem.

LTC/USD has lost altitude in the last hours and it has failed to resume the  bullish  momentum towards the sliding line (sl1). The perspective remains  bearish  despite the aggressive rally as the rate is trapped below several very strong dynamic resistance levels.

#LTC is trading inside a  wedge  , Yesterday, Bulls broke out of the  wedge  which is a buying signal as long as #LTC can close on a daily candle above 82$. The  bullish trend  will face $90 as a heavy resistance where the red line lies. I would suggest to sell a bit sooner and wait for a daily candle closes above the red line. This will target $109-$115 and then $129 levels. The  pivot point  protects $130 levels. The bulls have defended $75 levels aggressively so far. A daily candle closes below the  wedge  means the bears have broken below $75. TA wise, this pattern targets $60. We have to wait for a clear confirmation of which direction #LTC will decide to move. Therefore, I suggest traders wait for a daily candle close above $82, or a bit higher at $85 before buying the crypto currency.

A well defined bearchannel is haunting this market. The  RSI  indicator has jumped out of oversold territory again which could be a hint that a countermove may be seen but what bulls really need is to break the string of lower highs and lows. 

The top end of the bearchannel is seen at 92 while 87 sees the  Bollinger Bands  midline. This area stands for the first resistance band. Above that a stonger ceiling between 103/110, previous support, is the next stop. One can say that a move above 110 is needed for technicals to improve in this crypto. 

It seems likely to see a test toward these levels short-term. 72 and 67 serve as support on dips.

The price is moving inside of the  Falling Wedge  pattern which is considered as a reversal pattern. Possible reversal is supported by  Bullish Divergence  which can be spotted on the chart when the price and  RSI  are not following each other but moving opposite directions. Upside potential is maximal while downside potential is minimal - what it means that as the market is starting slowly recover and if it does establish a solid rock bottom here it means upside potential is greater than downside.  

The market is not out of the woods yet and that's why it's important to wait for confirmed signals before opening a new entry. 

The price needs to break out above of $86.7 - $93 levels to signal any bullishness and offers good entry point. Once it manages to break above of the confluence zone and if  volume  starts expanding, then this gives good confirmation for upward movement and that the price is trying to push higher. The measured pattern target is at $131 level and partial profit target is at $105 - $111 that can be found close to the next  resistance level . 

Trading Information: 
Buy: Above $86.7 - $93 
Partial Profit Target: $105 - $111 
Main Profit Target: Around $131

If this correction is not done, this is the road down to the $40 area,I personally dont think its over but time will tell, all the fib extensions measure out perfectly here, the Wave 3 Extension is right on the 161.8%. That tells me we have a wave 5 to finish the 3 to the larger degree(green box) and then 5 (yellow box). But if this is an  ABC , we just have to finish the 5th and will end somewhere in the green box, which should complete the correction for now, either way I think we have at least one more leg down

1530655546,BethanyJoy,LTC fails at pivot point,"
So far LTC has found a strong rejection at 50% of the potential 1.618 fib extension of the move from 72.50 to 84.50 (88.27), after rallying to the complete potential target of the bullflag breakout. 

In alignment with the  BTC -0.55%  idea I published earlier today, I think we're going to complete the H&S-ish pattern outlined here in black, and revisit 81-82. A close over 88.5 would scramble this idea. A close over 90 would likely send us to 92, then 93.50 and then 96.

Litecoin is starting to consolidate around the $83.50 level in early Thursday trading, after multiple technical rejections from the key $85  resistance area . 

The intraday sentiment towards the  LTCUSD -0.73%  pair is starting to turn  bearish , after price created a  bearish  double-top pattern. 

Sellers will now try to break the $81  support level , while buyers will look to move price above the $85  resistance level  once again. 

The  LTCUSD -0.73%  pair is only intraday  bullish  while trading above the $85 level, further upside towards the $87 and $88 levels remains possible. 

If the  LTCUSD -0.73%  pair moves below the $81 level, price may start to move back towards the $79.70 and $77 support levels.

Looking at the chart, the middle kelt has acted as resistance the last few days. Long wicks above the kelt, but closes below. Today looks like another close below with a test of the lower kelt looking imminent.  If you zoom out to the weekly, LTC has dropped below the lower kelt, and that is now acting as resistance. I intend to scale in with a successful hold of the lower kelt, roughly $76, or I will go long if we close above the middle kelt on the daily, and will increase my position with a close above the lower kelt on the weekly. For confirmation I will be looking for a higher low on the  RSI  & OBV. The crypto markets may be due for a run, however nothing has really indicated that the  bearish  sentiment is over, and it could be more sideways action below $100 for LTC.

1530836209,HodlCrypot,LTC/USD SPOTTED QUADRUPLE ALGO TARGET AT 65 USD,"
Dear HodlCrypots,  

Currently there is some indecision in the market. The spike up of  btc 0.07%  entered a no trade zone (at least for me).  

While I was updating my chart for LTC I noticed a sweet algo target that had four (!) algo targets set between 64 and 66 usd. Either this is a huge coincedence or it must be an important  pivot  in the chart where going long is a nice trade.  

In the case of the wave count we notice that the last wave of 5 is still a possibility in my primary count.  

When we look at the  volume  we notice that there is a horizontal line at the buy zone and an increasing pattern in the sell zone.  

We also (and ofcourse this is preliminary) notice that the  rsi  showed a moment of weakness in the  daily chart  when an important resistance line was reached. In the case of a (follow up of)  bullish divergence  on the  rsi  in the 4h chart this would mean a lower low and where our  elliot  count will be probably completed at the  pivot  where our algo targets are.  

Furthermore the  MACD  4C is still in the red which means it might not be over yet, which increases the chances of hitting the algo targets. This ofcourse is completely dependant on the movement of  btc 0.07% .  

It's just an idea and when this idea actualy takes form expect a nice bounce from it because it will be an extremely technical play.  

Thanks for taking your time to read this!  

Stay safe and good luck everyone!

1530914465,DahcNotsgnivil,LTC crazy comparison to BTC,"
Hello crypto enthusiasts and traders, it has been a while since my last post where the  three drives  pattern failed as LTC was beaten down below the long term  trend line . Still Long on LTC for 2018 as this is not unusual for the crypto market and afterall,  BTC -0.46%  was ranked the worst investment in 2014 and people are starting to say the same thing now about 2018 so let the next part of history also repeat itself - more on that here https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/17/why-bitcoin-is-the-worst-investment-2014 . Anyhow, we've had quite a few weeks to accumulate more LTC and average down at prices many getting into LTC in late 2017 have never experienced. Lets keep it simple with this chart. 

Being curious, I overlayed  Bitcoins -0.46%  % line over Litecoins and have found a pretty cool oscillating pattern between the two. The chart says all you need to know but lets be clear, BTC's line is roughly where LTC would be $110-$130 so this is not saying we are mooning, but more so saying that based on previous history, we SHOULD check in to the  BTC -0.46%  % line. Only if  BTC -0.46%  also rises, would LTC be able have crazy % gains as seen Q4 2017. Happy trading!  

Please like this post to see more analysis and breakdown in the upcoming crucial days. 

This is not financial or trading advice and trades should not be made based on this chart or anything I've written. These are just merely my opinions.

The rate of Litecoin rose sharply above the $ 83 level. 
Priority of the day:  LTCUSD -1.44%  rate increase to $ 88. 
Sellers could not lower the price of Litecoin, and the fight was won by buyers. The potential for growth in the price of Litecoin is small, because there has not yet been a good movement downwards for the market reversal.  
Projected scenarios:

2. The  LTCUSD -1.44%  rate may be in flat all day. 
Alternative scenario: 
Too many rollbacks to the momentum of the rise in the price of Litecoin - the first sign of the weakness of buyers. Therefore, at any time we expect the fall of Litecoin to $ 76. Today this plan is unlikely to happen, but it is still possible.

					This could be a possible scenario. The scenario only describes how we get there. People always need pictures to be able to imagine things. But we all invest money, most of us but without taking a close look at the fundamentals. 

Only if you have rated an investment, then it is worth making a chart. Therefore, the evaluation of an investment is strongly related to the technical analysis and the potential.
