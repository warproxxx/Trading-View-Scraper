Another great trade produced by our indicators! A short alert was sent to everyone who has the indicators settings set up like we do and this short trade is currently profitable 2.74%! For those of you using 5x and 10x leverage (as I know some of you are), this is gains of 13-27% within less than 24 hours! That is incredible so congratulations to you guys. Great job!

All you need is the three indicators below and you can start getting all of the exact same long and short signals as us, as well as the stop loss line that can constantly be updated to lock in profits as these trades mature. It's an absolute blast and I'm so happy they have helped so many of you guys.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.13% , in order to stay relatively strong. 

If you find my analysis helpful, please like & subscribe, and watch my daily videos! ;) (description in my status)

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC -0.05% , in order to stay relatively strong.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC -0.06% , in order to stay relatively strong. 

If you find my analysis helpful, please like & subscribe, and watch my daily videos! ;) (description in my status)  

About myself: Global citizen & early  Bitcoin -0.06%  adopter from Germany. I invested in the 2nd rally from 50 to 1.000 Dollars in  BTC -0.06%

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.06%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.06%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Looking for a 4 hour lower high and tightening range for the next couple days.  
Note ETH pulled back the hardest of the 3 ( BTC 0.52% , ETH, LTC) and therefore has the most ground to make up.  
LTC was also hit hard last night but the morning bounce has much more strength than ETH does.  
Still work watching for the weekly higher low to form if the bulls can break a tightening daily range in their favor to try and shift the momentum. 
Continuing to make the bulls prove it to us with  volume  and follow through.  
4 hour  EMA  resistance and if bulls get over it, daily  EMA  resistance will be right there waiting.

And so, the market continues downward movement, it is too early to talk about the global market rotation 
Now we observe the activity of buyers on the upper border of the large consolidation 
But, from the fact that after the initial rebound of the price, the strength of buyers was not enough for the rapid development of the upward movement,  
we conclude that they do not have enough strength. 
Yes, the price may remain in the consolidation now, and if it accumulates a significant  volume , the price may go up, but now we see the continuation of a downward trend

THE ETHICAL CODE OF THIS POST....  

This is NOT about discrediting 'HONEST' Tradingview members. 
It is a 'HOW TO' and cautionary advisement, some topics may be unpleasant.  
Draw your own conclusions, supplement with your own research. 
If you appreciate the work, add a LIKE. 
Feedback is welcome... if helpful, on topic and NOT antagonist. 
Several TOP AUTHORS commended this work and now follow. 
If you participate in the chat area, you are also flattering the work. 
Finally, this is a HUGE project in progress... be patient. 
May have to recopy/post a few times before it gets a permanent home. 

When I was new to Tradingview... 

I was severely overwhelmed, somewhat lost. 
Took months to figure out what was going on, who to trust, what to do first. 

You probably viewed my POST because... 
- you are eager to learn.. and if possible, only from the best  
- you want profitable trades, most of the time, enough to make a living  
- you want all this... NOW ::LOL::  

My goal is to help you avoid the mistakes I made when I was new.  
Anyone can provide great direction, but you still have to do the work. 

 -- LET's BEGIN with the MOST IMPORTANT RULE of TRADING -- 

     ***Trading is BOTH Psychology and Methodology*** 

- The 'state of mind' of the trader is everything in cyrpto trading 
- but methodology is what improves your odds of making money 

Although methodology includes TA (tech analysis)... 
TA is incomplete and there are other methods that work well. 
Many methods can be used in combinations. 
If anyone tells you otherwise, thank them and be on your way. 

You should read EVERYTHING here in sequence... 

If you skip something, just ONE little idea or a few paragraphs...   
you will kick yourself when you start losing money and realize the info  
you need was skipped over. THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME. 

Facts about myself:  

My 75% success in trades generates big profits; they exceed my living expenses.  
I knew NOTHING about trading when I first started and I paid the price. 
Opening a local day trading school, but I promote ETHER over  BTC 0.79% . 
Follow  BTC 0.79%  intensely; it predicts ETHER movement. 
Do not consider myself an expert in TA, but I am one of the best traders I know. 
Formerly a trusted and respected psych therapist.

					SECTION 1 - How to FIND great 'IDEAS' on TRADING VIEW  

Tradingview uses a secret formula to identify top publishers of the day, week and month.It is based on categories, not just performance.  

There is NO quality control with this method. The more times someone makes the top author box, the more they cement their rating.  

It is very helpful, but beware its shortcomings.  

After your first login to Tradingview, bookmark the URL to your browser bar: 

Under the TOP Authors in Tradingview, are vertical columns of the most recent posts. These are usually NOT top authors: 

- Browse visually; then open the IDEAS of those that interest you 
- Select 'FOLLOW' on those members that grab your interest 
- Your limit is 30. After 30, botton members vanish without warning 
- Member posts show on the right sidebar (click LIGHT BULB icon above BELL icon)  
- Once your list hits 20, start unfollowing the less valuable ones  
- Edit your email and notifications for what they publish  
- DO NOT overwhelm yourself (example: I stopped emails and read my sidebar)  

Guidelines on what to say in IDEA Rooms... 

Following others is a great way to learn. 
As you know, you click on their IDEA to see their first chart. 
Observe the date... but note where the price is currently. 
Read everything, even if you do not understand it all. 
This drills terminology into your head... repetition is good. 

Below the last 'comment update' by the author... 
There are conversations that flow -- with most recent on top. 
Scroll down and read ealier conversations. 
Next.. return to the newest comments and try to participate. 
Always look at the ratings of the person you speak with (click their name) 

When you are new, it is best to ASK questions. 
What, where, how and why; pretend you are a journalist. 
Do not advise unless you're a PRO at your topic. 
When you get answers from others, realize they may be right or wrong. 
Those who KNOW are more rare than many who think they do... and don't. 

Never be rude, never use bad language.  
If you disagree with someone, be respectful. 
Isolate the idea, write clearly, do not attack the person. 
If someone attacks you personally, they are damaged, do NOT forget that. 
If you see bad language, click the FLAG by the comment and report them. 
DO THIS EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT SPEAKING TO YOU.

					SECTION 2 - How to single out the GOOD Idea Authors 

Member popularity is not a gaurantee of quality work. 

Thus this section is one I do NOT like discussing; but it's my ethical duty. 

There are many great authors on here... and just as many with poor skills or hidden agendas. 

To find the best forecasts and advice, you must do your own emotional profile of the author. Fact: Trading is HALF psychology. This is why bad guidance can impair your chance to make good profits. 

Statistically, 85% of Tradingview members are well intentioned people. However, as an experienced online community expert, I suggest systematic scrutiny for those offering trading advice. The following methods can be applied to members AND authors. 

***PART A - Most Important Character Traits 

-- Relaibility and Accuracy 
(Note) Trades that profit 70 % of the time is your goal 
Do you track the author's forecasts? 
Do they 'play out' as shown on their chart? 
Is their focus on details/strategy... or emotional hype? 
What percentage of the time do they reach their target? 
How often do they come within reasonable range? 
Does the author publish on a regular basis?  
Do they comment on important price action events consistently? 
Do they publish at times it matters most to you? 

-- Ego  
(Note 1) Too much ego can ruin the integrity of an author's work 
(Note 2) You end up with a rant instead of an analysis 
Writer veers off original topic before the conclusion is drawn  
They talk about themselves and emotional content.. often  
Sentence structures are hard to follow (they ramble) 
You are told HOW to think, instead of led to think for yourself 
They say they LOVE YOU too often. Seriously? That's not genuine. 

A writer may come off as RIGID or arrogant when: 
They reply to your comments with hostility  
-(let us assume you did NOT provoke them) 
They shame you for considering methods they dislike 
-(even if accepted by others) 
They rush to discredit you  
-(be ready to back your claims with GOOD research) 

-- Denial 
(Note) Deniers believe their own fabrications  
A denier never admits being dead wrong 
They act as if their errors never happened 
Their charts rarely show alternative price action plays 
Price movement in their charts are vague 
Deniers invent stories/fake facts to hide their mistakes 

-- Misrepresentation 
A good trader NEVER tells you exactly when to buy 
It's fine (and legal) if THEY tell you when THEY buy or sell 
Fake TA; which is more rampant than you think

					***PART B - Secondary Assessment Points 

-- Agenda	 
(Note) We ALL have an agenda. Making a Profit.  
Agendas are wrong when it promotes abuse: 

Some web sites pay bounties to advertise crypto and ICOs. 
They reach out to top web authors and offer commissions. 
Authors may also own businesses that feed off what they publish. 
ALL ARE OKAY.. if they state risk and have ZERO MISREPRESENTATION. 
MISREPRESENTATION can include 'fake' TA to persuade a purchase.	 


-- Bias 
(note) Everyone has bias, even those who try to be objective. 

A great author identifies their own bias. 
Bias is not condemned when it ends up being correct in the final result. 
This still does NOT make it OKAY. 
Bias is BAD when it influences your decision and said outcome turns out incorrect. 
Bias always skews TRUE results.  
Real science tries to eliminate bias in all valid experiments.	 


-- Intelligence 

Authors can use big terms and intimidating charts.. but 
THERE IS NO GUARANTEE it's GOOD TA 

Common sense and experience often 'trumps' science sense..  
... but many TA pros will DENY this. (Ego or Agenda is their problem) 
YES - YOU CAN BE A PROFITABLE TRADER WITHOUT KNOWING EVERYTHING. 

A super intelligent author may be a great person.  
Some are opposite and behave like arrogant children. 
A petty, bratty child is rarely ETHICAL, so be warned. 


-- Sociopaths or Mental Disorders 
(note) Online, you lack a dozen clues that help you see it quickly. 

Researchers recently concluded many business owners are sociopaths. 
They just want something from you. 

Folks with mental dysfunction can be eager to chat, but rarely listen. 
Somes project their faults onto a 'target'... and provoke you.  
You'll know if they are crazy because they cannot reason well. 
Don't call them crazy, just say you are done with chat. 
Then block them.

					SECTION 3  Psychology (Mind Set) of the Trader   

***Part A    

Some of you might want me to rush into how to... 
- Select an entry price point for a trade 
- Establish a trend for the day 
- Spot a reversal of a trend 
- Learn to do your own TA 
- Recommend an exhange or tools for trading 

NOT YET.. unethical without covering MIND SET first 

Establish what kind of trader you want to be... 

Enacting a trade once in a while is not a big deal 
Swing Trading or Trading on occasion is stressful 
and DAY TRADING... you WILL tear your hair out! 
It is also more exciting than a roller coaster 
You will lose sleep and lose weight (at least I did) 

If you follow my guidelines for trading you will.. 

-- Master the rule of 20/80 
(No one in crypto teaches this but myself) 
(I learned it in mathematics and marketing classes) 
-- Learn to stay CALM during big uncertainty 
-- Better handle the 'Fear of Missing Out' (FOMO) 
-- Become more confident in your trades 
-- Make good money over and over, while losing less 
-- Develop your own GOOD method for trading 


TEN TOP RULES 

Mind Set Rule 1 - Prepare 
Never start a trade without being prepared 
This means getting online and having all your 'tools' ready 
I will cover those tools later on and provide a checklist 

Mind Set Rule 2 - Resist FOMO (covered in detail later) 
You will NEVER miss an opportunity 
Why? For each one you miss, 9 more are coming! 
You don't know what they are until they are upon you. 

Mind Set Rule 3 - Avoid Negativity 
It hurts trading. Bad day, bad mood, tired? Don't trade. 
If were arguing with nitwits in an IDEA room.. Don't trade. 

Mind Set Rule 4 - Talk to those IN THE KNOW 
Do not seek your friends opinions about trading 
They don't get it.. UNLESS they are traders, too. 

Mind Set Rule 5 - Keep CALM 
You only LOSE YOUR ASS when... 
You leverage money you do not have 
Work with crazy amounts of money 

Mind Set Rule 6 - Practice First 
Pretend to trade... before you trade 
Emmulate trading without MONEY 
Make a bet with yourself and follow your trade 

Mind Set Rule 7 - Panic is a Disabler 
Pertains to top 10 coins only: 
If buy cyrpto and price drops you have NOT lost money 
That money is only lost when you SELL 
If you hold, you will get that money back 
Hence, never PANIC during price crashes 

Mind Set Rule 8 - Positive Environment 
Watch the market even if you are not trading 
Visit GOOD TA ideas and rooms on Tradingview 
Read LOTS of GOOD NEWS OUTLETS  
Get as much sleep as you can, eat well 

Mind Set Rule 9 - You win if you believe it 
Never give up, FIGHT THE FEAR OF LOSS 
Bad trades lead to good trades 
Experience is your teacher 

Mind Set Rule 10 - Adhere to Strategy 
Never abandon a good trade strategy 
Strive to improve your trade strategy 
Test your strategy by using it

					SPECIAL BREAK DOWN SECTION 

RULE 2 - FOMO - The Trader Killer 

When I first began trading, it was periodic 
This occured in a neutral market, trading ETHER 
Finished with a bit over $ 400 profit (after fees) 
Was working with $ 1500 capital, no leverage 
Do the math, that's a damn good return 

Made the decision to day trade... 
And my FOMO addiction began. 
Became terrified of missing any big price movements 
Lost sleep, lost weight, started losing money. 

Learned to stop my losses. 
Perfected my TA, Wild Theory, Law of 20/80. 
Returned to making great profits. 
Regained all my lost funds, doubled profits weekly. 

Then started reading about FOMO and its dangers. 
Decided to learn to beat FOMO. 
and do this while still making great money. 
Motiviation? Regain control of my life. 

It worked. Still miss big trades and just shrug. 

When I logged my profits vs habits... 
THE SPREADSHEET DATA IS STARTLING 
Profits were nearly the same when comparing: 
- A week of non-stop trading with little sleep 
- To strategic trading.. and when I was in the mood 

How FOMO destroys your reasoning: 

You make a series of trades with great profits 
Suddenly you watch price movement non-stop 
Small trades get you excited (real addiction starts here) 
You sleep less and eat less (or more) 
You fear leaving the house, fear missing movement 
Many of your frequent trades make profit.. but 
- A majority pull in very small amounts, some are losses 
- You make serious judgement mistakes 
- You do HALF your proper TA before buying in 
- You skip other methods that STOP you from a trade 
- You get back in too quickly after getting out 
- Friends are annoyed; alt coin is all you talk about 
- Little else interests you 

Broke my FOMO habit by commiting to HODL (holding) 
Decided to resume trading when I was back to normal 
Tested myself; resisted a few of my own BUY forecasts 
(Even got followers who said they profited on my forecasts) 
Was happy MY ADVICE was STILL GOOD, happy I was normal again. 

More advice: 
Prepare a check-list of things to do before you trade 
Watch price movement at the 5 minute charts and 1 week 
Beware knee-jerk reactions to sudden price drops 
Watch when a price drop stops at a support trend line 
Not all lines are strong, price often continues down 
Give more weight to general trend, market VOLUME 
Visit all the TA in Tradingview you can handle 
Create a plan, execute your plan 
DO NOT TRADE ON WHIMS OR PURE FEELING 
always question when you 'feel' FOMO

",Long,42,0,1
1530125354,MarcPMarkets,ETHUSD:  Bottoming Formation Materialzing Around 423 Level.,"
 ETHUSD -0.71%  update: Similar to the bottoming pattern in  BTC 0.04% , this market is now in a high probability area to retrace. What makes this market even more interesting is the fact that the current low is still no where near the 374 low. A rally here is not only a broader sign of strength, but offers greater potential compared to a counter trend retrace. 

Earlier today on S.C., I published a  BTC 0.04%  article about bottoming patterns. They are usually made up of a series of structures, but what makes them most significant is where they are developing.  

The pattern is actually clearer in this market than it is in  BTC 0.04% . The 418 low is not that much lower than the 450 low, a  pin bar  is present off the 423 reversal zone boundary and now a  spinning top  is materializing off the same level. Together, these structures could be the beginning of an inverted  head and shoulders  formation which is  bullish . 

If this pattern continues to unfold around the current price level, it would also be establishing a very broad higher low formation. I wrote about this in a previous report that looked at the  Elliott Wave  count. 

The potential target for a broader higher low formation is the 581 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  structure). This will not happen over night, but certainly within reason over the next month. 

In summary, like I have been writing on S.C., we always consider the broad probability of the location when evaluating levels and trends. We do not rely on oscillators or moving averages for these situations because they are not the most effective tools for anticipating broad reversals.  

For that reason we manage inventory as well as short term swing trades when the risk makes sense. At the present, the reward/risk is favoring both position and swing trade strategies long. It is all a matter of having a process to quantify that risk and decide if it is within the scope of your tolerance. 

If the current  spinning top  closes and the next candle takes out the high, that is a technical trigger to go long. We are long  BTC 0.04%  so we will not be officially calling this trade idea in order to keep risk within the scope of our overall plan.

1530137651,Jack777,ETH double bottom try,"
Hey guys, ETH is trying for a  double bottom  at the 420 area, I talked about this in today's episode of the Crypto Chart Analysis (description in my status). 4h EMAs 12 & 26 clearly act as resistance right now in ETH/USD, just like in the direct correlation of  ETH/BTC              => That means ETH is relatively weaker right now. So when playing ETH, always look at  ETH/BTC             , a move in  BTC              might be more leveraged with ETH, depending on the direct correlation. 

This is still highly  bearish  terrain: In order for the bulls to change the trend, we definitely have to get above the 12 & 26 EMAs, on the Daily break the Lower Highs around 480 Dollars & essentially 550 -otherwise the bulls haven't proven anything to us.

1530156385,TomProTrader,ETH/USD - Trading Opportunities,"
So it has been a while since I have written an  Ethereum -1.03%  analysis.  Ethereum -1.03%  is trading between a  resistance zone  between 474 and 463 and a  support zone  between 421 and 411. Price movement was looking quite strong since bouncing off the horizontal support and we could see an up move to the side-wards resistance. Price has been weak with the last 2 2 hourly candles, but the selling is very minimum at this time and some buy orders could see price negate the last 2 bear candles quite easily. 

Price in the short term needs to make a decision whether it will go higher to the resistance, or lower to the support. If price goes to the support, this will create a triple bottom pattern and would almost inevitably cause some buying even if only for the short term. If price goes to the resistance, I believe price will probably find resistance at the horizontal  support/resistance  transition level and fall lower again. Whatever happens within this zone will ultimately decide if  Ethereum -1.03%  completes a long term  bearish flag  pattern which would far surpass the  support zone  outlined on my chart. If price hits the resistance, stays within the zone and picks up move momentum, over time the bulls might be able to negate the long term  bearish flag  in play with the long term trend and se  Ethereum -1.03%  up for some highs, even if only for a while. 

Leave a LIKE and follow. I would really appreciate it. :-)

1530169180,BlackPapaya,BROKEN SUPPORT LEVEL - Swing trading for ETHUSD,"
THE TRIGGER:  
Ethereum -1.03%  has broken below the strong support at $450. It can now slide and move towards the next  support level  at ~$358. 

Trading Set Up: Not trading the correction back up but looking to take short positions once the price recovers a little.  

Obviously the 200EMA is showing an overall downtrend since the start of May so we look to only short to avoid trading against the market.  
The time frame that we are looking at is the 4h candle. (For medium term trades - 1-2 weeks position)  
Current Price is at $433 which is kind of in the middle of nowhere so we aim to get in the short position only when 
-The price traces back to the 50EMA (~$470) or the white  resistance area  at 490.  
The take profit level will be at the next  support area  @ around 390-400 or the bottom of the channel at 350, 
with the stop loss at around 525, just above the channel and at the 200EMA  

(Giving us a risk reward ratio of about 2.5 to 1)  

And of course, this trade is based on the  bearish  outlook of the crypto market and by taking this trade you need to know that you are betting that the market will not have a strong bounce back up within the next 2 weeks.

Looking at 45min, 4h, and the 1D here...I see the down trend from 1400 continuing...the major  trend line  that I ran off the first 360, is being challenged here at the 420 area. If it breaks, there are historical levels (marked 350, 250-300, 200 (yes it is in play if this  trend line  does not hold)). We might pause or bounce off any of those levels. However, it is safe to say the longer term up trend  pitchfork  is done. My personal stance is we are looking for a new bottom, and the  volume  and level of  volatility  at 420 does not feel like blood in the streets. 

I'd be shorting on a break of 420 and covering no higher than 295. It is going down.

All in all, overhead resistance is very strong. It needs time and right setup to pierce through. But you can see that 367 level is very an important level and should bounce back to  pivot  at 536 where coincides with the overhead resistance. This formation is also known as the  bearish flag  which will turn into another  bearish  move down to former  resistance level . After enough time passed on the low side, it can pierce through the overhead resistance in a head and shoulder pattern.

Nothing too complicated, just a general point of interest that may provide sufficient support for ETHUSD's next leg higher (at least until it hits  trendline  resistance). This trade setup does not assume a long bias just because the trade direction is ""long"" -- this setup assumes a buy-side broker, i.e. asset purchase through Coinbase / GDAX, etc. without the capability to short an  ETHUSD -1.36% CFD             . 

This one is for those of you who play the Crypto Casino on the weekends. I'm not here to debate the merits of blockchain and a ""fair value"" estimate of ETH in its current environment. I am still  bearish  in CC's until I see more  bullish  behavior in the market. 

I do not own any ETH at this time, but I do have a limit entry set on GDAX for the following trade.

How confusing ETH/the whole crypto market can be these days? 

Personally imo*, and by the way it looks for now, this is highly likely to be a  falling wedge (I repeat HIGHLY likely!). This would be a good long shot at ETH, with a possible stop-loss, if and only if the bottom channel of the  Falling wedge  is decisively broken(Great risk/reward shot here). Why would this be highly unlikely? Due to the number of times in the past few weeks, ETH has been respecting the said channel(red  rectangle  areas). 
I do think however, that this is a typical whale play in order to tap out/Stop-loss all the weak hands, before the price can move up. The current channel that the price is moving in(unless there's a breakout on D-the falling peaks pattern drawn on the graph), it just does not make sense that Etherium , would move more down and follow the  falling wedge  bottom channel because it would take quite a long time to reach the next ret/support 0.93 at 388. And this would just be a  falling wedge  inside a  falling wedge , which should have a massively  bullish  outcome. 
Pair this with the recent uptrend in the  BTCUSDLONGS              , and the fact that etherium has been in the past few month alwaays a step ahead of  btc              , I'm definitely long this time on etherium- playing in for the bull trap. 

Overall, if the week ends with a green candle(above 454), I'd see a good probability of a  bullish  reversal and a breakout out of the  falling wedge (Targets 586/714). This market is not dead, yet. 

Do comment your thoughts, additions or critics, as this is quite a critical time for etherium.

Now, we are approaching the price range of 370-400. Though it's a mirrored level, I think buyers do not have the strength to hold it, against the background of falling  BTC -0.04% . 
Therefore, I predict that we test it or with a rebound to the price zone 450-500, or immediately. 
The price zone 280-310 - has a large accumulation of buyers, which in the past due to this accumulation made a move up to $ 1,400. 
I expect from this zone a rebound to: 
1) $ 380-400 
2) $ 450-500.

Indicators based on channels, bands and  envelopes  are designed to encompass most price action. Therefore, moves above or below the  envelopes  warrant attention. Trends often start with strong moves in one direction or another. A surge above the upper  envelope  shows extraordinary strength, while a plunge below the lower  envelope  shows extraordinary weakness. Such strong moves can signal the end of one trend and the beginning of another. 

With a moving average as its foundation,  Moving Average Envelopes  are a natural trend following indicator. As with moving averages, the  envelopes  will lag price action. The direction of the moving average dictates the direction of the channel. In general, a downtrend is present when the channel moves lower, while an uptrend exists when the channel moves higher. The trend is flat when the channel moves sideways. 

Sometimes a strong trend does not take hold after an  envelope  break and prices move into a trading range. Such trading ranges are marked by a relatively flat moving average. The  envelopes  can then be used to identify overbought and oversold levels for trading purposes. A move above the upper  envelope  denotes an overbought situation, while a move below the lower  envelope  marks an oversold condition

1530320757,MarcPMarkets,ETHUSD: Short Squeeze Setting Up. Can Lead To 490s.,"
 ETHUSD 3.37%  update: This market is poised to rally. The break of the 443 previous candle high was a long trigger. I am not calling any trade ideas on here because that is what S.C. is for, but I will highlight the potential. 

Price went as low as 405 which looked ugly, but the key is how the candle closes. This candle that established the low closed strong, and it this materialized off of the 423 reversal zone boundary. A  bullish  sign to say the least. 

I have been writing on S.C., that these markets are bottoming, but it takes time and a lot of patience. The structure and location have been weighing probability on the side of strength, even in the face of the recent  bearish  price action. 

The current low of 405 is not dramatically lower than the recent 450 swing low. Along with that, all of this price action is still occurring well above the 374 historical low. This sums up to a broad higher low formation and  BTC 2.93%  is doing the same thing basically. 

If these markets rally, a short term expectation is at least the 490s for this market. That is a conservative view since the short term  bearish  structures are still intact and must be considered until they are taken out.  

In summary, broader structure and location are panting a picture of reward/risk that is skewed toward the  bullish  side across these markets. The  bearish  structures that are still in play suggest conservative expectations would be most appropriate for size, target and stop. 

Remember that market bottoms are a process and take time to develop. In that process lows can be tested and retested before any meaningful progress on the long side unfolds. Any new swing trade long ideas that we take on S.C., will be shared with our followers.

I wanted to start a new thread because we have a lot going on with ETH right now in these charts.  

This post is going to look at potential scenarios of when ETH is going to get more of a SUBSTANTIAL run up. Or when the BOTTOM of ETH could appear, maybe soon? 

Let's first start with some technicals. Weekly  MACD  is still moving down heavily and weekly  RSI  is still not in oversold territory. The Daily  MACD  is still drifting down and  RSI  still has not reached oversold territory yet. the concern here is that because we are in a down trend that we will continue past this bottom in a simple  ABCD pattern . Until we break this orange  trendline , this is a possible scenario. I will address 3 key questions here with various charts. 

Q: Sherem, What are you looking for to see if this is the bottom? 
A. For this to be a bottom we need to invalidate that large ORANGE  trendline  that I have on my chart here. Let's look back in April when we had that large rally where a couple things occurred: 
1. That down  trendline  was invalidated by a long sideways movement which had a move up and then found support again. 
2.  RSI  went into oversold territory and we are not there yet. 
3.  MACD  had a nice cross and we rallied hard. 

Right now we are not there yet. If we break that orange  trendline , I want to see a test of $500 and a pullback for an entry point for a move to the upside.

Comment:
					Q: Sherem, What do you think it could do on a shorter time frame? 

A. This chart is zoomed in with that orange trend line. It's critical that we break it and create a ""higher high"" which still hasn't happened yet, even with this large push. We have created a series of lower lows in the last month. This usually indicates that we continue to get a move lower. For me to feel comfortable entering a trade I want to see some sort of push higher or pattern that indicates we will move higher. 

We did have some ladders down here that have been adjusted periodically. If you got filled you should be in a good position and be able to book some profits or put a stop loss on your position to protect your profits.

Comment:
					Q: Sherem, why do you think it could go down even lower? Shouldn't this be the bottom? 

A. The best comparison I have is when ETH hit it's double bottom back in March at 600. A lot of people thought this was the low, but it blew through it and went down to 400. We can look to ETH/BTC for the answer to this. ETH/BTC had just broken the upwards trendline and started to move down. We were already in a strong downtrend and ETH/BTC further ratified the move down. What happened next on ETH/BTC is that we then created a ""higher low"" and broke this trendline. If this continues on pace, it's going to be a slower move to the downside. We have a couple places we could base out and while I think .04 will be more likely, we will have to see how it plays out.

 Ethereum 3.77%  has perfectly followed my previous analysis, so well done to all who followed the analysis and profited from it! Price hit a horizontal  support zone , and then bounced up to the side-wards resistance. (See related ideas for more details of this idea). The idea played out to the end, and now it is time to update this analysis so we can further track Ethereum's movements to maximize our profits. 

At present price completed a measure move target for a  bearish flag  pattern which hit a horizontal support between 405 and 394 and then price aggressively bounced since. Price is now approaching side-wards resistance, which coincides with a horizontal  support/resistance  transition level. 

There is 2 ways that price will now act: 

1: Price will bounce at the  support/resistance  transition zone between 463 ad 476 before bouncing down lower towards swing low at 405 and 394 before the next bounce. The  support/resistance  level also coincides with side-wards resistance, so this is likely a strong resistance ceiling that definitely needs to be watched out for. 

2: Price breaks the side-wards  support/resistance  transition level, and the side-wards  resistance level , breaks to the upside target at 512. 

Bear in mind that if scenario 2 plays out, that when the side-wards  support/resistance  transition zone will likely end up being retested as a new  support zone  before the upside move begins. 

I will continue to update this analysis if it gets enough views/likes.

1530375028,This_Guhy,"ETH Versus BTC, A tale of two resistance lines","
The pump across almost all coins yesterday was a pleasant surprise for those that are hoping for a recovery but there are some serious technical barriers that give me pause.  First, for  ETHUSD 2.27%  we see this pump did not get us to the either the overhead resistance in red, and didn't come anywhere close to the log resistance line in blue.  A look at  BTCUSD 2.22%  will see that the first pump that occured before midnight UTC took  BTCUSD 2.22%  to the normal resistance line, and the second pump had us bumping along the log resistance line 






So technically the  ETHUSD 2.27%  pump wasn't as strong, or we didn't get as much as we could, compared to the  BTC 2.22%  pump.   BTC 2.22%  still sets the tempo for crypto and we see that  BTC 2.22%  is grinding against the falling log resistance line.  The conspiracy theorist in me thinks that the short squeeze was aimed at targeting the relatively high number of shorts, and we will soon see a rare long squeeze to go after the longs, which are at their highest point since early April. 






And all that can happen with  BTCUSD 2.22%  and  ETHUSD 2.27%  staying within the macro pattern they are already following.  I am taking my  ETHUSD 2.27%  trade cues from  BTC 2.22%  and the log resistance line has held strong.  I strongly suspect  BTCUSD 2.22%  will go down and we will see  ETHUSD 2.27%  fall along with it.

1530376938,KiaCryptiola,Can Ethereum become bullish again?,"
Today, there was a rejection in the price around $467, the 78% retracement level, in ETH against the  US Dollar -0.89% .  Ethereum 2.27%  then failed to break that resistance and declined back till $435. Despite the pump in all cryptocurrencies last night, the price is currently in a  bearish  zone, signaled by the light green  trendline . 

If there is a break above the Fib level at $467, then the price could aim to the  trendline , as a next resistance. Only once it closes above it,  Ethereum 2.27%  could become  bullish  again.  

RSI  and OBV show some  bullish  signals, but it is still early to confirm if the uptrend we saw in the past hours will be sustained with enough buying  volume . 

After that price level of $467, the next resistances that ETh may face are $500 and $530, where  POC  lies.

1530378676,trashpanda19,ethereum fractals,"
 Ethereum 2.27%  short term is still channeling down the  falling wedge . Yesterday the support line was tested again and held firm. The price bounced back to mid 400's and is going to seek the higher regions of the resistance line. We could have a breakout there, but I would rather see one more downtrend to 370-360 region, which should provide a solid support. As the trading range gets tighter the margin of profit and reward/loss ratio diminishes significantly. The closer to the apex the price gets, there are not a lot of sellers left because...there is nothing to sell. However, I have been saying this for awhile, I would rather see the price drop as low as 310-300. The turnaround might take some time because there is a tough resistance hanging on top and there are no shortcuts to overcoming that.

ETH logically moved up during the last hours while stayed within the descending  wedge 
Since May ETH used to drop each time it gets close to the upper part of the descending  wedge  which is now more or less the equivalent of the  EMA  10day  
Same behavior when the  RSI  comes close the the line you can see on the graph. 
ETH drops again when the above mentioned situations happen together with a moment of low volumes.   
 
So, if early July, ETH is close to the upper part of the  wedge , with a  RSI  close to the line I made, with low volumes, I will probably short ETH with a target price at 400$-390$.

This rally is good but we are still in bear, but close to getting the fuck out of it. 

We need more bank turmoils, and stock have to finally give way as FED tightening their positions. Basically FED is doing their best to stall stock rally via interest rate increase and tightening on loads and access to dollars.

1530398074,Peymana71,ETH Analyse.What happened if BTC didn't turn market to Hell?,"
Hi Guys, 
Honestly,I promised myself not to publish any Analyse about Alts and Assets till their free themselves from  BTC -0.64%  pressure but i really can't resist to this Signs and  Bullish  Outlook here,in Alts market. 
Most important thing here is that many of Alts printed a new low with  BTC -0.64%  except ETH.With all pressure of  BTC -0.64%  we saw that ETH ,didn't close to its last lows,even.It was very important sign that show us all this downwards forced by  BTC -0.64%  and maybe if there wasn't any  BTC -0.64%  in market we have much different moves in them. 






Another thing is too obvious is that whole downward in ETH formed a big  Bullish Wedge .In  BTC -0.64%  market it is not that clear like here or many other alts.This  wedge  is near to work perfectly but like always  BTC -0.64%  can change all our expectation again.If all thing go well with  BTC -0.64%  i have 2  bullish  possibility here based on future  BTC -0.64%  move again.If  BTC -0.64%  go up from here we will continue our upward in ETH with red arrow and if  BTC -0.64%  want to find some support in little lower target,ETH will go up like Black arrows. 






Actually if  BTC -0.64%  moves ETH lower,it will form a iH&S that will be really Good.All Things here show us that ETH and most Alts are like a spring that compressed by  BTC -0.64%  and wait for a release. 
We have great signs in  RSI  and have a  bullish  reversal in  MACD  D time frame too. 






To understand better what stop ETH in last bounce,you have to see this chart exactly.As you can see we have a huge triangle formation like  BTC -0.64%  in ETH.I draw two most possible bottom for this triangle in red and black dotted line that show you with arrow in chart.we are stock between this two line and oldest one work as resistance for ETH now,But i'm sure if  BTC -0.64%  went much higher ETH didn't stop here but can't look at it as a accident.After we bounce out of this  bullish wedge ,ETH have a huge resistance about $600 that is roof of that huge triangle. 
Don't forget that  BTC -0.64%  can ruin all this signals and we need to focus on it when enter an Alt trade.I usually suggest my friends to trade in Alts in each  BTC -0.64%  short term/mid term bull market because they are much more profitable than  BTC -0.64%  but must be careful, BTC -0.64%  move down can fell more in Alt market and can destroy your entire portfolio.

The teal zone will determine the direction. This will be proven given previous price action. We won't see a trend reversal until we stop making Lower high's and make a higher low.  

Either should be played out one way or another (unless consolidation). Watch  BTC -0.63%  as well, as that pair usually predicts where all altcoins are going.  



Nifty 1.18%  tip: Buy altcoins. Many coins are already down 80-90% from their ATH's. If the price goes lower, buy more to average down your buy-in price. 

Alt season is coming eventually. So might as well get in on the fire sale and load up positions while others FOMO like we saw at the end of 2017. Don't be that guy, be the smart money:)

There's a wonderful  inverse head and shoulders  currently taking shape on the  daily chart . IH&S patterns are trend reversal, breakout patterns.  

If the price runs up the right shoulder, consolidates, and breaks above the neckline on the other side. That would be taken as a confirmation of trend reversal. 

However, one should keep in mind that this is a long forecast and would not be confirmed until 7/19.  

Tenkan/Kijun are both ranging meaning less volatility/momentum.  

My  TRIX  is smoothed out to have very accurate buy signals. We currently see a bull cross taking place for a buy which further confirms this chart pattern.  

Stochastic RSI  would need to continue it's rise, test the resistance at ~80 before bouncing off support at 34.

 ================ 

This idea will help you fix your Position if you at a loss  

Say you bought ETH at $1000 with $5000 K 
and now you lose about 50% just have $2500 

How can you fix your profit? 

You just need to add more $1000 new money  and follow our plan  

in the End, This $1000 average of profit will be 275% or more  

Mean this $1000 Become $3775  

and Your old Position from $1000 when reaching the target at $850 will have lost about 15% 

means your equity capital $5000 Become $4250 

And your $1000 you manage it becomes $3750 

Total capital will be $8000 with profit 

Total of your Equity Capital is $6000  

Now you have $8000 means you have profited more Than 30% of your Equity Capital 

How you make That? 

just Calm and Smile and use your mind :) 
and ask Allah reconcile and repay

The purpose of this analysis is to provide a quick review that captures over 6 months of price action in  Ethereum -1.05%  starting from the beginning of the collapse in price in January till present date. The following numbers indicated on the chart are discussed below: 

(1) The major  bearish trendline  in  Ethereum -1.05%  ( ETHUSD -1.05% ) after a price close of ~$1379.90 on January 13, 2018. Price closing above ~$644.43 is the most conservative entry point into a long (buy) position identified in this analysis. 

(2) A price close above the green  bearish trendline  is less conservative than in (1) above. This calls for entry into a  bullish  position once price breaks the  bearish trendline  at ~$471.55.  Trendlines  (2) starting from $807.65 on May 6, 2018 is used in this analysis as part of the process of monitoring the evolution of the  bearish trend  in  Ethereum -1.05% . 

(3) This range lies between ~$407.64 and ~$349.18. This range =  support level  1 and is expected to provide support for  Ethereum -1.05%  ( ETHUSD -1.05% ). 

(4) Price breaking through  support level  1 will be expected to find support between ~$289.60 and ~$229.59 which marks the boundaries for  support level  2. 

(5) The  relative strength index  ( RSI ) is shown here with a negative slope. A break above the falling slope and also price action breaking above the green  bearish trendline  will provide a great confirmation signal to buy  Ethereum -1.05% . Also of important notice is that the current  pivot  in  Ethereum -1.05%  with the previous low does form a  bullish divergence  with the  RSI .  
This implies that the bears are running out of momentum and therefore a  bullish  move is possible. 
Based on the principles of prices remaining range bound, any breakout in price to the upside would be expected to at least return back to the start of the  bearish trendline  in green (2) which is ~$807.65.

1530500406,MarcPMarkets,ETHUSD: Bearish Trigger Near But Higher Low Likely To Form.,"
 ETHUSD -1.10%  update:  Inside bar  has materialized which sets the stage for the next move in this market. With the  bearish  structure still intact, an attempt toward the 392 reversal zone boundary is likely. The structure to watch for though is a higher low formation between current prices and 392. This would be the  bullish  confirmation that a broader movement toward higher prices is in progress. 

I wrote in my previous reports that the recent short squeeze in these markets could be the beginning of a broader move higher. The general price area of these markets, especially  BTC -0.59% , present reward/risk scenarios that are skewed toward the  bullish  side.  

And part of the motivation that can help these markets along can come from a weakening Dollar. I published an article earlier on S.C. that explored this relationship further. 

At this point, ETH as well as  BTC -0.59%  are facing the first  bearish  obstacle. The mid 440's is where the  bearish trend line  is located as well as the lower boundary of the broad 544 to 464  support zone  (.618 area of recent  bullish  structure). If price breaks back below the low 440s, it will be generating a sell trigger and can lead to a retest of the 400 low. 

If 400 is taken out, 392 is the next reversal zone boundary relative to the 404 low. That is the location to look for reversal candles like a  bullish pin bar . 

A close below 392 opens the possibility for the test of 374 which would be a  bearish  sign to say the least. As S.C., we are anticipating the higher low scenario because of the magnitude of the initial spike on Friday. 

In summary, if the higher low can materialize, it would justify a swing trade long idea (which will be shared with followers on S.C. if we take it). A push off a higher low can take price back into the low 500's at least.  

If price action stays tight, it can also form a shallow higher low and squeeze earlier than expected. This would be a higher risk trade because of the general lack of follow through and  bearish  obstacles still in play. In this scenario, we will wait it out until the  trend line  is at least cleared before considering such aggressive setups.  

You will be in the game longer if your biggest mistakes are missing trades, rather than forcing trades. Missing a trade does not drain your capital, while forced trades drain it quickly. Just something to think about.

The whole crypto market celebrates  Facebook -0.97%  decision as  Ethereum -1.10%  has made his way upwards on Saturday following  Bitcoin -0.59% . ETH/USD has almost no changes in the past 24 hours, but the momentum during the weekend was huge. The currency pair seems to change its moods to positive. 

When we look closer at the Hourly chart we can see that  Ethereum -1.10%  has crossed $417.28, $431.42 resistance areas and is currently testing $453.24  resistance area . We have a  Flag pattern  here as well meaning bulls have chances to drive the currency pair even higher, targeting the next resistance at $473.29.  
If buyers will be able to reach this green flag area, they will test it and once successful, they will be able to drive ETH/USD higher. 
However, we advise to pay attention to the red flag as well. If the  Flag pattern  fails to develop, the price will fall towards the  support area  at $431.42.

1530532167,Trade24Fx,Kenji signals: sell ETHUSD,"
Today, the indicator ""Kenji"" on the daily  ETHUSD 3.61%  chart generated a sell signal.  

Let's give some explanations on this signal. This is the ordinary signal to open the trade with a basic  volume  .  

According to the indicator, the price of  ETHUSD 3.61%  is currently in the active downtrend phase (the area between the fast and slow average is colored red). At the same time, current prices entered the sales zone, which led to the formation of a ""sell"" signal. This short position remains relevant until either the market conditions change (for example, the downtrend changes to flat or uptrend), or a signal to close it appears (a red cross indicating a strong divergence between the price and average values).  

Recall, work in a trend is one of the most comfortable and potentially successful trading options.  

For reference:  

The ""Kenji"" indicator is a brand new look at the average analysis. The main problem of most trading strategies and indicators based on the average analysis is a number of false signals in the case of flat and trend reverse (for example, frequent crossings of the averages, frequent changes in the direction of the averages, etc.). As a result, averages analysis cannot show its real power and effectiveness.  
The Kenji indicator using a unique algorithm avoids the most common average analysis traps and significantly improves the quality of signals by determining the current state of the market (using the color indication ""Kenji"" shows the current state of the market: red color - downtrend, blue - uptrend, green - flat).  
It generates signals for comfortable trading in a local trend. The indicator provides information on both the timing position opening and the moments of profit taking. It also helps to determine the level of aggressiveness of a signal. This makes the ""Kenji"" indicator a very useful tool both for novice and experienced traders.

Ahoy traders, 
here's my long term view on ethereum: 

The Market had strong move upwards from the  support zone  ($400 - $422 levels) and is already breaking above of 0.786 fib level which is good indication of recovery in the process. The chart is showing us  Falling Wedge  pattern and measured target for this pattern is around $660 - $700 levels. Upward movement is also supported by the  bullish divergence  which is known trend reversal pattern. 

Volume  is giving validity to the break out once it happens because without  volume  it has higher chance to fail and push price lower. 

First  resistance zone  is good for taking partial of the profit and it's likely to have minor retrace from that area.

#Ethereum  bearish  count considering that we are in the  ending diagonal  C in  ABC  subwave of wave Z in an  overall WXYZ correction since january 2018 high.  







This count will be valid if eth doesn't manage to break above the 20DMA resistance level:477 with conviction. 

20 DMA resitance has been a strong  resistance level  for  ethereum 0.10%  so far. 

Earlier eth bounced from the 200ema support in 3D t-f and is facing 9ema resistance in 3D t-f 







Bullish scenario: On the other hand if ether manages to break above the 20DMA level then next it will look to target the 50DMA at 577. 

In this scenario the bearish count will be invalidated and we will be seeing a 1-5 subwave of the larger A wave in an  ABC  correction upwards with the subwave 5 count around the 50DMA resistance 560-580 








Now since  btc 0.19%  is volatile right now and the alts are heavily dependent on btc's movement so lets see what aprrox btc's movement can lead to the above  2 ew counts from  ethereum 0.10% .

Things to note: 

1. Volume profile  indicator showing the point of control as a solid  support level . 
2. Daily oversold  RSI  favours the bull case. 
3. Descending  wedge  structure - common  bullish  reversal pattern - testing the top of the trend-line now. 
4.  Elliot Wave  count gets the checkmark.  
5. The 23.6 fib on the major move looks like a promising TP target 1 

If ETH does get the  bullish  reversal, you can expect the entire crypto market to see some nice moves -  BTC              likely rallying into the low 7's. I would sure love to see it. 

Best of luck.

Forgot to add a strong SR @ $6. It probably will be the most strongest support, since it's already tested good, unlike any higher horizontal support line, but I doubt it will go there, $6 is pretty much a steal in my view.

 Ethereum -1.08%  follows its allies as the currency pair shows more than four percent growth in the past 24 hours. ETH/USD reached its targets on yesterday and tested the  resistance area  at $473.39.  Ethereum -1.08%  stops there for a while but we think it has still some fuel to develop its growth on Tuesday. 

The currency pair has left the  Flag pattern  on Monday-Tuesday and went upwards according to our expectations.  Ethereum -1.08%  managed to jump off the  support area  at $453.24 and reached the  resistance area  at $473.39. It seems like ETH/USD has already jumped over $473.39. We have drawn another  Flag pattern . 
The main scenario for the nearest future is  bullish . We think that  Ethereum -1.08%  will start to grow from the Flag again and reach the next  resistance area  at $500.36. However, the currency pair may also retest the current  support area  at $473.39 before further growth.

Hello Traders, 
ETHUSD -1.09%  has broken out of the  falling wedge  and sitting at D1 20  SMA . We also formed a nice rounding bottom in weekly chart. If we can continue with the uptrend, ETH can see 560$ in near term. Please keep in mind that we will need to retrace a little after the nice price action from the past couple of days. I will be buying some now and reinforce my positions around 450$ 

Entry: 450 
Target 1: 530 
Target 2: 560 
Target 3: 650 (If we manage to pierce through the major resistances and completing the D wave of the symmetrical triangle) 
Stop Loss: 430 

This is not a financial advice. Good Luck

Hello friends!  I have just spotted a potential  VST 1.48%  trade on  Ethereum -1.08%  ( ETHUSD -1.08% ).  Pay no attention to the dates as I don't control the trend so they may vary.  The trade entry and exit prices are as stated in the Forecast indicator.  This trade will be invalidated should price fall below $460. 

Note: I don't encourage  VST 1.48%  or  ST              trades as they offer marginal profit so just take this as a reference.

1530615992,TheChartGuys,ETH Back to EMA 12 Support on the 4 Hour,"
After seeing continuation last night to a higher high, we have seen more significant consolidation to cool off  RSI  levels.  
The notable difference in the previous consolidation is that it was upward sloping and did not cool off  RSI  levels.  
This gives a ""wedge"" patten that often leads to a bear break and pull back.  
Also worth noting the triple top on  BTC -0.45%  which held back the bulls from any significant continuation.  
Now we patiently wait, keep an eye on consolidation  volume , and see if the bulls can hold this 4 hour  EMA  support again, just like the last period of consolidation did before the  bullish  continuation and another leg up. 
",,134,2,10
1530620696,MarcPMarkets,ETHUSD: Next Test Of Support In The 430s?,"
 ETHUSD -1.87%  update: Price is hesitating just under the 494 to 518 minor  resistance zone  after taking out the  bearish trend line . This is a tricky situation because at first glance, this market appears to be forming a lower high and following the recent ""trend"". What is not visible is the probability of the location of  BTC -0.72%  which we have been reiterating is  bullish  and ultimately determines where all the coins go. 

No matter how we analyze and examine this market, it is going to do what  BTC -0.72%  decides to do. The only reason why I take the time to evaluate the levels and formations is because it is a way to quantify risk specifically for this market.   

Since the  bearish trend line  has been taken out across all the major coins, at S.C., we are anticipating the next retrace to present a higher low. For this market, that means looking for a reversal pattern somewhere in the 430's.  

If price falls through, then 392 is the reversal zone boundary to watch for  bullish  candle formations. Again this movement all depends on the sentiment and order flow of  BTC -0.72% . 

In summary, the higher low that we are waiting for may not happen the way we anticipate. Especially in this holiday market, price may consolidate and squeeze a little higher unexpectedly. 

At S.C. we are only interested in probabilities, especially on a broader magnitude. When these markets begin to align with our expectations, the next step is to refine the risk. One way we do that is using specific entry criteria that either the market will meet, or it will not. This is an imperfect process that does not catch every opportunity, but it serves a much more important purpose. It filters out a high frequency of trades with negative outcomes, preserves capital and allows for unemotional binary decision making. The benefits are definitely outweigh the occasional opportunity cost. What is your process?

 Ethereum -2.08%  completed a nice up move as planned in my previous analysis up to 480 and has since had reversal candles implying we will have a correction at this level (See related ideas for previous analysis). 

There is 2 ways that price will now act:  

1: Price will correct into a nearby localized horizontal  support zone  between 458 and 446 before bouncing to the upside. I expect the upside move will create sufficient momentum to at least retest the side-wards resistance line, with the possibility that it can break structure, and go to the upside. Price could see highs of 507. 

2: Price corrects into the mentioned zone above, before hitting side-wards resistance once again and stalling. This stall would create yet another retest once again at the horizontal  support zone  between 458 and 446. Once price completes the test, price will be trapped. It can either break the side-wards resistance, or it will be forced to stall, and break the horizontal  support zone . 

Bear in mind that if scenario 2 plays out, it might take a considerable period of time before the upside begins.  

I will continue to update this analysis if it gets enough views/likes.

From the point of view of the medium-term upward trend, the formation of consolidation - it is good 
This means that in these ranges there is interest, and depending on whether buyers or sellers win in this range,  
we will see a continuation of the downtrend, or the beginning of an uptrend.

 Ethereum              stopped its uptrend on Tuesday as the price failed to work another  bullish Flag . ETH/USD loses more than four percent in the past 24 hours but still looks  bullish  as we think this decline is nothing more than a simple downside correction to the previous uptrend.  

Ethereum              declined on Tuesday-Wednesday and reached the  support area  at $453.29. The currency pair formed a  bullish Hammer candlestick  pattern right on its support line with a fake breakout, meaning  Ethereum              is ready to burst upwards again. 
If this works and buyers are successful,  Ethereum              will be able to reach at least $473.39  resistance area . We think that this target is enough for Wednesday. However, if buyers gain momentum, they will be able to drive the currency pair even higher. 
This is the main scenario for today, but we should not forget about bears. They are also able to develop this downside correction even deeper. The price is likely to reach the next  support area  at $431.42 in this case.

1530695383,Luettis,Ethereum on its way to 1.500$,"
The title suggests a rocketing movement of the token ETH. And in the long run it´s quite possible. 

What are the conditions for this projection? 

1. ETH has ended the long decline and entered a new motive wave 
2. The chart patterns (trend channel and swing  trend lines ) have to be broken up - of course some intermediate correction have to be taken as normal 
3. the fib retracements are resistance lines (38,2% / 50% and 61.8% seem to be stronger than the others) - so once they´re broken they consist as support  
4. beyond 992$ the air becomes thinner but the resistances won´t be so strong as before 
5. with higher prices the momentum gains strength -  volume  will come back 
6.  Ethereum 0.75%  is reaching a new  ATH -1.03% 

As mentioned at point 2 - some intermediate correction are normal. But none of them should stop the  bullish trend . 
Ethereum 0.75%  has proven its use case and is widely accepted - even when some problems occure from time to time. It´ll has to change from PoW to  PoS -1.41%  (casper-protocol) and solve the problem with the scalability. And no one knows what happens when all ICO´s based on  Ethereum 0.75%  begin to trade with their own tokens (and not the ETH).  
I´m conviced that Vitalik Buterin (and the other developers) will find new role models and improvements for  Ethereum 0.75% .

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.80%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

if this keeps playing out as a triangle... just an idea tho

this guy that poked through the support is a bit of game changer, now price reached fib 0.3 of both moves. 
We could now be doing a shallower version of that triangle. 
We'll know if we touch the top instead of turning south at the orange target.

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.96%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

this guy that poked through the support is a bit of game changer, now price reached fib 0.3 of both moves. 
We could now be doing a shallower version of that triangle. 
We'll know if we touch the top instead of turning south at the orange target.

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully

Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

if this keeps playing out as a triangle... just an idea tho

this guy that poked through the support is a bit of game changer, now price reached fib 0.3 of both moves. 
We could now be doing a shallower version of that triangle. 
We'll know if we touch the top instead of turning south at the orange target.

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.41%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF -0.17%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns

If we look at  BTC 0.72%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

if this keeps playing out as a triangle... just an idea tho

this guy that poked through the support is a bit of game changer, now price reached fib 0.3 of both moves. 
We could now be doing a shallower version of that triangle. 
We'll know if we touch the top instead of turning south at the orange target.

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  .

4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.83%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

this guy that poked through the support is a bit of game changer, now price reached fib 0.3 of both moves. 
We could now be doing a shallower version of that triangle. 
We'll know if we touch the top instead of turning south at the orange target.

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully

Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

if this keeps playing out as a triangle... just an idea tho

this guy that poked through the support is a bit of game changer, now price reached fib 0.3 of both moves. 
We could now be doing a shallower version of that triangle. 
We'll know if we touch the top instead of turning south at the orange target.

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.50%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns

If we look at  BTC 0.75%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

if this keeps playing out as a triangle... just an idea tho

this guy that poked through the support is a bit of game changer, now price reached fib 0.3 of both moves. 
We could now be doing a shallower version of that triangle. 
We'll know if we touch the top instead of turning south at the orange target.

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.84%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.30% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.50%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.50%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.67%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.67%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.80%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.80%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.50%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.50%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.52%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.52%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again.

 Ethereum 1.72%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.72%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.72%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum              is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

 ETHUSD 1.52%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

					BTW, since we are right under the downtrend line, a nice short opportunity exists. The probability of success is PRETTY LOW, but the reward/risk ratio is very good.

 ETHUSD 2.02%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope!

480 is the last zone where bears will continue to push prices down as we saw this week. If that key zone is taken out you can expect bears to close out and get stopped out and you can expect buyers sitting on the sidelines to join, causing a rally to possibly 540 area. If bears win, bulls will get trapped if 450 is taken out and you can expect a rally down to 422 again and depending on momentum possibly lower to continue the downtrend.

o	Transaction costs for  Ethereum 0.88%  have been much higher than usual over the past few days. It is reported that miners have been collecting 10x more fees than average over the past 5 days. It is reported that this increase is caused by a cryptocurrency exchange China, FCoin, which has inappropriately incentivized users to deposit tokens. As a result, there has been an influx of ERC20 tokens. The reason for the deposits is because FCoin is letting users vote via depositing tokens for its next cryptocurrency listing. The exchange’s voting process is a cumulative deposit number ranking process where each deposit of a token counts as a vote towards the listing. Blockchain data from ‘Gaz Guzzlers’ section of EtherScan allegedly show a correlation between the top voted tokens on FCoin and the ‘Gaz Guzzlers’. The gas prices, which are usually 5 Gwei, have risen to 50 Gwei because users on the  Ethereum 0.88%  network have brought their transactions to the front of the pending transaction line. This has raised the average fee from USD$.20 to USD$3.50 within 48 hours.

The  Ethereum -2.41%  rate finishes its correction and prepares to drop. 
Priority of the day: decrease of the  ETHUSD -2.41%  rate with a target of $ 420. 
We waited a long time for the end of the  Ethereum -2.41%  price rollback to continue to work on a downtrend. Our plans include the search for an entry point for the sale of  Ethereum -2.41%  near the levels: $ 480, $ 470. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD -2.41%  rate will drop from $ 470 to $ 420. 
2. The  ETHUSD -2.41%  rate will remain in flat one more day. 
An alternative scenario: 
For the broad picture of the  Ethereum -2.41%  sales, we need movement upwards, to $ 490, $ 500. Therefore, a small momentum of  Ethereum -2.41%  rate is possible, with a subsequent drop to $ 420, $ 400.

Hello traders,  

Been in the crypto space for already 7 months and i feel the learning curve is finally giving its rewards.  

Been working on this one together with jfiedler using  elliot  waves with yesterday after catching the last drop.  

BITFINEX:ETHUSD 0.17%  is reproducing the last  fractal  in a higher scale, right now we are in the final  ABC  before a possible move up to the 505 - 515 range wich should hapen this afternoon/evening.  

You can see also de  MACD  is moving to the upside.  

If you decide to jump in be sure to sell when the upside is done, will be posting more updates on catching wave low point and selling tops.  

I am personally  bullish  on this one, as you usual this is a personal opinion and i am not advising to buy any digital asset, just my opinion.  

Cheers,  

Roberto

1530898239,Jack777,ETH Equilibrium -Break coming!,"
Hey guys, hope you're aaaalll doing fine! ;) ETH is right now in a clear tightening pattern with the 4H Lower Highs of 480 and the  Double Bottom  at 450.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, it was a healthy consolidation, with upholding the previous bullflag, but surely inside the equilibrium the bears were stronger with  double bottom . Eventually it is going to depend on big brother  Bitcoin -0.46% . In the direct correlation of  ETH/BTC             , we're still trying to maintain the 0.07 as support. 

If  Bitcoin -0.46%  manages to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs. 

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)  

About myself: Global citizen & early  Bitcoin -0.46%  adopter from Germany. I invested in the 2nd rally from 50 to 1.000 Dollars in  BTC -0.46% .

The  Ethereum              rate is still in the lateral movement. 
Priority of the day: a decrease in the rate of  ETHUSD              to $ 410. 
We stick to our vision of continuing the fall of  Ethereum              to the nearest low. It is not excluded that near the zone: $ 410 - $ 400, buyers can take the initiative in their hands. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD              rate will drop from $ 480 to $ 410. 
2. The  ETHUSD              rate may continue its lateral movement for another day. 
Alternative scenario: 
The rate of  Ethereum              can exit flat upwards, to $ 500. 
Naturally, then we will incur losses on  Ethereum              short position.

1530950597,bibboyne,Bullish Breakout Awaits for Ethereum (ETH/USD Analysis) - Update,"
Good day, my friends!  This is an updated chart for my previous analysis titled “Ethereum –  Falling Wedge  Reversal” dated July 4 (three days ago) which remains “valid” until today.  This new chart, however, should give you a clearer view of how price is going to hit our target. 

Now let’s take a closer look at the short term setup in the the 3-hour chart.  There have been some positive developments on the  Ethereum              (ETH) trend recently so let us go through every one of them. 

1.  The purple lines outline the  Falling Wedge  that price has been trying to breakout from. This is a  bullish  sign. 

2.  The  bullish  symmetrical triangle as outlined by the green lines are still intact and valid. This is another  bullish  sign. 

3.  Several breakout attempts below the triangle were quickly reversed. This shows that we have more ready buyers to get aboard the moon ride than sellers (mostly weak hands). Yet another  bullish  sign. 

4.  What was previously a  Rising Wedge  ( bearish pattern ) has now turned into a  Bullish Channel  as outlined by the tangerine lines. This is the best  bullish  sign because we can now clearly see how price has a good chance to hit our target range as highlighted by the red box. 

Keep in mind that those who trade with patience and consistency are often rewarded.  What we want is to look for profitable trades (like this one, for example) regardless of how long it takes to reach our goal.  After all, trading is meant to be boring so a piece of advice - please avoid scalping (day trading) unless you are a very good trader.  Even so, no trader is “that” good to be right all the time. 

Please do check out some of my other charts below under RELATED IDEAS.

Hello crypto traders,  

I update my chart for  BITFINEX:ETHUSD -0.20%  as i was missing an entire  elliot wave  cycle i did not spot earlier. Now its fine.  

I am expecting one more dump to the inferior triangle line acting as support. I am currently out as i sold the top of the triangle and looking for an entry around 460, then i will wait for the pump to happen.  

Remember to set your stops, this is crypto.  

Have a nice weekend.

1531003536,MarcPMarkets,ETHUSD: Triangle Points To Strength. Noise Offers Better Entry.,"
 ETHUSD -0.34%  update: As price consolidates, the formation that is unfolding signals further strength. A break above 476 and this market will be facing the 494 to 518 minor  resistance zone . Obviously a break out in  BTC -0.48%  is key. We are more interested in any retest of lower prices for either a failed breakout or higher low scenario. 

Triangles are typically trend continuation patterns. The standard buying of breakouts during these formations is not a bad idea if you are feeling aggressive. At S.C., we have been long term  bullish  for months but it is not in our plan to be aggressively  bullish  on the short term. 

We anticipate high probability opportunities IF this market, along with  BTC -0.48% , offers any retest of lower prices. This can unfold in the form of a failed range breakout on the  bearish  side, or a higher low structure around the 423 reversal zone boundary. 

We choose this more conservative stance because the 571  resistance level  is still intact. This is the .382 resistance of the recent  bearish  structure relative to the 838 high. It helps us determine if a broader  bullish  movement is in progress or not.  

Since it is not, yet, the short term is more likely to be in a larger range bound environment. Like I have written numerous times, bottoms are a process and that process offers plenty of entry opportunities if you know what they look like.  

In summary, there is nothing wrong with taking a  bullish  break out if the next leg higher unfolds. We will not call it as a trade because it is better managed as a day trade in light of the risk and speed of change in this market. 

We navigate these markets according to the criteria set forth by our plan and so should you with yours. We also have to consider risk in light of the fact that our choices can also affect the actions of our followers which is why we lean more to the conservative side. 

As the short term price action transitions back to  bullish , there will be a lot of noise. The most attractive opportunities will be the lows of this noisy range as long as a decisive new low is not established. Plan ahead for the possibilities and be prepared for those scenarios if they appear. If any swing trade opportunities present themselves, they will be shared with our followers.

n last review we wrote about the balance of  supply and demand  near $ 500. Since that the rate has declined a bit. However, under $ 500 there is a demand and it seems to exceed supply. At least now.  
So, equilibrium price has been found for current market conditions. Ether has started to drift and it has been fluctuating under influence of casual wind gusts. To move further there is a need for stronger and sustainable wind: changes of market conditions. The change of market participants behavior is needed. Studying the history of last year we can suggest that this drift will continue till autumn. Moving averages will cross. The fluctuations will fade near them. Only then the wind of changes will fill sagging sails of the ship with a proud name Ether. And it will continue its way. To further blossom or to dusk the time will tell. And our reviews too, of course:)

ETH has been held down by descending resistance (orange line) since its last run up on May 5th. It has finally broken free of  it, but we want to confirm it's not a throw-over first. I'll be very  bullish  if we correct out of this ascending  wedge  and bounce off either green box. Preferably the lower one, as we could get a wick below the orange line to test the bulls and establish support hopefully. Confirmations are much stronger if tested and proven to hold above/below.

Since May ETH was in a downtrend. But after the reversal on the end of June an upward trend is already developing. If it can close above the major resistance at 490 USD it may have a probability to perform an  elliott  rally. Both  RSI  and  MACD  showing a positive outcomes in the near future. Besides this some  volume  spike might be needed for the boost. Other than that it would be a good potential entry for those who get this currency less than 500 USD at all. An easy 100% profit is expected in the mid term investing opportunity and plan.
