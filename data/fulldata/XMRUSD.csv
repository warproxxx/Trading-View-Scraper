The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD 0.50%  and  ETHUSD 0.67%  being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

We in general are still in a downtrend for XMR, so I would be pretty careful.

We in general are still in a downtrend for XMR, so I would be pretty careful.

This is the market cap (kind of outdated, I should change the coins but I'm just not in the mood). I'm gonna keep it simple this time. One line that describes a lot of potential ;). Never forget to look at the big picture. You don't understand the behaviour of a Termite colony by studying the ant solely.

1530147885,johny_button,Monero to make first UP run ! step up to the plate,"
Good day trader enthusiasts, I am the real Johny Button the Elephant hunter and i have a nice scenario to share, 

Looking at Coin Market Cap the crypto market cap has hit equal lows for this year at 245  ish              billion. Thats a  support level , and if the market sways this will break and plummet...but i have a good feeling this wont happen, as the industry news is positive, institutions are coming in, and SEC is working so this can happen. . . everything is positive in the world, the revolution is about to get started Im feeling. 

So looking across all majors, Monero xmr is making some moves to the possible upside. It has triggered some indicators: 
1. Made this triangle / wedgy thingy (white lines), tagged 3 times the lower support, 2 times on the top resistance 
2. On this last dip the past 2 months we have broken some key resistance (pink lines), making a ABCDE, which made this 3rd tag on this lower larger support (white line) 
3. come to a critical test point . . . the 21EMA (blue line), and the previous high.  
4.  MACD  looks good as being oversold, showing 3 down waves, and crossed over for an up move 
5.  RSI  has risen to the good level of a climb signal 

So if we break the 21EMA and this last high it means that the last people that bought at this high (before the recent dip in the last days) will either want to cash out and break even, or stay in as new buyers join the race. This second scenario means the public thinks it is time to rise. 

That will mean a drive up to the 55EMA (white  EMA  line), to test the C wave level next . . . and if that breaks we will make a tag to the large upper resistance of the triangle wedgy thing . . . and if that break we will keep playing the test level game. Optimistic?  

So there you have it, lets start at the first point and see if this level breaks. Monero is a market leader i find in these market dip situations. i dont know why right now, but i see it make first moves in the past before  btc             , and before others, which means i am watching this carefully to see what pans out. 

As for buying i will wait a while to see if my 21EMA level and yellow line break before entering anything. First swing for that wave C level at that point. 

Yours sincerely, 
Johny Button

1530275249,JohnnyPurtoy98,XMRUSD - Bearish moves coming!,"
The price has broken out the bottom ( support level ) of the  descending triangle , this has given a massive signal for further  bearish  moves to be taking place, cryptocurrencies are no longer being hyped up as much as they used to causing the currencies to lose momentum, I believe that these currencies would be falling for a while yet, but I do believe these currencies would move up later in the future as they are fully developed and understood and used by many more. Once these cryptocurrencies start being used more I believe their price would start to rise at a substantial rate.

Closer look of bull case scenario

Comment:
					Keep in mind that this works only if Wave is V is aborted aka Flat or double bottom. 

This rally is good but we are still in bear, but close to getting the fuck out of it. 

We need more bank turmoils, and stock have to finally give way as FED tightening their positions. Basically FED is doing their best to stall stock rally via interest rate increase and tightening on loads and access to dollars.

1530710515,ligand,Monero next cycle to start,"
a full cycle brought us from 7 to 107 USD. Now the next cycle, which is a wave 3 could start. If a similar ratio can be expected, price would be at 1635 USD after the next full cycle  (and the corrective move at its end!). But most often a wave 3 is longer than a wave 1, so an even higher increase might be possible. 
",Long,22,0,0
1530734742,ForecastCity,There is a trading opportunity to buy in XMRUSD,"
 Technical analysis: 
. MONERO/DOLLAR is in a range bound but the beginning of uptrend is expected.  
. The price is above the 21-Day WEMA which acts as a dynamic support.  
. The  RSI  is at 54.  
. The  RSI  downtrend & The price downtrend in the  daily chart  are broken, so the probability of resumption of uptrend is increased. 

Trading suggestion: 
. We have already opened 10 BUY trade(s) @ 126.17 based on 'Two-Day reversal candle ( Hammer  in D2 time frame)' entry method at 2018.06.29 in our suggested  support zone  (130.00 to 106.00).  

Beginning of entry zone (130.00)  
Ending of entry zone (106.00)   

Entry signal: 
Signal to enter the market occurs when the price comes to ""Buy zone"" then forms one of the reversal patterns, whether ""Bullish Engulfing"", ""Hammer"" or ""Valley"" in other words,  
NO entry signal when the price comes to the zone BUT after any of reversal patterns is formed in the zone.
