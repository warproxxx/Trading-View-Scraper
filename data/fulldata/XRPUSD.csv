After trying to bring the XRP back to life - they met with the sellers. I am waiting for the breakdown of the triangle down and working out the tired on big timeframes. However, when breaking the triangle up - buyers are waiting for problems at 0.49-0.495 and at the price level of 0.51.

1530021929,Exsilium,$XRP #Ripple - Near Term Bottom Sill In Play - Still Bullish,"
Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC -0.07%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO 0.00% , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term. 

=========== 

As always, this is my personal observation and analysis of the market and is not intended to be trading advice.

Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC 0.09%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO 0.00% , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term.

The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO 0.00% , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term.

Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC 0.02%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.

Hello Traders, 

In this analysis, we will have a look at XRP/USD in the 4-hour chart. 

Down from 04/24/18 peak, Ripple is showing an incomplete 5 swings sequence to the downside. 

Ripple completed the cycle from 04/24/18 in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5428). The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii -1.36% )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052). The internals of red wave A unfolded in a 5 waves  Elliott Wave  impulse, where it ended black wave ((i)) at the low of 06/05/18 (0.6338). Up from there, black wave ((ii)) correction was complete at 06/07/18 peak (0.6862). Below from there, it ended black wave (( iii -1.36% )) at the low of 06/10/18 (0.5553) and the correction in black wave ((iv)) at the peak of 06/11/18 (0.6038). Below from there, it finished black wave ((v)) of red wave A at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5045). From that low, it ended red wave B correction at the peak of 06/15/18 (0.5684). 

As long as bounces fail below 0.70 peak, then XRP will be looking to trade lower toward equal legs area 0.28 – 0.18 before ending a 7 swings double three structure. Up from there, it will be looking to bounce higher in 3 waves at least.

Below from there, it finished black wave ((v)) of red wave A at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5045). From that low, it ended red wave B correction at the peak of 06/15/18 (0.5684). 

As long as bounces fail below 0.70 peak, then XRP will be looking to trade lower toward equal legs area 0.28 – 0.18 before ending a 7 swings double three structure. Up from there, it will be looking to bounce higher in 3 waves at least.

Hello Traders, 

In this analysis, we will have a look at XRP/USD in the 4-hour chart. 

Down from 04/24/18 peak, Ripple is showing an incomplete 5 swings sequence to the downside. 

Ripple completed the cycle from 04/24/18 in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5428). The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii -0.50% )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052). The internals of red wave A unfolded in a 5 waves  Elliott Wave  impulse, where it ended black wave ((i)) at the low of 06/05/18 (0.6338). Up from there, black wave ((ii)) correction was complete at 06/07/18 peak (0.6862). Below from there, it ended black wave (( iii -0.50% )) at the low of 06/10/18 (0.5553) and the correction in black wave ((iv)) at the peak of 06/11/18 (0.6038).

We expect today to see a small increase in the rate of Ripple to $ 0.50. It is not the best place to look for the deals: the downward trend, so it is too early to buy Ripple. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.45 to $ 0.50.

Ok, so this post might seem ridiculous, but hear me out. We've seen this repeatable pattern of breaking resistance, extreme growth, and then a following consolidation and new resistance formed many times now, and it's conceivable that when we break resistance this time around, we'll see another period of extreme growth followed by consolidation and new resistance... etc. 

So how does this play out practically speaking, based on what we've already observed? 

This video is highly speculative, of course- but it's in fun, and the market is boring right now, so why not. I'll save this link and revisit it a year and a half from now from my villa in South of France since we're dreaming.

A  descending triangle  has formed, this usually shows signs of a bear move, but in this case we could see the price break out the  resistance level  of the triangle. We would have to wait and see for the direction of this pair and I would be posting regular updates to keep everyone updated about what is happening with this pair. The  RSI  is at an oversold level meaning the price may make its way back up and if it has gained enough momentum may even be able to break, a break is very likely as the triangle has become very narrow.

Ripple has added almost two percent in the past 24 hours, but still looks neutral as the price is within the range without any direction. The price is above the descending  trend line  meaning bulls have chances to change the situation in the nearest future. 

When we look closer at the situation on the Hourly chart we can see that Ripple is trying to test the  resistance area  at $0.4744, but still in vain as the price retreats from this level. Even though Ripple looks  bullish  now, it has to jump over this resistance in order to develop its upside progress. The possible scenarios for XRP/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will move towards the closest support to test it. If bears are able to move below $0.4495, they will develop their downside progress. 
2.	Orange scenario (neutral). This one is the most likely for Thursday as we think the price will stay within the current range without significant changes. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). Ripple will jump over the resistance at $0.4744 to move higher targeting the next resistance at $0.4918.

I am a long-term holder of XRP.  It seems the current cycle has been great for buying but terrible for selling.   It doesn't look like that is changing soon. 

The current pattern for XRP in conjunction with the pattern  BTC 0.47%  is on will likely bring us to lower levels in the immediate future. 

It looks like XRP will hit at least .43 before we see any reversal.  Much of this will have to do with how low  BTC 0.47%  goes. 

I think we are at the tail end of whatever this last consolidation period has been about.   BTC 0.47%  below $6000 is bad for everyone - but especially bad for coins like XRP. 

Some people feel like they missed the big crypto opportunity and they are too ""late to the game"".  With today's prices and more people  
""in crypto"" the upside is better than its ever been. 

Crypto has only begun as an asset class - we havent seen a fraction of what it is capable.  XRP is a real project with real potential.   

We are in a position right now where XRP is extremely affordable given its potential.  Whether you choose to take advantage of the opportunity or not is up to you and your due diligence. 

Lets hope this downtrend ends soon and those of us buying can enjoy the fruits of our labor!

1530204397,MAGICMARK,Ripple ... not making waves ... yet.,"
Here's another coin I don't like, although I was there when my son showed me an algorithm that said ripple was going from 0.6 to over $3. It was right. I didn't believe my son ... my son reminds me of this often. 

Anyhow, is it game over for ripple (the banker's coin)? 

Let's look at the two previous recoveries ... it seems when we crossed either the blue or red  trend line  from the two previous peaks, we had a rally.  

In this instance ... it's not reacting ... yet.  

We have already crossed one of those two  trend lines  ... last one (blue) will be crossed if it holds at this level in less than 24 hours. 
Now, we might not get an immediate rise, especially if  BTC 0.48%  decides to catch a train south, but it should react within the next 3 to 7 days. 

If it doesn't ... ouch. 

Tonnes of support in the green box, but the range is WAY too wide (down to 0.15).  We are testing yearly lows, and a break below that could send it down significantly.   

Like BCH, if I were to play this coin, I'd wait for a confirmed bottom and pick up the ride going up!

1530205995,Jack777,"Ripple in equilibrium, break coming","
Hey guys, XRP  just like big brother  BTC 0.45%  is right now in a tightening range on the 4H with 0,475 as resistance & 0,454 as support. A break here is coming rather sooner than later, and will see a big move. Of course, the direction will highly depend on big brother  BTC 0.45%  .  

A bear break is looking at 0,438 at least. Should those not hold, next supports in the Daily is 0,40 psychological. A bull break could lead at least to the recent highs at 0,5 psychological.  

=> Since we're in a  bearish trend  , the break of equilibriums always favors the bears, than it does the bulls. But you still have to wait for a clear break, especially with those long wicks & fake-outs. So always be more conservative, miss a few percent rather than getting faked out. Set your orders accordingly, and never forget your stop loss. Look at  BTC 0.45%  before trading here, Ripple isn't going anywhere without big brother. I wish you good luck trading! ;)

Hey guys, 

This is the first idea I post. All of the indicators are showing there will be a reversal soon. Other than the indicators, its is pretty clear that tradingview's chat is extremely  bearish , and that is a major signal that things will turn around. Plus we have already crashed from 10k since the last bull run. If you think that the people who are manipulating this market will just let it crash instead of milking it all the way before it gets regulated, then youre gonna be buying my shitcoins at 8k because youre a sheep. 

I think that there will be a bear trap to aprox. 6500usd then bounce to the 8k resistance... However, i think that  BTC 0.68%  will eventually go back down to 3k or less.... 

Please share your thoughts. Constructive criticism is always welcome :) .

Ripple has lost more than four percent in the past 24 hours, but the currency pair remains neutral as it failed to establish new lows on Friday. The currency pair is above the descending  trend line , but is still unable to move higher. 
 When we look closer at the Hourly chart we can see that Ripple has tested the  resistance area  at $0.4744, but failed to jump over it and retreated later. Ripple has reached the  support area  at $0.4495 on Friday and is currently testing it. The possible ways for XRP/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). Ripple will break through the support are at $0.4495 and develop its downside progress towards the next support at $0.4232.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral). XRP/USD will stay above $0.4495 and fluctuate there, between this support and the resistance at $0.4744. We think that this scenario is the most likely for Friday.

It was mentioned in the previous post that support region for Ripple (XRPUSD) was between ~$0.46 and $0.39, with this region coinciding with the major  bullish trendline  for XRPUSD (Ripple).  

XRPUSD has currently broken below the  trendline , which by itself implies further  bearish  action in Ripple.  Price closing below the lower region of support ($0.39) will provide a stronger evidence for more  bearish  action in Ripple (XRPUSD).  

Ripple (XRPUSD) consolidating within the support region would be a great indication for possible upside potential if the consolidation is confirmed by another independent technical signal e.g. indicators. 
Current market action however favors Ripple (XRPUSD) bears.

1530280928,Exsilium,$XRP #Ripple - Pennant Broke Down - I WAS WRONG - BUY! BUY! BUY!,"
The following analysis isn't going to be particularly helpful. Basically, from my point of view, 2+2 is no longer 4. What I can tell you is this; buy. Why? Because I truly believe in XRP and Ripple as a whole. There is some major traction in users of Ripple products and that will inherently increase the value of XRP. Let me put it another way, this next paycheck.. Im going to add another $4000-$5000 to my XRP holdings. I see no reliable support levels to target for entry below here, and I still think $10 is plausible by end of year. So, that $5000 for instance, at the current 0.42639, would be worth $117,263 at $10. So Im not upset that the price went down from a real-money point of view, Im upset because all the analysis in the world can be wrong and Im not fond of being wrong.  

Ive been watching other guys who post XRP analysis and some have been yellowing for down down down.. but with no reason why, other than following the current trend. I am not trying to call the current trend, thats not rocket science; a 5 year old could tell you what the trend is. I am trying to identify waves, tops and bottoms, so I (and you) can get in and out sooner and maximize XRP holdings.  

We have been wanting XRP to diverge from  BTC 0.68%  for a long time... and it did last night. While XRP is currently down 3.87%,  BTC 0.68%  is up 0.28%. Go figure. Yesterday I did a whole write-up about  Pennants  and Triangles. Over the last night the  Pennant  I plotted broke down, as well as the Sell Signal I plotted. Normally a  Pennant  exit will follow the length of the flagpole. In this case, that would target 0.43. 

I was watching LOI climb steadily last night, but it appears as soon as I went to bed it reversed with about 3 million flowing out XRP on Bitfinex. The part about this data that doesnt quite make sense to me is that there is about 10 million more in XRP now than there was back in April when we were at 0.45. I am trying to correlate this to price action but have yet to solve that puzzle.  

Below here we have the Monthly (P1+P2)/2  Pivot Point  at 0.388055. Next months estimated  Pivot Points  have changed with the new low. Relevant to the current level we have  PP -25.00%  at 0.52, (P+S1)/2 at 0.43, and S1 at 0.34. HA relevant  PP -25.00%  is at 0.58, HA(P+S1)/2 at 0.48 and HAS1 at 0.39. 

Potential, but very weak trend-lines from December are around 0.32-0.33. I see a lot of guys trying to use this, but the data is old and irrelevant to the current price action than it was then.  

The top of the run up in Q2 of 2017 was at 0.39887. I point this out as previous resistance can become support. There is a couple more tops at 0.32 and 0.33. Again, this is super old data, but we are in no-mans land now and trying to find support here is tricky. 

This break lower has violated various  Elliot Wave  rules as currently plotted. I am going to find a way where this fits into EW theory. 

Daily Fisher is now at the same level that preceded the rise from 0.45 to 0.96, as well as the rise from 0.54 to 0.70. So, if your still HODLing, continue to do so. Selling here would just be stupid.  

=========== 

As always, this is my personal observation and analysis of the market and is not intended to be trading advice. I can be, and have been, completely wrong in my analysis. I am not trying to identify a trend; a 5 year old can do that. I am trying to maximize XRP holdings by catching the waves as soon as possible. So, while anyone that identifies a trend can be right 100% of the time, finding those tops and bottoms is difficult and prone to error, but by and large I can increase my XRP holdings steadily.

Hey guys, just like I've been posting yesterday, we have broken the equilibrium in the 4H  bearish  together with big brother  BTC 0.68%  & reached almost 0,422 with more than 6% profit potential .  

So: If you played this like I suggested: Good for you! Now it might be time to take profit (if you haven't so far) & wait for further price action on  Bitcoin 0.68% . We're right now highly oversold in the 4h & Daily with  BTC 0.68%  , and grandpa still gives the direction.  

If you don't want to miss equilibrium breaks next time: Please follow me & watch my daily videos! (description in my status) . I wish you a good trading! ;)

In my last chart I called the bottom at .43 where I hope some of you were able to pickup some XRP. 

XRP like  BTC 1.83%  seems to have hit its bottom (at least for this cycle) and we should be moving up to test some of the higher resistance areas before we move on. 

XRP double bottomed and reversed which is what has brought us to current prices.  Given the direction  BTC 1.83%  appears to be moving as well as the chart for XRP it looks like we will see .50 before the end of the weekend. 

Is this the bottom before the bull run?   Time will tell.   Once we hit .50 the chart a pattern will have emerged that will give us a clearer idea of where we go next. 

It seems like we are entering a reversal period - but I am waiting  for more than a days trading to confirm that.  XRP is still a bargain relative to where we know its going - its still very much a ""buyers market"" which isn't a terrible thing - we won't be see these low entry points for long.

I see a lot of posts on Twitter and a lot of new traders making one very big oversight; the relationship of  bitcoin 1.83%  to altcoins is very important. 

It's important to point out the relationship of  bitcoin 1.83%  and altcoins that a lot of new traders overlook. Not all altcoins follow  bitcoin 1.83%  exactly but most do so it is important to do your  technical analysis  and due diligence on  bitcoin 1.83% .  

Saying that, if  bitcoin 1.83%  drops 10% an altcoin may not dip exactly 10%... maybe IOTA drops 8% or Tron drops 5% but rest assured they will more than likely drop to some extent. Here is a good comparison of  bitcoin 1.83%  vs XRP vs IOTA an you will notice that each peak and valley may be slightly different but the trend it follows matches bitocin closely. 

Trade safe, learning  technical analysis , and stay away from pumps and hype you will just lose money. Myself, if i am part of any social media group and I see a lot of FOMO or pumps and hype I generally leave the group.

HI guys, 
Got a demand to post my TA perspective on XRP. we have a 2  lvl 0.23%  impulse wave. 

Scenario a) retracement 







Scenario b) original post 

with test on a major resistance.  MACD  looking like it will crossover with an intrinseque  double bottom  normally indicate  bullish  outcome. We are now sitting on a major support and are on a compressive zone 







I do not exclude this count but its very unlikely how it is formed  







I dont exclude falling deeper if XRP cannot breach resistance and sell presusre resume : 







Overall the converging price toward his median mean that we are near a bottom zone

1530446816,rgeddes,Ripple - Genius Is Seeing What Other People Don't,"
I am a writer and full-time entrepreneur in addition to trading crypto.  One of the benefits in following a market that never closes - is that huge chunks of time in between trades are mine to do what I want with.  Many of my businesses require the occasional bout of ""hands on"" management - usually this doesn't take a lot of time and  I am able to  focus on both my love of writing and crypto. 

Ripple is a project I have been following from a very early stage.  Many people have dismissed it as ""just another  bitcoin -0.02%  knockoff"" which really does no justice to the project.   Crypto has reached the point where direct involvement in a business such as starting your own crypto project - requires immense risk and funding.   The easiest way to participate in Crypto as an individual investor is to buy the asset directly.   Cloud mining and other forms of paid forms of coin accumulation is almost always a loosing proposition.   Most financial advisers will dedicate 5% of a portfolio's value for higher risk investments.  Ripple as a 17 billion dollar currency is no more risky than investing in mining or some other industry that experiences wild fluctuations.  There is some possible downside - but the upside of investing in this new asset class before the rest of the world catches on - makes the reward well worth the risk. 

XRP is more or less following the pattern of  BTC -0.02% .   BTC -0.02%  continues to move sideways in what is looking to either be a left shoulder or a possible  double bottom .  XRP has similar properties.  When XRP picks a direction after we finish moving sideways - we are either retracing back to .43 before reversing - or we build a head after breaking through .50.   People hate analysts who give them too many options.  The advice is the same in both situations.  If we move down its only a temporary situation before we move back to .50.  If we hit .43 again - take another position.  If we go right to .50 - wait for confirmation of the pattern before we can determine how to play things in the short term. 

Yesterday was a nice break from the  bearish  momentum we've seen lately.   XRP need to break through .50 to move forward - lets hope  BTC -0.02%  stops its sideways momentum, breaks through 6400 and moves to challenge 6800.  If this happens we will see an >.50 XRP in the very near future. 

XRP is still a buy - there is lots of upside for this coin - especially considering it has a recognized project with actual merit.  Short positions are not recommended during the weekend but especially with a chart like today - we can postulate that  BTC -0.02%  will break the 6400 mark and we will head upward - but there is also a real possibility of the price continuing to be rejected and indirectly holding XRP down. 

I personally am still taking positions at this level.  Genius sees what other's don't - weak hands are giving away their XRP ""for a song"" - if you came to the conclusion that XRP was a good investment 6 months ago - it should still be a great investment today.   Many people seem to be abandoning ship - but just as we have seen in previous markets - many of these same people will end up piling back in when we enter our next bull run.

As seen on the chart, Ripple entered again a  Rectangle  on 4H (neutral  RSI ,  STOCH ,  CCI , Highs/Lows), on a recurring Channel Down/  Rectangle  pattern sequence within the dominant 1D Channel Down ( RSI  = 35.326,  MACD  = -0.041, Highs/Lows = -0.0113, B/BP = -0.0444). The price is still trading above the 1D Channel Down median (red dotted line), which technically makes the downtrend less aggressive on the longer term. This is an indication of a possible slowdown on XRP, but not before it reaches our target set: 0.4000 and 0.35277.

Pretty self explanatory. 

Ripple seems to be a victim of it's own success - it's market cap is one of the largest, so pumping it is really expensive, but the % return is not so great.. Maybe the reason it didn't receive much pumping activity since december 2017. 

The double flat bottom looks good, it might start grinding up from now. 

Waiting for confirmation which direction market will go. 

If it breaks horizontal support - probably going into a  descending channel . Could be a flash crash shakeout. Bear scenario is sure only if it stays for longer under the support. 

We're only in the  bullish  territory for sure, once VFI breaks through zero. So far bears could still be in control.

1530537236,rgeddes,Ripple - Peaks And Valleys - What Happens Next,"
XRP has been moving ""sideways"" since the last chart.   There are two circles on the chart indicating where I think XRP will make a decision as to which way to go. 

BTC 3.94%  has been moving in a similar manner and its important to consider what  BTC 3.94%  is doing relative to Ripple. 

There are three possible scenario's that I can see happening - all of them require no action on your part unless you are still waiting to buy (im taking another position myself). 

1) We could continue to move sideways for a few days - with some small peaks and valleys. 

2) The price drops and we  double bottom  at around .43 

3) We move up to .50  and begin to work toward challenging .55 

Scenario 2 and 3 would eventually play out the same way.  A  double bottom  would likely trigger a reversal which would get us to .50 and up from there. 

Moving sideways for a few days isn't a terrible market to be in (unless you are a shorter).  Its an excellent time to take a few positions at some of the lowest prices we've seen in a year.  

I usually trade with technical indicators rather than emotion.  I choose the project I invest in based on their size and merit.  XRP is the third largest coin - its leaps and bounds bigger than most of the other coins in the top 10.  It has real investors, a real business plan and is partners with some very real financial companies.    For those of you who havent been trading Ripple a long time - I recommend you look at the historical charts.  Ripple hit $3 not to long ago.  With the financial sector's growing interest in Ripple I think it would be unreasonable to not believe we will see a $1 ripple within the next few months.  As a top three crypto - its valuation should increase as ETF's and trading desks begin to wade into the market. 

It's amazing how many people doubt the potential of crypto after seeing how quickly it can become valuable.  I've read articles about how ""everyone"" has bought crypto and decided they don't like it.  All 2017 proved is that even though its still very difficult for the average person to get any meaningful amount of money exchanged into crypto - enough people were able to figure it out and drive the price of Ripple 5x what it is now. 

Ripple will rebound in due course- the best move as of right now is to buy and hold.   It could start building a head or it could  double bottom  - the one thing we can be sure of is there is some short term  volatility  that will eventually  share out the weak hands.   If everyone just held  - Ripple would move independently - and the price would be sky high. 

Until then - happy buying!

Ripple develops its upside progress on Tuesday as the currency pair reaches new highs. XRP/USD added more than five percent in the past 24 hours. The  Flag pattern  was true and we have drawn another one which is also viable. Ripple looks very promising currently and seems to have enough power to develop its growth. 

XRP/USD has jumped over the  resistance area  at $0.4744 on Monday-Tuesday and reached our targets. Bulls managed to drive it even higher. The currency pair works next  Flag pattern  currently and seems to jump over the next resistance at $0.5088.  
The main way for Ripple is to develop its growth in the nearest future. We have set a new target at the  resistance area  at $0.5444. XRP/USD is able to reach it even on Tuesday. However, we also think that it may test the  support area  at $0.5088 before taking off.

HELLO! We're back with a not so educational post suited for you lazy asses who just want buying and selling signals.  
We're sure that many of you guys are confused by the super professional and complicated charts in TradingView. Many of you have questions like  
""So..Nice chart but at what price do we actually buy or sell at?""  
""Elliot's wave, HnS, Green  trendline  , Red  trendline  , Black  trendline  , Support, WHAT ARE THOSE!! I just want to know when to buy and sell..""  
We successfully stopped lost in our previous post before  BTC 0.39%  decided to drop to its current lows. Sorry for the -5%, but as always, we are just guys who read charts, not oracles. Even we lose sometimes! :( . Lets gain back more profits in our next few posts! 

Well fret not, cause we are here to save your lazy asses from googling and learning the ""pro"" terms of TA.  
We will be here to give you guys exact Buying and Selling Signals  

No calls for XRP. Stay out of XRP. 
If you are holding onto XRP, continue holding and only stop loss if  BTC 0.39%  breaks below 6300 USD  
Dont worry, we will be following up more on XRP in our Telegram group. 


On the technical part, we'll cut short the story and tell you why it'll be rising or falling:  
1) XRP fell from $0.80 to its current low.  
2) XRP is very indecisive now, the only thing XRP is waiting for before it moons or drops to hell is the clear directions of  BTC 0.39% .  
3)  BTC 0.39%  is still acting as the absolute dictator, so when  BTC 0.39%  dips, ALTS will follow and they will dip even more then  BTC 0.39% , Vice Versa.  
4) XRP is one of the coins that follows  BTC 0.39%  like a very loyal dog!  BTC 0.39%  dips, XRP dips.  BTC 0.39%  rises, XRP rises. No matter how good of a TA XRP is showing, it'll just follow  BTC 0.39%  0.20% in the end. That is what we realised after getting burned by XRP a few times. Hard coin to call. One example is when  BTC 0.39%  dropped to 6000 USD, XRP dropped to its current low of 0.50 USD. 
5) XRP is just not showing any decisive signs of a revival or a drop. The candles are just moving sideways. We DESPERATELY need  BTC 0.39%  to save XRP. 
6) We will move our position to the sidelines in order to keep our capital safe. It is just not safe to invest into XRP right now. We ADVISE everyone to do so too. 
7) Even though we are not going to be putting money into XRP, we are neither  bullish  nor  bearish . Therefore we suggest you to hold onto your current XRP and only stop loss if  BTC 0.39%  breaks below 6300 USD. 

We will be here for the long run in order to scoop up all the +% for you guys and burn away the -%  
For all the information above, you should be able to understand them as long as you learned how to read and speak english. Our posts are as simple as  ABC  but is probably what all of you came here for, which is to have the exact buying and selling signals.  
More coin signals coming soon.  
The main thing that we'll be doing is that we'll make you guys filthy rich.  

Do like this post and follow us if you want to continue getting direct Buying and Selling signals.  
if you have any questions, you can message us or search us up on telegram instead of twitter at ""CryptoHawkSG""  
We love to use telegram instead of twitter solely because we'll be able to chat with everyone in the community.  

We love you guys and we hope to make each and everyone of you rich.

Hello again, updating my chart once again and shall keep doing so till it continues to remain valid..  

We did break through the 0.49 mark that I had mentioned earlier but XRP fought back any further decline below 0.45 mark quite well and continued to stay there, consolidating its stand. The movement is still within the 2nd triangle but is now moving closer and closer to the vertex of the triangle, looking for a break out.  

The current movement of XRP is trying to break above the 0.51 level mark which is within the 0.49-0.51 resistance range, this resistance is further solidified by 1) the extension of the upper  trend line  of last year's pre-breakout period and 2) the 21  EMA  line. At this point, breaking this is the key to further gains  IMO -1.74%  (marked as 1 on the graph), a failure to break this will see a decline again towards the 0.45 level where XRP would consolidate again to make a push (marked as 2 on the graph).  

There is a very very unlikely third scenario, breaking below the triangle, should that happen, we would most likely see 0.31 levels and when that recovery might happen.. well.. I dont think anyone would be interested to know as all would have given up hope :( 

Whether we break this key resistance today or in next couple of weeks is to be seen, but break it will this month, considering the launch of  SBI -0.23%  exchange on the 18th of July and the NASDAQ backed exchange on the 25th of July. For XRP to rise independently, these two exchanges will help in decoupling it from all the baggage that  BTC 0.19%  carries with it.  

I strongly believe that July and September (crucial months) will light the path that XRP will take and in my opinion with all thats going on for Ripple labs, there is only one path for XRP and that is UP. 

Once again, I may be completely wrong and delusional.. so please form your own opinions and trade wisely.. Best of luck to all

Yesterday I plotted a Wave 3/C target as 0.52361 and price hit 0.51978, very near that target. The trick now is to figure out if this is Wave 4, or a new Wave 1 down. My entry point was going to be at the 0.382 fib of Wave 3 which would be at 0.49312, but there are a few things I am worried about and want to watch for confirmations before I buy more here.  

BTC -0.72%  was limited by the Monthly  Pivot , dead on. I hate using  BTC -0.72%  analysis to justify my XRP analysis, but I simply cannot ignore that  BTC -0.72%  influences XRP still. The other concern about  BTC -0.72%  is that it hasnt really retraced at all from yesterday's high of 6667.57, just poking the 6571.23. 4H  RSI  on  BTC -0.72%  is also pretty high but last bar dropped below over-bought. 4H Fisher just turned down. Id want to see the reaction to 6512 before I made a new buy decision. I think  BTC -0.72%  retracing to its 0.382 could drag XRP down to its 0.50 at 0.48489. 

Now heres the really interesting part. Either we just ended the  ABC  correction wave, or we have are on Wave 4 of a  bullish  impulse wave. EW Theory says that Wave 4 cannot retrace into Wave 1, which would be below 0.45411. The 0.50 retrace of Wave 3 would still be above that point, so an entry of 0.485 with a stop just below could be a good entry. As noted before correction waves can be problematic, with 21 potential variations, Doubles, Triples, etc.  

There was also a descending trend-line that also seems to be a limiting factor for XRP, though not as strong as the trend-line above it which is currently around 0.70. 

I will update here and Twitter when I have a clearer buy signal. 

=========== 

As always, this is my personal observation and analysis of the market and is not intended to be trading advice. I can be, and have been, completely wrong in my analysis. I am not trying to identify a trend; a 5 year old can do that. I am trying to maximize XRP holdings by catching the waves as soon as possible. So, while anyone that identifies a trend can be right 100% of the time, finding those tops and bottoms is difficult and prone to error, but by and large I can increase my XRP holdings steadily.

Ripple plays an an important role in the crypto space, and an even more important role within the finance industry in general. Ripples' products serve as an inter-ledger system, connecting crypto and fiat currencies, for easy conversion. As the xCurrent system gets adopted by more and more banks, like Kotak Mahindra for example, Indias largest bank, and as more wallets support XRP just like Wirex will in the next few days, will XRP be the one coin to rule them all?  

The chart tells us there's great support at $0.45 - $0.50 range, but the biggest problem with this coin (for us traders) is that news and other fundamental influences don't do much for this chart. But that is definitely a great sign for the coin itself, when stability is concerned. This is what the banks want to see, is my liquidity going to take a shit if there's a lil bad news floating around, or will it hold up?  

I believe anything under $0.50 will be a great buy for this coin. Hodl more of this long- a couple years long, unload for some profits early on tho. Can we see XRP at a couple bucks again soon? Maybe a Christmas present from Brad Garlinghouse?

Now in the market there is a rollback after a long-running down trend. But are there any facts that can show us that further will be  a strong upward movement? Especially, Ripple is relatively weak with respect to other coins. 
I see a good opportunity to get into shorts at 0.54-0.55 $ with global targets of $ 0.37 and $ 0.29. 
The previous idea of ""trouble for investors XRP part 2"" has not worked out yet. But my targets have not changed and there is a big chance to see them.

Ripple follows its rivals and develops a downside correction as the price loses almost four percent in the past 24 hours. However, XRP/USD still looks  bullish  and able to resume its uptrend in the nearest future.  
 XRP/USD worked its  bullish Flag  on Tuesday unlike other cryptos. However, after reaching the  resistance area  at $0.5088, Ripple failed to jump over it and retreated from this area. XRP/USD declined towards the  support area  at $0.4744 and reached it later. We have a  Doji candlestick , which means that Ripple is able to resume growth in the nearest future. 
What are the targets for today? If bulls are successful close to this  support area  at $0.4744, they will be able to drive XRP/USD higher targeting the next resistance at $0.5088. Is this the final point for growth for the next 24 hours? We think that no, it is not and buyers will be able to drive XRP/USD even higher. 
This is the main scenario for Ripple. However, if sellers gain momentum, they will be able to develop this downside correction towards the next support at $0.4495.

The rate of Ripple sharply bounced from the level of $ 0.52 downwards. 
Priority of the day: the growth of XRPUSD to $ 0.53. 
We forecast a small increase in the rate of Ripple to the target, after correction to the zone: $ 0.465 - $ 0.45. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.465 to $ 0.53. 
2. The XRPUSD rate may not exit flat and remain there. 
An alternative scenario: 
Since the trend is still  bearish , Ripple rate may continue its decline to $ 0.41.

Ripple has tested the lower limit of the negative trend channel. On that support it rebounded and is since then climbing. 
With the better sentiment of the market it should now rise upt to the upper limit of the trend channel. 
On the way up it has to cross a descending  trend line  (resistance). This will take some time possibly. 

RSI  confirms the new trend - it has crossed already the negative trend in the last days. 

The aim for Ripple in short term is 0.69$ - a benefit of 42% approx - on the base of 0,48$. 

Once Ripple will have broken out of the trend channel much higher prices are following. But this will be another analysis.

Hi guys, 

to follow up my past XRP projectio. Heres a macro point of view. I expect for 1-2 weeks that XRP will consolidate in our area. Testing major resitance with retracement to gather steam at support. 

Overall it looks like XRP could  double top  then start retracement : 








On a more macro view XRP start to expand which is a sign of a reversing momentum : 








The information we have is if XRP continue to behave like this. a  bullish  outcome may result :

1530740635,sunny.labana,July and August XRP Short Term Trends,"
This is my first Analysis.  This is a chart I have been using for a few months. 

Here we go: 

Month of July, (~$0.70 Prediction) 

If the uptrend continues we can see it touching the top of the green  downtrend channel . This is a strong downward resistance that has been pushing us down since February.  If we can break this point and sustain above the  resistance area  of ~$0.70 , it would show good momentum.  However we need  volume  this month for confirmation. 


Month of August, (~$0.20 Prediction) 

If we continue with the same volumes currently we will see a reach to the YELLOW zone in the $0.20 range.  This is the bottom in my eyes.  This would push us into the high 90% correction from  ATH -1.03% . On the bright side we have bounced upward from strong support at around the $0.40 mark. The YELLOW and RED zones will be my buy areas.  There seems to line up towards the October-December timeline. 


Conclusion: 

July and August are months to keep an eye on as we start to close the gap.   Volume  will decide weather we see any gains to be made or in my opinion, it may offer a chance for the lowest entry price point for 2018 @$0.20. 

Any comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Ripple reached our targets on Wednesday but retreated later. The currency pair added more than three percent in the past 24 hours. XRP/USD moves along the ascending  trend line  meaning the uptrend is still in force and is able to develop. 

The currency pair tested the  resistance area  at $0.5088 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it. XRP/USD declined towards the ascending  trend line  later. Sellers were unable to push Ripple lower. 
We have a clear  bullish Hammer candlestick  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by jump off the  trend line . This means that Ripple is able to resume its uptrend in the nearest future. The closest target for this upside tendency will be at the closest  resistance area  at $0.5088. 
We also think that XRP/USD will be able to move higher once the resistance is broken. The next target for Thursday-Friday is at $0.5444. As for  bearish  scenario, it is less likely. However, the target for sellers lies at $0.4744.

1530794580,rgeddes,Get Ready To Buy Ripple - Minor Correction Ahead,"
I am  bullish  on XRP as a stake holder - but I can't deny what I see in the charts. 

XRP as I have predicted in previous analysis moved up to the .50 mark after flirting with lows around .42  

It appears we are forming  a head on an  H&S  pattern. We wont know until we have confirmation on the right side - but if you are looking to short the trade you should be looking to sell soon and hold at least until we begin banding around .45 

There is a possibility that we drop to .43 before we make a more convincing run and break through .50. 

I don't expect this pattern to hold more than a few days as weekend traders will likely push it along. 

It's still a great time to take a position in XRP - and if the price drop does happen as predicted - XRP will be an even better deal ~.45 

Those of you in for the long haul - keep holding!

A lot of people are calling for a bottom of this  bearish  downtrend and sentiment is turning  bullish  (perhaps prematurely). We have had a solid bounce the past week and  BTC              Longs have continued to climb whilst shorts/long gap has been growing. I see XRP following a similar to pattern to it's previous dumps and 4hr  MACD  has crossed  bearish . I am currently in no position. When in doubt stay out. If this is the end of the bear market there will be plenty of opportunities ahead. However I am not yet convinced, may change my mind depending on what  BTC              does in the next few 4HR candles. Range has been tightening and a big move is coming, unsure of the direction just yet however I am leaning  bearish . This bias may be my undoing however a trader must protect their capital and this is why I will keep my funds for another day.  Previous all time high is ~$0.40 to ~$0.38 depending on which exchange you look at, I am looking for entries around this area.

XRP has been a bargain at current levels relative to how it normally trades. 

We have been in a bear cycle for some time and it now seems like we are building to break out of it. 

In today's trading I expect to hit a low around .45 before we begin building again and challenge some of the other resistance in the .50 range. 

This weekend should bring us to .50 but it looks like we will dip our toes into the .45 range before we move on up.

In our opinion, the price of Ripple has a small potential for a fall, and further a reversal upwards is possible.

We had got stopped out of the last trade but this one is a much safer set up! So let's talk about what's I'm seeing!  

First this is the currency market been  bearish  for a while and Markets don't trend one way! It's a combination of both  Bullish  and  Bearish  that makes the market moves.  

1. Previously we had an inverted  head and shoulders  at the end of June that spiked the market to .52 High then it was retracing on those levels!  

                 - There was a  Double top  but I didn't post it because I had a feeling that this market is not  bearish  so this move wouldn't have been significant enough for the risk that ensure with it.  

Now let's examine why we are heading up! 

1.  Weekly timeframe  been suggesting a  bullish  movement from the market 
    - We had an  hammer  last week! At support which had suggested the turning point in the market and that is the reason why I have not been selling XRPUSD  
    - This week is suggesting that we could get a  Bullish  engulfing! And putting those two together we should get a morning start at support on the  weekly timeframe .  

2. On June 29th the market gave the first indication on the  Daily timeframe  that a change was coming! by rejecting the downside with a  Hammer .  
        - Past couple days been a really shitty market but today we have gotten a morning start and I expect a continuation to the upside.  

3.  Double bottom  on the lower time frames are suggesting the change in the trend! and we should not be heading up.

Ripple looks less promising than other majors as the crypto failed to establish new highs during the weekend. The currency pair has lost more than two percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair has broken through the ascending  trend line  and moved lower. It is hard to say currently whether Ripple is going to resume its uptrend in the nearest future. 

The situation on the 4H chart is neutral as there is no tendency currently. Ripple failed to jump over the  resistance area  at $0.5088 during the weekend. The currency pair tested the  support area  at $0.4744 instead. 
We have set upper targets for Ripple at $0.5444, but currently we cannot say that XRP/USD is able to reach them in the nearest future as the uptrend was broken. The lower targets are set at the  support area  at $0.4495, but Ripple will have to breakout the closest  support area  at $0.4744 in order to reach it.
