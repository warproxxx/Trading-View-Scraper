BTCUSD -0.71%  reversed off its resistance at 6666 (100% & 61.8%  Fibonacci extension , 50%  Fibonacci retracement , horizontal overlap resistance) where we expect price to fall further to its support at 6160 (61.8%  Fibonacci retracement , horizontal overlap support).

This is still the first peak on the 4H  RSI  since we've hit the ""very bottom."" Ideally it would go sideways overall, hit another valley in the short term, and consolidate before going up. Sometimes it can resist doing that, but the dump just now indicates otherwise. Nonetheless, I'm not buying until at least the 4H  RSI  hits 30. The 4H  RSI  hit 75 after that recent double pump and people were still chanting BUY BUY BUY before it dumped. I knew that was A BAD TIME TO BUY, SO I DIDN'T. I'VE BEEN HOLDING OFF SINCE I SOLD AT 455 ETH. I'm not buying until the  MACD  flips again, or  RSI  hits 30. It will go down quite a bit before either of those happen. There might be some minor bumps along the way, but I don't care, I'm a 1D/ 4H trader.

 BTC -0.63%  is doing what i thought it would do at this stage. I did not get carried away by the recent little run. Will test $6000 again. 
$6400 is the  support/resistance  level now for this  elliot wave  formation to continue to its targets. 
On a  daily timeframe  the  RSI  is over sold. 
3 day and weekly have a cross over and room to grow but whether the momentum can carry remains to be seen. 
Reality Check - Still didnt make a higher high, currently following the pattern of lower highs. Bottom line is $5800 so if a lower low comes we will then look at retesting $5000 with a  support/resistance  at $5300 
No-one really knows where the bottom is. My plan right now, avoid day trades and im not calling trade signals right now. Accumulating bigger top 10 coins at low red candles and being patient.

  The  TD 0.42%  counters show the weekly candle  has counted down 8 candles   and should hit a 9 the candle next week . 
I say *should* as  the  9th -4.01%  candle  can be skipped and  BTC -0.63%  will starts a new count instead. 

Why this matters ? 
==================== 
In TomDeamark  counters a clean  1 to  9  candle countdown on a weekly candle   indicates upwards movement incoming after the   9th -4.01%  candle. 
If   BTC -0.63%  does not hit that  9 candle, and instead moves upwards  then we know the reversal upwards is incomplete and we can expect  further downward movement

Hey everyone, I'm back! Welcome to yet another daily  BTC -0.63%  update. Let's get started. 

Today is Tuesday and we haven't since a slightest peak in  volume  meaning something is probably cooking with the big boys. At this point we know what direction the big boys are pushing the market; DOWN. Tomorrow and the day after are the biggest  volume  day of the week and I am fairly certain the bulltrap is coming to an end. The last few months have shown us that bulltraps usually only last a few days. For that reason I am expecting a drop very soon to a lower low (lower than 5800). If you are betting LONG then your stoploss should be tight because you might get REKT. 

I am short on right now and expecting a drop to the low 5k at the very least 

Who's Becky? What's her background? I am a crypto enthusiast and have been since early 2015. I have already made millions in the crypto world and am financially set for the rest of my life. I recently decided to start helping other people get rich. I like helping people, it makes me feel good. What can I say? I LOVE feeling good ;) . Let's share the journey together!

These past few days , alts have risen crazily with at least 50% gain. Some moved very early then stall at top , then some start rising .  
Before , I was very  bullish  to  bitcoin -0.63%  . However, after observing alts' behavior and bitcoin's pump style. I think this might just be a temporary relief and we will go to 5.2k zone 

Reason: 
-  Bitcoin -0.63%  's pump style is not healthy one. It is  bearish  barking style (not the normal healthy going up style). People will be either miss or hit with the pump 
- For alts, it looks like they are RUSHING to jump up. Yeah I use the word RUSH. Either people are in profit or they will be trapped for buying at top. This is not a typical healthy pump 

In conclusion, if we can't hold 6.3k-6.4k we  will head south which I think the chance for it is pretty high now. If we can hold, we will head north 
This is the time to stay in fiat , not to buy any coins 

P.S : my post is not financial advise.

This is still the first peak on the 4H  RSI  since we've hit the ""very bottom."" Ideally it would go sideways overall, hit another valley in the short term, and consolidate before going up. Sometimes it can resist doing that, but the dump just now indicates otherwise. Nonetheless, I'm not buying until at least the 4H  RSI  hits 30. The 4H  RSI  hit 75 after that recent double pump and people were still chanting BUY BUY BUY before it dumped. I knew that was A BAD TIME TO BUY, SO I DIDN'T. I'VE BEEN HOLDING OFF SINCE I SOLD AT 455 ETH. I'm not buying until the  MACD  flips again, or  RSI  hits 30. It will go down quite a bit before either of those happen. There might be some minor bumps along the way, but I don't care, I'm a 1D/ 4H trader.

 BTC -0.68%  is doing what i thought it would do at this stage. I did not get carried away by the recent little run. Will test $6000 again. 
$6400 is the  support/resistance  level now for this  elliot wave  formation to continue to its targets. 
On a  daily timeframe  the  RSI  is over sold. 
3 day and weekly have a cross over and room to grow but whether the momentum can carry remains to be seen. 
Reality Check - Still didnt make a higher high, currently following the pattern of lower highs. Bottom line is $5800 so if a lower low comes we will then look at retesting $5000 with a  support/resistance  at $5300 
No-one really knows where the bottom is. My plan right now, avoid day trades and im not calling trade signals right now. Accumulating bigger top 10 coins at low red candles and being patient.

  The  TD 0.42%  counters show the weekly candle  has counted down 8 candles   and should hit a 9 the candle next week . 
I say *should* as  the  9th -4.01%  candle  can be skipped and  BTC -0.68%  will starts a new count instead. 

Why this matters ? 
==================== 
In TomDeamark  counters a clean  1 to  9  candle countdown on a weekly candle   indicates upwards movement incoming after the   9th -4.01%  candle. 
If   BTC -0.68%  does not hit that  9 candle, and instead moves upwards  then we know the reversal upwards is incomplete and we can expect  further downward movement

Hey everyone, I'm back! Welcome to yet another daily  BTC -0.68%  update. Let's get started. 

Today is Tuesday and we haven't since a slightest peak in  volume  meaning something is probably cooking with the big boys. At this point we know what direction the big boys are pushing the market; DOWN. Tomorrow and the day after are the biggest  volume  day of the week and I am fairly certain the bulltrap is coming to an end. The last few months have shown us that bulltraps usually only last a few days. For that reason I am expecting a drop very soon to a lower low (lower than 5800). If you are betting LONG then your stoploss should be tight because you might get REKT. 

I am short on right now and expecting a drop to the low 5k at the very least 

Who's Becky? What's her background? I am a crypto enthusiast and have been since early 2015. I have already made millions in the crypto world and am financially set for the rest of my life. I recently decided to start helping other people get rich. I like helping people, it makes me feel good. What can I say? I LOVE feeling good ;) . Let's share the journey together!

These past few days , alts have risen crazily with at least 50% gain. Some moved very early then stall at top , then some start rising .  
Before , I was very  bullish  to  bitcoin -0.68%  . However, after observing alts' behavior and bitcoin's pump style. I think this might just be a temporary relief and we will go to 5.2k zone 

Reason: 
-  Bitcoin -0.68%  's pump style is not healthy one. It is  bearish  barking style (not the normal healthy going up style). People will be either miss or hit with the pump 
- For alts, it looks like they are RUSHING to jump up. Yeah I use the word RUSH. Either people are in profit or they will be trapped for buying at top. This is not a typical healthy pump 

In conclusion, if we can't hold 6.3k-6.4k we  will head south which I think the chance for it is pretty high now. If we can hold, we will head north 
This is the time to stay in fiat , not to buy any coins 

P.S : my post is not financial advise.

BTCUSD -0.68%  reversed off its resistance at 6666 (100% & 61.8%  Fibonacci extension , 50%  Fibonacci retracement , horizontal overlap resistance) where we expect price to fall further to its support at 6160 (61.8%  Fibonacci retracement , horizontal overlap support).  
Stochastic  (89, 5, 3) has reversed off its resistance where a corresponding drop is expected.

This is still the first peak on the 4H  RSI  since we've hit the ""very bottom."" Ideally it would go sideways overall, hit another valley in the short term, and consolidate before going up. Sometimes it can resist doing that, but the dump just now indicates otherwise. Nonetheless, I'm not buying until at least the 4H  RSI  hits 30. The 4H  RSI  hit 75 after that recent double pump and people were still chanting BUY BUY BUY before it dumped. I knew that was A BAD TIME TO BUY, SO I DIDN'T. I'VE BEEN HOLDING OFF SINCE I SOLD AT 455 ETH. I'm not buying until the  MACD  flips again, or  RSI  hits 30. It will go down quite a bit before either of those happen. There might be some minor bumps along the way, but I don't care, I'm a 1D/ 4H trader.

 BTC -0.71%  is doing what i thought it would do at this stage. I did not get carried away by the recent little run. Will test $6000 again. 
$6400 is the  support/resistance  level now for this  elliot wave  formation to continue to its targets. 
On a  daily timeframe  the  RSI  is over sold. 
3 day and weekly have a cross over and room to grow but whether the momentum can carry remains to be seen. 
Reality Check - Still didnt make a higher high, currently following the pattern of lower highs. Bottom line is $5800 so if a lower low comes we will then look at retesting $5000 with a  support/resistance  at $5300 
No-one really knows where the bottom is. My plan right now, avoid day trades and im not calling trade signals right now. Accumulating bigger top 10 coins at low red candles and being patient.

  The  TD 0.42%  counters show the weekly candle  has counted down 8 candles   and should hit a 9 the candle next week . 
I say *should* as  the  9th              candle  can be skipped and  BTC -0.71%  will starts a new count instead. 

Why this matters ?

In TomDeamark  counters a clean  1 to  9  candle countdown on a weekly candle   indicates upwards movement incoming after the   9th              candle. 
If   BTC -0.71%  does not hit that  9 candle, and instead moves upwards  then we know the reversal upwards is incomplete and we can expect  further downward movement

Hey everyone, I'm back! Welcome to yet another daily  BTC -0.71%  update. Let's get started. 

Today is Tuesday and we haven't since a slightest peak in  volume  meaning something is probably cooking with the big boys. At this point we know what direction the big boys are pushing the market; DOWN. Tomorrow and the day after are the biggest  volume  day of the week and I am fairly certain the bulltrap is coming to an end. The last few months have shown us that bulltraps usually only last a few days. For that reason I am expecting a drop very soon to a lower low (lower than 5800). If you are betting LONG then your stoploss should be tight because you might get REKT. 

I am short on right now and expecting a drop to the low 5k at the very least 

Who's Becky? What's her background? I am a crypto enthusiast and have been since early 2015. I have already made millions in the crypto world and am financially set for the rest of my life. I recently decided to start helping other people get rich. I like helping people, it makes me feel good. What can I say? I LOVE feeling good ;) . Let's share the journey together!

These past few days , alts have risen crazily with at least 50% gain. Some moved very early then stall at top , then some start rising .  
Before , I was very  bullish  to  bitcoin -0.71%  . However, after observing alts' behavior and bitcoin's pump style. I think this might just be a temporary relief and we will go to 5.2k zone 

Reason: 
-  Bitcoin -0.71%  's pump style is not healthy one. It is  bearish  barking style (not the normal healthy going up style). People will be either miss or hit with the pump 
- For alts, it looks like they are RUSHING to jump up. Yeah I use the word RUSH. Either people are in profit or they will be trapped for buying at top. This is not a typical healthy pump 

In conclusion, if we can't hold 6.3k-6.4k we  will head south which I think the chance for it is pretty high now. If we can hold, we will head north 
This is the time to stay in fiat , not to buy any coins 

P.S : my post is not financial advise.

This is still the first peak on the 4H  RSI  since we've hit the ""very bottom."" Ideally it would go sideways overall, hit another valley in the short term, and consolidate before going up. Sometimes it can resist doing that, but the dump just now indicates otherwise. Nonetheless, I'm not buying until at least the 4H  RSI  hits 30. The 4H  RSI  hit 75 after that recent double pump and people were still chanting BUY BUY BUY before it dumped. I knew that was A BAD TIME TO BUY, SO I DIDN'T. I'VE BEEN HOLDING OFF SINCE I SOLD AT 455 ETH. I'm not buying until the  MACD  flips again, or  RSI  hits 30. It will go down quite a bit before either of those happen. There might be some minor bumps along the way, but I don't care, I'm a 1D/ 4H trader.

 BTC -0.68%  is doing what i thought it would do at this stage. I did not get carried away by the recent little run. Will test $6000 again. 
$6400 is the  support/resistance  level now for this  elliot wave  formation to continue to its targets. 
On a  daily timeframe  the  RSI  is over sold. 
3 day and weekly have a cross over and room to grow but whether the momentum can carry remains to be seen. 
Reality Check - Still didnt make a higher high, currently following the pattern of lower highs. Bottom line is $5800 so if a lower low comes we will then look at retesting $5000 with a  support/resistance  at $5300 
No-one really knows where the bottom is. My plan right now, avoid day trades and im not calling trade signals right now. Accumulating bigger top 10 coins at low red candles and being patient.

  The  TD              counters show the weekly candle  has counted down 8 candles   and should hit a 9 the candle next week . 
I say *should* as  the  9th -4.01%  candle  can be skipped and  BTC -0.68%  will starts a new count instead. 

Why this matters ? 
==================== 
In TomDeamark  counters a clean  1 to  9  candle countdown on a weekly candle   indicates upwards movement incoming after the   9th -4.01%  candle. 
If   BTC -0.68%  does not hit that  9 candle, and instead moves upwards  then we know the reversal upwards is incomplete and we can expect  further downward movement

Hey everyone, I'm back! Welcome to yet another daily  BTC -0.68%  update. Let's get started. 

Today is Tuesday and we haven't since a slightest peak in  volume  meaning something is probably cooking with the big boys. At this point we know what direction the big boys are pushing the market; DOWN. Tomorrow and the day after are the biggest  volume  day of the week and I am fairly certain the bulltrap is coming to an end. The last few months have shown us that bulltraps usually only last a few days. For that reason I am expecting a drop very soon to a lower low (lower than 5800). If you are betting LONG then your stoploss should be tight because you might get REKT. 

I am short on right now and expecting a drop to the low 5k at the very least 

Who's Becky? What's her background? I am a crypto enthusiast and have been since early 2015. I have already made millions in the crypto world and am financially set for the rest of my life. I recently decided to start helping other people get rich. I like helping people, it makes me feel good. What can I say? I LOVE feeling good ;) . Let's share the journey together!

These past few days , alts have risen crazily with at least 50% gain. Some moved very early then stall at top , then some start rising .  
Before , I was very  bullish  to  bitcoin -0.68%  . However, after observing alts' behavior and bitcoin's pump style. I think this might just be a temporary relief and we will go to 5.2k zone 

Reason: 
-  Bitcoin -0.68%  's pump style is not healthy one. It is  bearish  barking style (not the normal healthy going up style). People will be either miss or hit with the pump 
- For alts, it looks like they are RUSHING to jump up. Yeah I use the word RUSH. Either people are in profit or they will be trapped for buying at top. This is not a typical healthy pump 

In conclusion, if we can't hold 6.3k-6.4k we  will head south which I think the chance for it is pretty high now. If we can hold, we will head north 
This is the time to stay in fiat , not to buy any coins 

P.S : my post is not financial advise.

This is still the first peak on the 4H  RSI  since we've hit the ""very bottom."" Ideally it would go sideways overall, hit another valley in the short term, and consolidate before going up.

 BTC -0.55%  is doing what i thought it would do at this stage. I did not get carried away by the recent little run. Will test $6000 again. 
$6400 is the  support/resistance  level now for this  elliot wave  formation to continue to its targets. 
On a  daily timeframe  the  RSI  is over sold. 
3 day and weekly have a cross over and room to grow but whether the momentum can carry remains to be seen. 
Reality Check - Still didnt make a higher high, currently following the pattern of lower highs. Bottom line is $5800 so if a lower low comes we will then look at retesting $5000 with a  support/resistance  at $5300 
No-one really knows where the bottom is. My plan right now, avoid day trades and im not calling trade signals right now. Accumulating bigger top 10 coins at low red candles and being patient.

  The  TD 0.42%  counters show the weekly candle  has counted down 8 candles   and should hit a 9 the candle next week . 
I say *should* as  the  9th -4.01%  candle  can be skipped and  BTC -0.55%  will starts a new count instead. 

Why this matters ?

In TomDeamark  counters a clean  1 to  9  candle countdown on a weekly candle   indicates upwards movement incoming after the   9th -4.01%  candle. 
If   BTC -0.55%  does not hit that  9 candle, and instead moves upwards  then we know the reversal upwards is incomplete and we can expect  further downward movement

Hey everyone, I'm back! Welcome to yet another daily  BTC -0.55%  update. Let's get started. 

Today is Tuesday and we haven't since a slightest peak in  volume  meaning something is probably cooking with the big boys. At this point we know what direction the big boys are pushing the market; DOWN. Tomorrow and the day after are the biggest  volume  day of the week and I am fairly certain the bulltrap is coming to an end. The last few months have shown us that bulltraps usually only last a few days. For that reason I am expecting a drop very soon to a lower low (lower than 5800). If you are betting LONG then your stoploss should be tight because you might get REKT. 

I am short on right now and expecting a drop to the low 5k at the very least 

Who's Becky? What's her background? I am a crypto enthusiast and have been since early 2015. I have already made millions in the crypto world and am financially set for the rest of my life. I recently decided to start helping other people get rich. I like helping people, it makes me feel good. What can I say? I LOVE feeling good ;) . Let's share the journey together!

These past few days , alts have risen crazily with at least 50% gain. Some moved very early then stall at top , then some start rising .  
Before , I was very  bullish  to  bitcoin -0.55%  . However, after observing alts' behavior and bitcoin's pump style. I think this might just be a temporary relief and we will go to 5.2k zone 

Reason: 
-  Bitcoin -0.55%  's pump style is not healthy one. It is  bearish  barking style (not the normal healthy going up style). People will be either miss or hit with the pump 
- For alts, it looks like they are RUSHING to jump up. Yeah I use the word RUSH. Either people are in profit or they will be trapped for buying at top. This is not a typical healthy pump 

In conclusion, if we can't hold 6.3k-6.4k we  will head south which I think the chance for it is pretty high now. If we can hold, we will head north 
This is the time to stay in fiat , not to buy any coins 

P.S : my post is not financial advise.

Sometimes it can resist doing that, but the dump just now indicates otherwise. Nonetheless, I'm not buying until at least the 4H  RSI  hits 30. The 4H  RSI  hit 75 after that recent double pump and people were still chanting BUY BUY BUY before it dumped. I knew that was A BAD TIME TO BUY, SO I DIDN'T. I'VE BEEN HOLDING OFF SINCE I SOLD AT 455 ETH. I'm not buying until the  MACD  flips again, or  RSI  hits 30. It will go down quite a bit before either of those happen.

 BTC -0.55%  is doing what i thought it would do at this stage. I did not get carried away by the recent little run. Will test $6000 again. 
$6400 is the  support/resistance  level now for this  elliot wave  formation to continue to its targets. 
On a  daily timeframe  the  RSI  is over sold. 
3 day and weekly have a cross over and room to grow but whether the momentum can carry remains to be seen. 
Reality Check - Still didnt make a higher high, currently following the pattern of lower highs. Bottom line is $5800 so if a lower low comes we will then look at retesting $5000 with a  support/resistance  at $5300 
No-one really knows where the bottom is. My plan right now, avoid day trades and im not calling trade signals right now. Accumulating bigger top 10 coins at low red candles and being patient.

  The  TD 0.42%  counters show the weekly candle  has counted down 8 candles   and should hit a 9 the candle next week . 
I say *should* as  the  9th -4.01%  candle  can be skipped and  BTC -0.55%  will starts a new count instead. 

Why this matters ?

In TomDeamark  counters a clean  1 to  9  candle countdown on a weekly candle   indicates upwards movement incoming after the   9th -4.01%  candle. 
If   BTC -0.55%  does not hit that  9 candle, and instead moves upwards  then we know the reversal upwards is incomplete and we can expect  further downward movement

Hey everyone, I'm back! Welcome to yet another daily  BTC -0.55%  update. Let's get started. 

Today is Tuesday and we haven't since a slightest peak in  volume  meaning something is probably cooking with the big boys. At this point we know what direction the big boys are pushing the market; DOWN. Tomorrow and the day after are the biggest  volume  day of the week and I am fairly certain the bulltrap is coming to an end. The last few months have shown us that bulltraps usually only last a few days. For that reason I am expecting a drop very soon to a lower low (lower than 5800). If you are betting LONG then your stoploss should be tight because you might get REKT. 

I am short on right now and expecting a drop to the low 5k at the very least 

Who's Becky? What's her background? I am a crypto enthusiast and have been since early 2015. I have already made millions in the crypto world and am financially set for the rest of my life. I recently decided to start helping other people get rich. I like helping people, it makes me feel good. What can I say? I LOVE feeling good ;) . Let's share the journey together!

These past few days , alts have risen crazily with at least 50% gain. Some moved very early then stall at top , then some start rising .  
Before , I was very  bullish  to  bitcoin -0.55%  . However, after observing alts' behavior and bitcoin's pump style. I think this might just be a temporary relief and we will go to 5.2k zone 

Reason: 
-  Bitcoin -0.55%  's pump style is not healthy one. It is  bearish  barking style (not the normal healthy going up style). People will be either miss or hit with the pump 
- For alts, it looks like they are RUSHING to jump up. Yeah I use the word RUSH. Either people are in profit or they will be trapped for buying at top. This is not a typical healthy pump 

In conclusion, if we can't hold 6.3k-6.4k we  will head south which I think the chance for it is pretty high now. If we can hold, we will head north 
This is the time to stay in fiat , not to buy any coins 

P.S : my post is not financial advise.

 BTC -0.64%  is doing what i thought it would do at this stage. I did not get carried away by the recent little run. Will test $6000 again. 
$6400 is the  support/resistance  level now for this  elliot wave  formation to continue to its targets. 
On a  daily timeframe  the  RSI  is over sold. 
3 day and weekly have a cross over and room to grow but whether the momentum can carry remains to be seen. 
Reality Check - Still didnt make a higher high, currently following the pattern of lower highs. Bottom line is $5800 so if a lower low comes we will then look at retesting $5000 with a  support/resistance  at $5300 
No-one really knows where the bottom is. My plan right now, avoid day trades and im not calling trade signals right now. Accumulating bigger top 10 coins at low red candles and being patient.

  The  TD              counters show the weekly candle  has counted down 8 candles   and should hit a 9 the candle next week . 
I say *should* as  the  9th -4.01%  candle  can be skipped and  BTC -0.64%  will starts a new count instead. 

Why this matters ? 
==================== 
In TomDeamark  counters a clean  1 to  9  candle countdown on a weekly candle   indicates upwards movement incoming after the   9th -4.01%  candle. 
If   BTC -0.64%  does not hit that  9 candle, and instead moves upwards  then we know the reversal upwards is incomplete and we can expect  further downward movement

Hey everyone, I'm back! Welcome to yet another daily  BTC -0.64%  update. Let's get started. 

Today is Tuesday and we haven't since a slightest peak in  volume  meaning something is probably cooking with the big boys. At this point we know what direction the big boys are pushing the market; DOWN. Tomorrow and the day after are the biggest  volume  day of the week and I am fairly certain the bulltrap is coming to an end. The last few months have shown us that bulltraps usually only last a few days. For that reason I am expecting a drop very soon to a lower low (lower than 5800). If you are betting LONG then your stoploss should be tight because you might get REKT. 

I am short on right now and expecting a drop to the low 5k at the very least 

Who's Becky? What's her background? I am a crypto enthusiast and have been since early 2015. I have already made millions in the crypto world and am financially set for the rest of my life. I recently decided to start helping other people get rich. I like helping people, it makes me feel good. What can I say? I LOVE feeling good ;) . Let's share the journey together!

These past few days , alts have risen crazily with at least 50% gain. Some moved very early then stall at top , then some start rising .  
Before , I was very  bullish  to  bitcoin -0.64%  . However, after observing alts' behavior and bitcoin's pump style. I think this might just be a temporary relief and we will go to 5.2k zone 

Reason: 
-  Bitcoin -0.64%  's pump style is not healthy one. It is  bearish  barking style (not the normal healthy going up style). People will be either miss or hit with the pump 
- For alts, it looks like they are RUSHING to jump up. Yeah I use the word RUSH. Either people are in profit or they will be trapped for buying at top. This is not a typical healthy pump 

In conclusion, if we can't hold 6.3k-6.4k we  will head south which I think the chance for it is pretty high now. If we can hold, we will head north 
This is the time to stay in fiat , not to buy any coins 

P.S : my post is not financial advise.

 BTC -0.67%  is doing what i thought it would do at this stage. I did not get carried away by the recent little run. Will test $6000 again. 
$6400 is the  support/resistance  level now for this  elliot wave  formation to continue to its targets. 
On a  daily timeframe  the  RSI  is over sold. 
3 day and weekly have a cross over and room to grow but whether the momentum can carry remains to be seen. 
Reality Check - Still didnt make a higher high, currently following the pattern of lower highs. Bottom line is $5800 so if a lower low comes we will then look at retesting $5000 with a  support/resistance  at $5300 
No-one really knows where the bottom is. My plan right now, avoid day trades and im not calling trade signals right now. Accumulating bigger top 10 coins at low red candles and being patient.

  The  TD              counters show the weekly candle  has counted down 8 candles   and should hit a 9 the candle next week . 
I say *should* as  the  9th -4.01%  candle  can be skipped and  BTC -0.67%  will starts a new count instead. 

Why this matters ? 
==================== 
In TomDeamark  counters a clean  1 to  9  candle countdown on a weekly candle   indicates upwards movement incoming after the   9th -4.01%  candle. 
If   BTC -0.67%  does not hit that  9 candle, and instead moves upwards  then we know the reversal upwards is incomplete and we can expect  further downward movement

Hey everyone, I'm back! Welcome to yet another daily  BTC -0.63%  update. Let's get started. 

Today is Tuesday and we haven't since a slightest peak in  volume  meaning something is probably cooking with the big boys. At this point we know what direction the big boys are pushing the market; DOWN. Tomorrow and the day after are the biggest  volume  day of the week and I am fairly certain the bulltrap is coming to an end. The last few months have shown us that bulltraps usually only last a few days. For that reason I am expecting a drop very soon to a lower low (lower than 5800). If you are betting LONG then your stoploss should be tight because you might get REKT. 

I am short on right now and expecting a drop to the low 5k at the very least 

Who's Becky? What's her background? I am a crypto enthusiast and have been since early 2015. I have already made millions in the crypto world and am financially set for the rest of my life. I recently decided to start helping other people get rich. I like helping people, it makes me feel good. What can I say? I LOVE feeling good ;) . Let's share the journey together!

These past few days , alts have risen crazily with at least 50% gain. Some moved very early then stall at top , then some start rising .  
Before , I was very  bullish  to  bitcoin              . However, after observing alts' behavior and bitcoin's pump style. I think this might just be a temporary relief and we will go to 5.2k zone 

Reason: 
-  Bitcoin              's pump style is not healthy one. It is  bearish  barking style (not the normal healthy going up style). People will be either miss or hit with the pump 
- For alts, it looks like they are RUSHING to jump up. Yeah I use the word RUSH. Either people are in profit or they will be trapped for buying at top. This is not a typical healthy pump 

In conclusion, if we can't hold 6.3k-6.4k we  will head south which I think the chance for it is pretty high now. If we can hold, we will head north 
This is the time to stay in fiat , not to buy any coins 

P.S : my post is not financial advise.

 BTC -0.51%  is doing what i thought it would do at this stage. I did not get carried away by the recent little run. Will test $6000 again. 
$6400 is the  support/resistance  level now for this  elliot wave  formation to continue to its targets. 
On a  daily timeframe  the  RSI  is over sold. 
3 day and weekly have a cross over and room to grow but whether the momentum can carry remains to be seen. 
Reality Check - Still didnt make a higher high, currently following the pattern of lower highs. Bottom line is $5800 so if a lower low comes we will then look at retesting $5000 with a  support/resistance  at $5300 
No-one really knows where the bottom is. My plan right now, avoid day trades and im not calling trade signals right now. Accumulating bigger top 10 coins at low red candles and being patient.

  The  TD 0.42%  counters show the weekly candle  has counted down 8 candles   and should hit a 9 the candle next week . 
I say *should* as  the  9th -4.01%  candle  can be skipped and  BTC -0.51%  will starts a new count instead. 

Why this matters ?

In TomDeamark  counters a clean  1 to  9  candle countdown on a weekly candle   indicates upwards movement incoming after the   9th -4.01%  candle. 
If   BTC -0.51%  does not hit that  9 candle, and instead moves upwards  then we know the reversal upwards is incomplete and we can expect  further downward movement

Hey everyone, I'm back! Welcome to yet another daily  BTC -0.44%  update. Let's get started. 

Today is Tuesday and we haven't since a slightest peak in  volume  meaning something is probably cooking with the big boys. At this point we know what direction the big boys are pushing the market; DOWN. Tomorrow and the day after are the biggest  volume  day of the week and I am fairly certain the bulltrap is coming to an end. The last few months have shown us that bulltraps usually only last a few days. For that reason I am expecting a drop very soon to a lower low (lower than 5800). If you are betting LONG then your stoploss should be tight because you might get REKT. 

I am short on right now and expecting a drop to the low 5k at the very least 

Who's Becky? What's her background? I am a crypto enthusiast and have been since early 2015. I have already made millions in the crypto world and am financially set for the rest of my life. I recently decided to start helping other people get rich. I like helping people, it makes me feel good. What can I say? I LOVE feeling good ;) . Let's share the journey together!

These past few days , alts have risen crazily with at least 50% gain. Some moved very early then stall at top , then some start rising .  
Before , I was very  bullish  to  bitcoin -0.44%  . However, after observing alts' behavior and bitcoin's pump style. I think this might just be a temporary relief and we will go to 5.2k zone 

Reason: 
-  Bitcoin -0.44%  's pump style is not healthy one. It is  bearish  barking style (not the normal healthy going up style). People will be either miss or hit with the pump 
- For alts, it looks like they are RUSHING to jump up. Yeah I use the word RUSH. Either people are in profit or they will be trapped for buying at top. This is not a typical healthy pump 

In conclusion, if we can't hold 6.3k-6.4k we  will head south which I think the chance for it is pretty high now. If we can hold, we will head north 
This is the time to stay in fiat , not to buy any coins 

P.S : my post is not financial advise.

 BTC -0.49%  is doing what i thought it would do at this stage. I did not get carried away by the recent little run. Will test $6000 again. 
$6400 is the  support/resistance  level now for this  elliot wave  formation to continue to its targets. 
On a  daily timeframe  the  RSI  is over sold. 
3 day and weekly have a cross over and room to grow but whether the momentum can carry remains to be seen. 
Reality Check - Still didnt make a higher high, currently following the pattern of lower highs. Bottom line is $5800 so if a lower low comes we will then look at retesting $5000 with a  support/resistance  at $5300 
No-one really knows where the bottom is. My plan right now, avoid day trades and im not calling trade signals right now. Accumulating bigger top 10 coins at low red candles and being patient.

  The  TD              counters show the weekly candle  has counted down 8 candles   and should hit a 9 the candle next week . 
I say *should* as  the  9th -4.01%  candle  can be skipped and  BTC -0.49%  will starts a new count instead. 

Why this matters ? 
==================== 
In TomDeamark  counters a clean  1 to  9  candle countdown on a weekly candle   indicates upwards movement incoming after the   9th -4.01%  candle. 
If   BTC -0.49%  does not hit that  9 candle, and instead moves upwards  then we know the reversal upwards is incomplete and we can expect  further downward movement 
at a later time.

Hey everyone, I'm back! Welcome to yet another daily  BTC -0.52%  update. Let's get started. 

Today is Tuesday and we haven't since a slightest peak in  volume  meaning something is probably cooking with the big boys. At this point we know what direction the big boys are pushing the market; DOWN. Tomorrow and the day after are the biggest  volume  day of the week and I am fairly certain the bulltrap is coming to an end. The last few months have shown us that bulltraps usually only last a few days. For that reason I am expecting a drop very soon to a lower low (lower than 5800). If you are betting LONG then your stoploss should be tight because you might get REKT. 

I am short on right now and expecting a drop to the low 5k at the very least 

Who's Becky? What's her background? I am a crypto enthusiast and have been since early 2015. I have already made millions in the crypto world and am financially set for the rest of my life. I recently decided to start helping other people get rich. I like helping people, it makes me feel good. What can I say? I LOVE feeling good ;) . Let's share the journey together!

These past few days , alts have risen crazily with at least 50% gain. Some moved very early then stall at top , then some start rising .  
Before , I was very  bullish  to  bitcoin -0.52%  . However, after observing alts' behavior and bitcoin's pump style. I think this might just be a temporary relief and we will go to 5.2k zone 

Reason: 
-  Bitcoin -0.52%  's pump style is not healthy one. It is  bearish  barking style (not the normal healthy going up style). People will be either miss or hit with the pump 
- For alts, it looks like they are RUSHING to jump up. Yeah I use the word RUSH. Either people are in profit or they will be trapped for buying at top. This is not a typical healthy pump 

In conclusion, if we can't hold 6.3k-6.4k we  will head south which I think the chance for it is pretty high now. If we can hold, we will head north 
This is the time to stay in fiat , not to buy any coins 

P.S : my post is not financial advise.

This is still the first peak on the 4H  RSI  since we've hit the ""very bottom."" Ideally it would go sideways overall, hit another valley in the short term, and consolidate before going up. Sometimes it can resist doing that, but the dump just now indicates otherwise. Nonetheless, I'm not buying until at least the 4H  RSI  hits 30. The 4H  RSI  hit 75 after that recent double pump and people were still chanting BUY BUY BUY before it dumped. I knew that was A BAD TIME TO BUY, SO I DIDN'T. I'VE BEEN HOLDING OFF SINCE I SOLD AT 455 ETH. I'm not buying until the  MACD  flips again, or  RSI  hits 30. It will go down quite a bit before either of those happen. There might be some minor bumps along the way, but I don't care, I'm a 1D/ 4H trader.

 BTC              is doing what i thought it would do at this stage. I did not get carried away by the recent little run. Will test $6000 again. 
$6400 is the  support/resistance  level now for this  elliot wave  formation to continue to its targets. 
On a  daily timeframe  the  RSI  is over sold. 
3 day and weekly have a cross over and room to grow but whether the momentum can carry remains to be seen. 
Reality Check - Still didnt make a higher high, currently following the pattern of lower highs. Bottom line is $5800 so if a lower low comes we will then look at retesting $5000 with a  support/resistance  at $5300 
No-one really knows where the bottom is. My plan right now, avoid day trades and im not calling trade signals right now. Accumulating bigger top 10 coins at low red candles and being patient. 
BTC              Sub 6k and down.. accumulate and hold a paper loss if you need to

  The  TD              counters show the weekly candle  has counted down 8 candles   and should hit a 9 the candle next week . 
I say *should* as  the  9th              candle  can be skipped and  BTC              will starts a new count instead. 

Why this matters ? 
==================== 
In TomDeamark  counters a clean  1 to  9  candle countdown on a weekly candle   indicates upwards movement incoming after the   9th              candle. 
If   BTC              does not hit that  9 candle, and instead moves upwards  then we know the reversal upwards is incomplete and we can expect  further downward movement 
at a later time.

Hey everyone, I'm back! Welcome to yet another daily  BTC              update. Let's get started. 

Today is Tuesday and we haven't since a slightest peak in  volume  meaning something is probably cooking with the big boys. At this point we know what direction the big boys are pushing the market; DOWN. Tomorrow and the day after are the biggest  volume  day of the week and I am fairly certain the bulltrap is coming to an end. The last few months have shown us that bulltraps usually only last a few days. For that reason I am expecting a drop very soon to a lower low (lower than 5800). If you are betting LONG then your stoploss should be tight because you might get REKT. 

I am short on right now and expecting a drop to the low 5k at the very least 

Who's Becky? What's her background? I am a crypto enthusiast and have been since early 2015. I have already made millions in the crypto world and am financially set for the rest of my life. I recently decided to start helping other people get rich. I like helping people, it makes me feel good. What can I say? I LOVE feeling good ;) . Let's share the journey together!

These past few days , alts have risen crazily with at least 50% gain. Some moved very early then stall at top , then some start rising .  
Before , I was very  bullish  to  bitcoin -0.44%  . However, after observing alts' behavior and bitcoin's pump style. I think this might just be a temporary relief and we will go to 5.2k zone 

Reason: 
-  Bitcoin -0.44%  's pump style is not healthy one. It is  bearish  barking style (not the normal healthy going up style). People will be either miss or hit with the pump 
- For alts, it looks like they are RUSHING to jump up. Yeah I use the word RUSH. Either people are in profit or they will be trapped for buying at top. This is not a typical healthy pump 

In conclusion, if we can't hold 6.3k-6.4k we  will head south which I think the chance for it is pretty high now. If we can hold, we will head north 
This is the time to stay in fiat , not to buy any coins 

P.S : my post is not financial advise.

This is still the first peak on the 4H  RSI  since we've hit the ""very bottom."" Ideally it would go sideways overall, hit another valley in the short term, and consolidate before going up. Sometimes it can resist doing that, but the dump just now indicates otherwise. Nonetheless, I'm not buying until at least the 4H  RSI  hits 30. The 4H  RSI  hit 75 after that recent double pump and people were still chanting BUY BUY BUY before it dumped. I knew that was A BAD TIME TO BUY, SO I DIDN'T. I'VE BEEN HOLDING OFF SINCE I SOLD AT 455 ETH. I'm not buying until the  MACD  flips again, or  RSI  hits 30. It will go down quite a bit before either of those happen. There might be some minor bumps along the way, but I don't care, I'm a 1D/ 4H trader.

  The  TD              counters show the weekly candle  has counted down 8 candles   and should hit a 9 the candle next week . 
I say *should* as  the  9th              candle  can be skipped and  BTC              will starts a new count instead. 

Why this matters ? 
==================== 
In TomDeamark  counters a clean  1 to  9  candle countdown on a weekly candle   indicates upwards movement incoming after the   9th              candle. 
If   BTC              does not hit that  9 candle, and instead moves upwards  then we know the reversal upwards is incomplete and we can expect  further downward movement

Hey everyone, I'm back! Welcome to yet another daily  BTC              update. Let's get started. 

Today is Tuesday and we haven't since a slightest peak in  volume  meaning something is probably cooking with the big boys. At this point we know what direction the big boys are pushing the market; DOWN. Tomorrow and the day after are the biggest  volume  day of the week and I am fairly certain the bulltrap is coming to an end. The last few months have shown us that bulltraps usually only last a few days. For that reason I am expecting a drop very soon to a lower low (lower than 5800). If you are betting LONG then your stoploss should be tight because you might get REKT. 

I am short on right now and expecting a drop to the low 5k at the very least 

Who's Becky? What's her background? I am a crypto enthusiast and have been since early 2015. I have already made millions in the crypto world and am financially set for the rest of my life. I recently decided to start helping other people get rich. I like helping people, it makes me feel good. What can I say? I LOVE feeling good ;) . Let's share the journey together!

These past few days , alts have risen crazily with at least 50% gain. Some moved very early then stall at top , then some start rising .  
Before , I was very  bullish  to  bitcoin -0.40%  . However, after observing alts' behavior and bitcoin's pump style. I think this might just be a temporary relief and we will go to 5.2k zone 

Reason: 
-  Bitcoin -0.40%  's pump style is not healthy one. It is  bearish  barking style (not the normal healthy going up style). People will be either miss or hit with the pump 
- For alts, it looks like they are RUSHING to jump up. Yeah I use the word RUSH. Either people are in profit or they will be trapped for buying at top. This is not a typical healthy pump 

In conclusion, if we can't hold 6.3k-6.4k we  will head south which I think the chance for it is pretty high now. If we can hold, we will head north 
This is the time to stay in fiat , not to buy any coins 

P.S : my post is not financial advise.

This is still the first peak on the 4H  RSI  since we've hit the ""very bottom."" Ideally it would go sideways overall, hit another valley in the short term, and consolidate before going up. Sometimes it can resist doing that, but the dump just now indicates otherwise. Nonetheless, I'm not buying until at least the 4H  RSI  hits 30. The 4H  RSI  hit 75 after that recent double pump and people were still chanting BUY BUY BUY before it dumped. I knew that was A BAD TIME TO BUY, SO I DIDN'T. I'VE BEEN HOLDING OFF SINCE I SOLD AT 455 ETH. I'm not buying until the  MACD  flips again, or  RSI  hits 30. It will go down quite a bit before either of those happen.

  The  TD              counters show the weekly candle  has counted down 8 candles   and should hit a 9 the candle next week . 
I say *should* as  the  9th              candle  can be skipped and  BTC              will starts a new count instead. 

Why this matters ? 
==================== 
In TomDeamark  counters a clean  1 to  9  candle countdown on a weekly candle   indicates upwards movement incoming after the   9th              candle. 
If   BTC              does not hit that  9 candle, and instead moves upwards  then we know the reversal upwards is incomplete and we can expect  further downward movement 
at a later time.

Hey everyone, I'm back! Welcome to yet another daily  BTC -0.39%  update. Let's get started. 

Today is Tuesday and we haven't since a slightest peak in  volume  meaning something is probably cooking with the big boys. At this point we know what direction the big boys are pushing the market; DOWN. Tomorrow and the day after are the biggest  volume  day of the week and I am fairly certain the bulltrap is coming to an end. The last few months have shown us that bulltraps usually only last a few days. For that reason I am expecting a drop very soon to a lower low (lower than 5800). If you are betting LONG then your stoploss should be tight because you might get REKT. 

I am short on right now and expecting a drop to the low 5k at the very least 

Who's Becky? What's her background? I am a crypto enthusiast and have been since early 2015. I have already made millions in the crypto world and am financially set for the rest of my life. I recently decided to start helping other people get rich. I like helping people, it makes me feel good. What can I say? I LOVE feeling good ;) . Let's share the journey together!

These past few days , alts have risen crazily with at least 50% gain. Some moved very early then stall at top , then some start rising .  
Before , I was very  bullish  to  bitcoin -0.39%  . However, after observing alts' behavior and bitcoin's pump style. I think this might just be a temporary relief and we will go to 5.2k zone 

Reason: 
-  Bitcoin -0.39%  's pump style is not healthy one. It is  bearish  barking style (not the normal healthy going up style). People will be either miss or hit with the pump 
- For alts, it looks like they are RUSHING to jump up. Yeah I use the word RUSH. Either people are in profit or they will be trapped for buying at top. This is not a typical healthy pump 

In conclusion, if we can't hold 6.3k-6.4k we  will head south which I think the chance for it is pretty high now. If we can hold, we will head north 
This is the time to stay in fiat , not to buy any coins 

P.S : my post is not financial advise.

This is still the first peak on the 4H  RSI  since we've hit the ""very bottom."" Ideally it would go sideways overall, hit another valley in the short term, and consolidate before going up. Sometimes it can resist doing that, but the dump just now indicates otherwise. Nonetheless, I'm not buying until at least the 4H  RSI  hits 30. The 4H  RSI  hit 75 after that recent double pump and people were still chanting BUY BUY BUY before it dumped. I knew that was A BAD TIME TO BUY, SO I DIDN'T. I'VE BEEN HOLDING OFF SINCE I SOLD AT 455 ETH. I'm not buying until the  MACD  flips again, or  RSI  hits 30. It will go down quite a bit before either of those happen. There might be some minor bumps along the way, but I don't care, I'm a 1D/ 4H trader.

  The  TD 0.42%  counters show the weekly candle  has counted down 8 candles   and should hit a 9 the candle next week . 
I say *should* as  the  9th              candle  can be skipped and  BTC -0.45%  will starts a new count instead. 

Why this matters ? 
==================== 
In TomDeamark  counters a clean  1 to  9  candle countdown on a weekly candle   indicates upwards movement incoming after the   9th              candle. 
If   BTC -0.45%  does not hit that  9 candle, and instead moves upwards  then we know the reversal upwards is incomplete and we can expect  further downward movement 
at a later time.

Hey everyone, I'm back! Welcome to yet another daily  BTC -0.45%  update. Let's get started. 

Today is Tuesday and we haven't since a slightest peak in  volume  meaning something is probably cooking with the big boys. At this point we know what direction the big boys are pushing the market; DOWN. Tomorrow and the day after are the biggest  volume  day of the week and I am fairly certain the bulltrap is coming to an end. The last few months have shown us that bulltraps usually only last a few days. For that reason I am expecting a drop very soon to a lower low (lower than 5800). If you are betting LONG then your stoploss should be tight because you might get REKT. 

I am short on right now and expecting a drop to the low 5k at the very least 

Who's Becky? What's her background? I am a crypto enthusiast and have been since early 2015. I have already made millions in the crypto world and am financially set for the rest of my life. I recently decided to start helping other people get rich. I like helping people, it makes me feel good. What can I say? I LOVE feeling good ;) . Let's share the journey together!

These past few days , alts have risen crazily with at least 50% gain. Some moved very early then stall at top , then some start rising .  
Before , I was very  bullish  to  bitcoin -0.45%  . However, after observing alts' behavior and bitcoin's pump style. I think this might just be a temporary relief and we will go to 5.2k zone 

Reason: 
-  Bitcoin -0.45%  's pump style is not healthy one. It is  bearish  barking style (not the normal healthy going up style). People will be either miss or hit with the pump 
- For alts, it looks like they are RUSHING to jump up. Yeah I use the word RUSH. Either people are in profit or they will be trapped for buying at top. This is not a typical healthy pump 

In conclusion, if we can't hold 6.3k-6.4k we  will head south which I think the chance for it is pretty high now. If we can hold, we will head north 
This is the time to stay in fiat , not to buy any coins 

P.S : my post is not financial advise.

This is still the first peak on the 4H  RSI  since we've hit the ""very bottom."" Ideally it would go sideways overall, hit another valley in the short term, and consolidate before going up. Sometimes it can resist doing that, but the dump just now indicates otherwise. Nonetheless, I'm not buying until at least the 4H  RSI  hits 30. The 4H  RSI  hit 75 after that recent double pump and people were still chanting BUY BUY BUY before it dumped. I knew that was A BAD TIME TO BUY, SO I DIDN'T. I'VE BEEN HOLDING OFF SINCE I SOLD AT 455 ETH. I'm not buying until the  MACD  flips again, or  RSI  hits 30. It will go down quite a bit before either of those happen. There might be some minor bumps along the way, but I don't care, I'm a 1D/ 4H trader.

  The  TD              counters show the weekly candle  has counted down 8 candles   and should hit a 9 the candle next week . 
I say *should* as  the  9th              candle  can be skipped and  BTC              will starts a new count instead. 

Why this matters ? 
==================== 
In TomDeamark  counters a clean  1 to  9  candle countdown on a weekly candle   indicates upwards movement incoming after the   9th              candle. 
If   BTC              does not hit that  9 candle, and instead moves upwards  then we know the reversal upwards is incomplete and we can expect  further downward movement 
at a later time.

Hey everyone, I'm back! Welcome to yet another daily  BTC              update. Let's get started. 

Today is Tuesday and we haven't since a slightest peak in  volume  meaning something is probably cooking with the big boys. At this point we know what direction the big boys are pushing the market; DOWN. Tomorrow and the day after are the biggest  volume  day of the week and I am fairly certain the bulltrap is coming to an end. The last few months have shown us that bulltraps usually only last a few days. For that reason I am expecting a drop very soon to a lower low (lower than 5800). If you are betting LONG then your stoploss should be tight because you might get REKT. 

I am short on right now and expecting a drop to the low 5k at the very least 

Who's Becky? What's her background? I am a crypto enthusiast and have been since early 2015. I have already made millions in the crypto world and am financially set for the rest of my life. I recently decided to start helping other people get rich. I like helping people, it makes me feel good. What can I say? I LOVE feeling good ;) . Let's share the journey together!

These past few days , alts have risen crazily with at least 50% gain. Some moved very early then stall at top , then some start rising .  
Before , I was very  bullish  to  bitcoin -0.47%  . However, after observing alts' behavior and bitcoin's pump style. I think this might just be a temporary relief and we will go to 5.2k zone 

Reason: 
-  Bitcoin -0.47%  's pump style is not healthy one. It is  bearish  barking style (not the normal healthy going up style). People will be either miss or hit with the pump 
- For alts, it looks like they are RUSHING to jump up. Yeah I use the word RUSH. Either people are in profit or they will be trapped for buying at top. This is not a typical healthy pump 

In conclusion, if we can't hold 6.3k-6.4k we  will head south which I think the chance for it is pretty high now. If we can hold, we will head north 
This is the time to stay in fiat , not to buy any coins 

P.S : my post is not financial advise.

This is still the first peak on the 4H  RSI  since we've hit the ""very bottom."" Ideally it would go sideways overall, hit another valley in the short term, and consolidate before going up. Sometimes it can resist doing that, but the dump just now indicates otherwise. Nonetheless, I'm not buying until at least the 4H  RSI  hits 30. The 4H  RSI  hit 75 after that recent double pump and people were still chanting BUY BUY BUY before it dumped. I knew that was A BAD TIME TO BUY, SO I DIDN'T. I'VE BEEN HOLDING OFF SINCE I SOLD AT 455 ETH. I'm not buying until the  MACD  flips again, or  RSI  hits 30. It will go down quite a bit before either of those happen. There might be some minor bumps along the way, but I don't care, I'm a 1D/ 4H trader.

 BTC -0.51%  is doing what i thought it would do at this stage. I did not get carried away by the recent little run. Will test $6000 again. 
$6400 is the  support/resistance  level now for this  elliot wave  formation to continue to its targets. 
On a  daily timeframe  the  RSI  is over sold. 
3 day and weekly have a cross over and room to grow but whether the momentum can carry remains to be seen.

No-one really knows where the bottom is. My plan right now, avoid day trades and im not calling trade signals right now. Accumulating bigger top 10 coins at low red candles and being patient.

  The  TD              counters show the weekly candle  has counted down 8 candles   and should hit a 9 the candle next week . 
I say *should* as  the  9th -4.01%  candle  can be skipped and  BTC -0.51%  will starts a new count instead. 

Why this matters ? 
==================== 
In TomDeamark  counters a clean  1 to  9  candle countdown on a weekly candle   indicates upwards movement incoming after the   9th -4.01%  candle. 
If   BTC -0.51%  does not hit that  9 candle, and instead moves upwards  then we know the reversal upwards is incomplete and we can expect  further downward movement 
at a later time.

Hey everyone, I'm back! Welcome to yet another daily  BTC -0.51%  update. Let's get started. 

Today is Tuesday and we haven't since a slightest peak in  volume  meaning something is probably cooking with the big boys. At this point we know what direction the big boys are pushing the market; DOWN. Tomorrow and the day after are the biggest  volume  day of the week and I am fairly certain the bulltrap is coming to an end. The last few months have shown us that bulltraps usually only last a few days. For that reason I am expecting a drop very soon to a lower low (lower than 5800). If you are betting LONG then your stoploss should be tight because you might get REKT. 

I am short on right now and expecting a drop to the low 5k at the very least 

Who's Becky? What's her background? I am a crypto enthusiast and have been since early 2015. I have already made millions in the crypto world and am financially set for the rest of my life. I recently decided to start helping other people get rich. I like helping people, it makes me feel good. What can I say? I LOVE feeling good ;) . Let's share the journey together!

These past few days , alts have risen crazily with at least 50% gain. Some moved very early then stall at top , then some start rising .  
Before , I was very  bullish  to  bitcoin -0.51%  . However, after observing alts' behavior and bitcoin's pump style. I think this might just be a temporary relief and we will go to 5.2k zone 

Reason: 
-  Bitcoin -0.51%  's pump style is not healthy one. It is  bearish  barking style (not the normal healthy going up style). People will be either miss or hit with the pump 
- For alts, it looks like they are RUSHING to jump up. Yeah I use the word RUSH. Either people are in profit or they will be trapped for buying at top. This is not a typical healthy pump 

In conclusion, if we can't hold 6.3k-6.4k we  will head south which I think the chance for it is pretty high now. If we can hold, we will head north 
This is the time to stay in fiat , not to buy any coins 

P.S : my post is not financial advise.

This is still the first peak on the 4H  RSI  since we've hit the ""very bottom."" Ideally it would go sideways overall, hit another valley in the short term, and consolidate before going up. Sometimes it can resist doing that, but the dump just now indicates otherwise. Nonetheless, I'm not buying until at least the 4H  RSI  hits 30. The 4H  RSI  hit 75 after that recent double pump and people were still chanting BUY BUY BUY before it dumped. I knew that was A BAD TIME TO BUY, SO I DIDN'T. I'VE BEEN HOLDING OFF SINCE I SOLD AT 455 ETH. I'm not buying until the  MACD  flips again, or  RSI  hits 30. It will go down quite a bit before either of those happen. There might be some minor bumps along the way, but I don't care, I'm a 1D/ 4H trader.

 BTC -0.51%  is doing what i thought it would do at this stage. I did not get carried away by the recent little run. Will test $6000 again. 
$6400 is the  support/resistance  level now for this  elliot wave  formation to continue to its targets. 
On a  daily timeframe  the  RSI  is over sold. 
3 day and weekly have a cross over and room to grow but whether the momentum can carry remains to be seen. 
Reality Check - Still didnt make a higher high, currently following the pattern of lower highs. Bottom line is $5800 so if a lower low comes we will then look at retesting $5000 with a  support/resistance  at $5300 
No-one really knows where the bottom is. My plan right now, avoid day trades and im not calling trade signals right now. Accumulating bigger top 10 coins at low red candles and being patient.

In TomDeamark  counters a clean  1 to  9  candle countdown on a weekly candle   indicates upwards movement incoming after the   9th              candle. 
If   BTC -0.51%  does not hit that  9 candle, and instead moves upwards  then we know the reversal upwards is incomplete and we can expect  further downward movement 
at a later time.

Hey everyone, I'm back! Welcome to yet another daily  BTC -0.51%  update. Let's get started. 

Today is Tuesday and we haven't since a slightest peak in  volume  meaning something is probably cooking with the big boys. At this point we know what direction the big boys are pushing the market; DOWN. Tomorrow and the day after are the biggest  volume  day of the week and I am fairly certain the bulltrap is coming to an end. The last few months have shown us that bulltraps usually only last a few days. For that reason I am expecting a drop very soon to a lower low (lower than 5800). If you are betting LONG then your stoploss should be tight because you might get REKT. 

I am short on right now and expecting a drop to the low 5k at the very least 

Who's Becky? What's her background? I am a crypto enthusiast and have been since early 2015. I have already made millions in the crypto world and am financially set for the rest of my life. I recently decided to start helping other people get rich. I like helping people, it makes me feel good. What can I say? I LOVE feeling good ;) . Let's share the journey together!

These past few days , alts have risen crazily with at least 50% gain. Some moved very early then stall at top , then some start rising .  
Before , I was very  bullish  to  bitcoin -0.51%  . However, after observing alts' behavior and bitcoin's pump style. I think this might just be a temporary relief and we will go to 5.2k zone 

Reason: 
-  Bitcoin -0.51%  's pump style is not healthy one. It is  bearish  barking style (not the normal healthy going up style). People will be either miss or hit with the pump 
- For alts, it looks like they are RUSHING to jump up. Yeah I use the word RUSH. Either people are in profit or they will be trapped for buying at top. This is not a typical healthy pump 

In conclusion, if we can't hold 6.3k-6.4k we  will head south which I think the chance for it is pretty high now. If we can hold, we will head north 
This is the time to stay in fiat , not to buy any coins 

P.S : my post is not financial advise.

This is still the first peak on the 4H  RSI  since we've hit the ""very bottom."" Ideally it would go sideways overall, hit another valley in the short term, and consolidate before going up. Sometimes it can resist doing that, but the dump just now indicates otherwise. Nonetheless, I'm not buying until at least the 4H  RSI  hits 30. The 4H  RSI  hit 75 after that recent double pump and people were still chanting BUY BUY BUY before it dumped. I knew that was A BAD TIME TO BUY, SO I DIDN'T. I'VE BEEN HOLDING OFF SINCE I SOLD AT 455 ETH. I'm not buying until the  MACD  flips again, or  RSI  hits 30. It will go down quite a bit before either of those happen. There might be some minor bumps along the way, but I don't care, I'm a 1D/ 4H trader.

 BTC -0.51%  is doing what i thought it would do at this stage. I did not get carried away by the recent little run. Will test $6000 again. 
$6400 is the  support/resistance  level now for this  elliot wave  formation to continue to its targets. 
On a  daily timeframe  the  RSI  is over sold. 
3 day and weekly have a cross over and room to grow but whether the momentum can carry remains to be seen. 
Reality Check - Still didnt make a higher high, currently following the pattern of lower highs. Bottom line is $5800 so if a lower low comes we will then look at retesting $5000 with a  support/resistance  at $5300 
No-one really knows where the bottom is. My plan right now, avoid day trades and im not calling trade signals right now. Accumulating bigger top 10 coins at low red candles and being patient.

Hey everyone, I'm back! Welcome to yet another daily  BTC              update. Let's get started. 

Today is Tuesday and we haven't since a slightest peak in  volume  meaning something is probably cooking with the big boys. At this point we know what direction the big boys are pushing the market; DOWN. Tomorrow and the day after are the biggest  volume  day of the week and I am fairly certain the bulltrap is coming to an end. The last few months have shown us that bulltraps usually only last a few days. For that reason I am expecting a drop very soon to a lower low (lower than 5800). If you are betting LONG then your stoploss should be tight because you might get REKT. 

I am short on right now and expecting a drop to the low 5k at the very least 

Who's Becky? What's her background? I am a crypto enthusiast and have been since early 2015. I have already made millions in the crypto world and am financially set for the rest of my life. I recently decided to start helping other people get rich. I like helping people, it makes me feel good. What can I say? I LOVE feeling good ;) . Let's share the journey together!

These past few days , alts have risen crazily with at least 50% gain. Some moved very early then stall at top , then some start rising .  
Before , I was very  bullish  to  bitcoin              . However, after observing alts' behavior and bitcoin's pump style. I think this might just be a temporary relief and we will go to 5.2k zone 

Reason: 
-  Bitcoin              's pump style is not healthy one. It is  bearish  barking style (not the normal healthy going up style). People will be either miss or hit with the pump 
- For alts, it looks like they are RUSHING to jump up. Yeah I use the word RUSH. Either people are in profit or they will be trapped for buying at top. This is not a typical healthy pump 

In conclusion, if we can't hold 6.3k-6.4k we  will head south which I think the chance for it is pretty high now. If we can hold, we will head north 
This is the time to stay in fiat , not to buy any coins 

P.S : my post is not financial advise.

This is still the first peak on the 4H  RSI  since we've hit the ""very bottom."" Ideally it would go sideways overall, hit another valley in the short term, and consolidate before going up. Sometimes it can resist doing that, but the dump just now indicates otherwise. Nonetheless, I'm not buying until at least the 4H  RSI  hits 30. The 4H  RSI  hit 75 after that recent double pump and people were still chanting BUY BUY BUY before it dumped. I knew that was A BAD TIME TO BUY, SO I DIDN'T. I'VE BEEN HOLDING OFF SINCE I SOLD AT 455 ETH. I'm not buying until the  MACD  flips again, or  RSI  hits 30. It will go down quite a bit before either of those happen. There might be some minor bumps along the way, but I don't care, I'm a 1D/ 4H trader.

 BTC -0.48%  is doing what i thought it would do at this stage. I did not get carried away by the recent little run. Will test $6000 again. 
$6400 is the  support/resistance  level now for this  elliot wave  formation to continue to its targets. 
On a  daily timeframe  the  RSI  is over sold. 
3 day and weekly have a cross over and room to grow but whether the momentum can carry remains to be seen. 
Reality Check - Still didnt make a higher high, currently following the pattern of lower highs. Bottom line is $5800 so if a lower low comes we will then look at retesting $5000 with a  support/resistance  at $5300 
No-one really knows where the bottom is. My plan right now, avoid day trades and im not calling trade signals right now. Accumulating bigger top 10 coins at low red candles and being patient.

Hey everyone, I'm back! Welcome to yet another daily  BTC              update. Let's get started. 

Today is Tuesday and we haven't since a slightest peak in  volume  meaning something is probably cooking with the big boys. At this point we know what direction the big boys are pushing the market; DOWN. Tomorrow and the day after are the biggest  volume  day of the week and I am fairly certain the bulltrap is coming to an end. The last few months have shown us that bulltraps usually only last a few days. For that reason I am expecting a drop very soon to a lower low (lower than 5800). If you are betting LONG then your stoploss should be tight because you might get REKT. 

I am short on right now and expecting a drop to the low 5k at the very least 

Who's Becky? What's her background? I am a crypto enthusiast and have been since early 2015. I have already made millions in the crypto world and am financially set for the rest of my life. I recently decided to start helping other people get rich. I like helping people, it makes me feel good. What can I say? I LOVE feeling good ;) . Let's share the journey together!

broke out of the down trend channel, so could move to test the conjunction of the 2  LT             trendlines  at 7600. I'll only long if it finds a shoulder pattern and breaks out.  

Now short from the  rising wedge  to the lows of the supposed left shoulder.

These past few days , alts have risen crazily with at least 50% gain. Some moved very early then stall at top , then some start rising .  
Before , I was very  bullish  to  bitcoin -0.51%  . However, after observing alts' behavior and bitcoin's pump style. I think this might just be a temporary relief and we will go to 5.2k zone 

Reason: 
-  Bitcoin -0.51%  's pump style is not healthy one. It is  bearish  barking style (not the normal healthy going up style). People will be either miss or hit with the pump 
- For alts, it looks like they are RUSHING to jump up. Yeah I use the word RUSH. Either people are in profit or they will be trapped for buying at top. This is not a typical healthy pump 

In conclusion, if we can't hold 6.3k-6.4k we  will head south which I think the chance for it is pretty high now. If we can hold, we will head north 
This is the time to stay in fiat , not to buy any coins 

P.S : my post is not financial advise.

Sell below 6666. Stop loss at 7014. Take profit at 6160. 
Reason for the trading strategy (technically): 
BTCUSD -0.51%  reversed off its resistance at 6666 (100% & 61.8%  Fibonacci extension , 50%  Fibonacci retracement , horizontal overlap resistance) where we expect price to fall further to its support at 6160 (61.8%  Fibonacci retracement , horizontal overlap support).  
Stochastic  (89, 5, 3) has reversed off its resistance where a corresponding drop is expected.

This is still the first peak on the 4H  RSI  since we've hit the ""very bottom."" Ideally it would go sideways overall, hit another valley in the short term, and consolidate before going up. Sometimes it can resist doing that, but the dump just now indicates otherwise. Nonetheless, I'm not buying until at least the 4H  RSI  hits 30. The 4H  RSI  hit 75 after that recent double pump and people were still chanting BUY BUY BUY before it dumped. I knew that was A BAD TIME TO BUY, SO I DIDN'T. I'VE BEEN HOLDING OFF SINCE I SOLD AT 455 ETH. I'm not buying until the  MACD  flips again, or  RSI  hits 30. It will go down quite a bit before either of those happen. There might be some minor bumps along the way, but I don't care, I'm a 1D/ 4H trader.

 BTC              is doing what i thought it would do at this stage. I did not get carried away by the recent little run. Will test $6000 again. 
$6400 is the  support/resistance  level now for this  elliot wave  formation to continue to its targets. 
On a  daily timeframe  the  RSI  is over sold. 
3 day and weekly have a cross over and room to grow but whether the momentum can carry remains to be seen. 
Reality Check - Still didnt make a higher high, currently following the pattern of lower highs. Bottom line is $5800 so if a lower low comes we will then look at retesting $5000 with a  support/resistance  at $5300 
No-one really knows where the bottom is. My plan right now, avoid day trades and im not calling trade signals right now. Accumulating bigger top 10 coins at low red candles and being patient. 
BTC              Sub 6k and down.. accumulate and hold a paper loss if you need to

  The  TD              counters show the weekly candle  has counted down 8 candles   and should hit a 9 the candle next week . 
I say *should* as  the  9th              candle  can be skipped and  BTC              will starts a new count instead. 

Why this matters ? 
==================== 
In TomDeamark  counters a clean  1 to  9  candle countdown on a weekly candle   indicates upwards movement incoming after the   9th              candle. 
If   BTC              does not hit that  9 candle, and instead moves upwards  then we know the reversal upwards is incomplete and we can expect  further downward movement 
at a later time.
