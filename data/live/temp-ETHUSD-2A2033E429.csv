1530137651.0,Jack777,ETH double bottom try,"
Hey guys, ETH is trying for a  double bottom  at the 420 area, I talked about this in today's episode of the Crypto Chart Analysis (description in my status). 4h EMAs 12 & 26 clearly act as resistance right now in ETH/USD, just like in the direct correlation of  ETH/BTC              => That means ETH is relatively weaker right now. So when playing ETH, always look at  ETH/BTC             , a move in  BTC              might be more leveraged with ETH, depending on the direct correlation. 

This is still highly  bearish  terrain: In order for the bulls to change the trend, we definitely have to get above the 12 & 26 EMAs, on the Daily break the Lower Highs around 480 Dollars & essentially 550 -otherwise the bulls haven't proven anything to us.

1530125354.0,MarcPMarkets,ETHUSD:  Bottoming Formation Materialzing Around 423 Level.,"
 ETHUSD -0.71%  update: Similar to the bottoming pattern in  BTC 0.04% , this market is now in a high probability area to retrace. What makes this market even more interesting is the fact that the current low is still no where near the 374 low. A rally here is not only a broader sign of strength, but offers greater potential compared to a counter trend retrace. 

Earlier today on S.C., I published a  BTC 0.04%  article about bottoming patterns. They are usually made up of a series of structures, but what makes them most significant is where they are developing.  

The pattern is actually clearer in this market than it is in  BTC 0.04% . The 418 low is not that much lower than the 450 low, a  pin bar  is present off the 423 reversal zone boundary and now a  spinning top  is materializing off the same level. Together, these structures could be the beginning of an inverted  head and shoulders  formation which is  bullish . 

If this pattern continues to unfold around the current price level, it would also be establishing a very broad higher low formation. I wrote about this in a previous report that looked at the  Elliott Wave  count. 

The potential target for a broader higher low formation is the 581 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  structure). This will not happen over night, but certainly within reason over the next month. 

In summary, like I have been writing on S.C., we always consider the broad probability of the location when evaluating levels and trends. We do not rely on oscillators or moving averages for these situations because they are not the most effective tools for anticipating broad reversals.  

For that reason we manage inventory as well as short term swing trades when the risk makes sense. At the present, the reward/risk is favoring both position and swing trade strategies long. It is all a matter of having a process to quantify that risk and decide if it is within the scope of your tolerance. 

If the current  spinning top  closes and the next candle takes out the high, that is a technical trigger to go long. We are long  BTC 0.04%  so we will not be officially calling this trade idea in order to keep risk within the scope of our overall plan.

I think many are watching this  double bottom , and it is safe to assume a rise of around 50%. Also lines up with downtrendline from triangle.
