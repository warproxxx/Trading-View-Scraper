1530546230.0,jaysag33,LTC still within bearish channel,"
 Bitcoin 4.34%  and Litecoin have been making some moves as of late even showing a  bullish  break of this valley started a week ago.  However, it is still within the  bearish channel  from the last daily high.  If we break that channel, I will go long, otherwise still waiting for one last drop before we call $73 as the bottom.
