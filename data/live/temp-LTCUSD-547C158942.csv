so i got comments about my idea being  bearish  CRAP! well today is now wednesday 11:15 am CST and what do you know VERY STRUCTURED . take your positions and ride the long train to friday evening. take in consideration hedge fund guys are wanting to make money as it is half the year gone.....and quarterly quotas need to be scalped. dont get caught at the top of the pattern cause its another ride to the down side for the next quarter!....

If you compare the March-April correction you can see we are forming a very similar structure for the reversal.  We have  RSI  and  MACD bullish divergence  building over the past week or so and it looks like the sellers are getting exhausted.  Always a chance for another push to test lower, but I don't see any reason it would go below 65 and it may already have found bottom at 73.  Refer to the March 31-April 2 chart for where we are now in the process.  Remember - bottom is a process, not a specific number.  The predicted continuation of the  Elliot  impulse aligns well with the resistance points/fibs already established, so it should be pretty predictable for the next few moves.

On the 2 day chart,  LTCUSD 6.48%  has the look of wanting to turn back to the north.  Basing this on the  support and resistance  that are showing on the 2 week chart.  Watch the  CCI  and consider why you like this investment:  because you can track with leverage,to buy low and hold, to use for spending on purchases, to buy low and sell high...  LTCUSD 6.48%  will most definitely reach back towards $175 after it bottoms.  Waiting until $63 for 1/4 of cryptocurrency entry, if goes to $50, then ALL IN BABY!!!  well I only invest a little bit in crypto right now ;)  Wish I could short and use leverage US!
