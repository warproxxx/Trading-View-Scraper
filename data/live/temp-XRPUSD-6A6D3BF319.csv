Hey guys, Ripple is in a tightening pattern with the last Lower Highs at 0,507 and the  double bottom  of support now at 0,474. => This clearly favors the bears, but if we can stay above it, the equilibrium will tighten even more, giving a nice trading opportunity.  So watch for grandpa  BTC -1.74% , as it will dictate the direction we break. => I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  Wish you a good trading!

A lot of people are calling for a bottom of this  bearish  downtrend and sentiment is turning  bullish  (perhaps prematurely). We have had a solid bounce the past week and  BTC              Longs have continued to climb whilst shorts/long gap has been growing. I see XRP following a similar to pattern to it's previous dumps and 4hr  MACD  has crossed  bearish . I am currently in no position. When in doubt stay out. If this is the end of the bear market there will be plenty of opportunities ahead. However I am not yet convinced, may change my mind depending on what  BTC              does in the next few 4HR candles. Range has been tightening and a big move is coming, unsure of the direction just yet however I am leaning  bearish . This bias may be my undoing however a trader must protect their capital and this is why I will keep my funds for another day.  Previous all time high is ~$0.40 to ~$0.38 depending on which exchange you look at, I am looking for entries around this area.

I am  bullish  on XRP as a stake holder - but I can't deny what I see in the charts. 

XRP as I have predicted in previous analysis moved up to the .50 mark after flirting with lows around .42  

It appears we are forming  a head on an  H&S  pattern. We wont know until we have confirmation on the right side - but if you are looking to short the trade you should be looking to sell soon and hold at least until we begin banding around .45 

There is a possibility that we drop to .43 before we make a more convincing run and break through .50. 

I don't expect this pattern to hold more than a few days as weekend traders will likely push it along. 

It's still a great time to take a position in XRP - and if the price drop does happen as predicted - XRP will be an even better deal ~.45 

Those of you in for the long haul - keep holding!
