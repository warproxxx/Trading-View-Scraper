1530988016.0,azharm87,LTC/USD: Losing Momentum...Likely to Retest $73,"
without any catalyst or strong shift in sentiment across cryptos LTC will likely retest $73 and possible break down.  i've seen a lot of indication of interest around $50-$60 so lets see if buyers show up.  welcome any thoughts.
