In the last analyses I pointed out possible positive divergence by the  RSI  indicator which is a stronger sign for a bottom. With the  Bollinger Bands  indicator narrowing a bigger move may be on it's way, and wthis tiome it could go north. 

The best sign for this is when bulls can set a higher high on this  daily chart  (a move over the latest lower high around 6850). Expect an attempt for this if the downward sloping line gets taken out around 6510, first resistance.  

Support is seen at 5850 and could be seen if 6510 continues to see problems. A move over 6850 implies a run at the next downward sloping line, around 8300.

Entered long at 5913 on  bullish bat  forming 2 days ago, now we have a kumo cross,  TK 1.57%  cross, cloud breakout and  RSI  breakout all  bullish . The OBV still cant get above the level that held as support since October 2017.  Bearish Bat  could possibly be forming as well after the next leg of this movement up. I am  bullish  up to 7.5k if  RSI  resistance can turn to support and we can break above the OBV level and see the bat fail. However  volume  is not exactly convincing and the precise levels on the bat  harmonic  means 6.7k is likely to be a very strong resistance.  

I am looking to add to my position at 6.3k where the cloud/daily open level can hold as support at what would be at the bottom of the flag. 

I would be stopped out of all long positions in profit below the weekly close level at 6.1k 

I want to short 6.7k or 7.5k. Nothing shows we will be breaking  bearish  market structure anytime soon

Red  trend lines  represent the daily candles...showing us support.

1530411572.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Short Squeeze As USD Peaks. Is This The Beginning?,"
 BTCUSD              update: After the 6170 long trigger, price tested the 6431 to 6614 minor  resistance zone  quickly. This also happens to be where the  bearish trend line  is located. This type of price action is not a surprise since we have been writing about the high probability location for at least two weeks now. 

The 6K psychological support, reversal zone boundaries at 5956 and 5669 along with the 8171 to 4938 broad support have been the focus. At S.C. we have been building inventory and continue to look for long trades in these markets.  

What appears to be the key driver behind this surge in momentum is the U.S. Dollar. If you take a look at a larger time frame  Dollar Index              chart, you will notice the same type of price action, but inverted. Instead of a failed low, you will observe a failed high. 

Interestingly enough, this reversal can been seen across forex pairs that counter the Dollar like EUR and GBP.  

Do not forget, the major coins trade against fiat, and the world reserve currency is still the USD. That means it carries the most weight. Any broad moves in the Dollar can have dramatic effects on these coins. 

If there is now a higher correlation to the USD, I want to be aware of it. For this reason I will be publishing a technical report on the USD on S.C. tomorrow so make sure to look for it. 

In summary, at S.C., we are waiting for the next swing trade entry long. Since  bearish  structures are still in play, a retrace is likely, but the probability of a subsequent higher low has increased. Any pull back into the 6K area, followed by a long trigger will prompt us to participate in another long trade idea.  

Stops and targets will continue to be conservative until broader  bearish  structures are taken out such as the 7381 resistance (.382 of current  bearish  structure).  

The probability of the broader location outweighs the smaller time frame noise. And it has been reiterating long over and over. Do not lose sight, especially if this market decides to retest the lows once more. The next pull back will either make or break the broader reversal that appears to be in progress.

In the last analyses I pointed out possible positive divergence by the  RSI  indicator which is a stronger sign for a bottom. With the  Bollinger Bands  indicator narrowing a bigger move may be on it's way, and wthis tiome it could go north. 

The best sign for this is when bulls can set a higher high on this  daily chart  (a move over the latest lower high around 6850). Expect an attempt for this if the downward sloping line gets taken out around 6510, first resistance.  

Support is seen at 5850 and could be seen if 6510 continues to see problems. A move over 6850 implies a run at the next downward sloping line, around 8300.

Entered long at 5913 on  bullish bat  forming 2 days ago, now we have a kumo cross,  TK 1.57%  cross, cloud breakout and  RSI  breakout all  bullish . The OBV still cant get above the level that held as support since October 2017.  Bearish Bat  could possibly be forming as well after the next leg of this movement up. I am  bullish  up to 7.5k if  RSI  resistance can turn to support and we can break above the OBV level and see the bat fail. However  volume  is not exactly convincing and the precise levels on the bat  harmonic  means 6.7k is likely to be a very strong resistance.  

I am looking to add to my position at 6.3k where the cloud/daily open level can hold as support at what would be at the bottom of the flag. 

I would be stopped out of all long positions in profit below the weekly close level at 6.1k 

I want to short 6.7k or 7.5k. Nothing shows we will be breaking  bearish  market structure anytime soon

Red  trend lines  represent the daily candles...showing us support.

1530411572.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Short Squeeze As USD Peaks. Is This The Beginning?,"
 BTCUSD              update: After the 6170 long trigger, price tested the 6431 to 6614 minor  resistance zone  quickly. This also happens to be where the  bearish trend line  is located. This type of price action is not a surprise since we have been writing about the high probability location for at least two weeks now. 

The 6K psychological support, reversal zone boundaries at 5956 and 5669 along with the 8171 to 4938 broad support have been the focus. At S.C. we have been building inventory and continue to look for long trades in these markets.  

What appears to be the key driver behind this surge in momentum is the U.S. Dollar. If you take a look at a larger time frame  Dollar Index              chart, you will notice the same type of price action, but inverted. Instead of a failed low, you will observe a failed high. 

Interestingly enough, this reversal can been seen across forex pairs that counter the Dollar like EUR and GBP.  

Do not forget, the major coins trade against fiat, and the world reserve currency is still the USD. That means it carries the most weight. Any broad moves in the Dollar can have dramatic effects on these coins. 

If there is now a higher correlation to the USD, I want to be aware of it. For this reason I will be publishing a technical report on the USD on S.C. tomorrow so make sure to look for it. 

In summary, at S.C., we are waiting for the next swing trade entry long. Since  bearish  structures are still in play, a retrace is likely, but the probability of a subsequent higher low has increased. Any pull back into the 6K area, followed by a long trigger will prompt us to participate in another long trade idea.  

Stops and targets will continue to be conservative until broader  bearish  structures are taken out such as the 7381 resistance (.382 of current  bearish  structure).  

The probability of the broader location outweighs the smaller time frame noise. And it has been reiterating long over and over. Do not lose sight, especially if this market decides to retest the lows once more. The next pull back will either make or break the broader reversal that appears to be in progress.

The probability of the broader location outweighs the smaller time frame noise. And it has been reiterating long over and over. Do not lose sight, especially if this market decides to retest the lows once more. The next pull back will either make or break the broader reversal that appears to be in progress.

In the last analyses I pointed out possible positive divergence by the  RSI  indicator which is a stronger sign for a bottom. With the  Bollinger Bands  indicator narrowing a bigger move may be on it's way, and wthis tiome it could go north. 

The best sign for this is when bulls can set a higher high on this  daily chart  (a move over the latest lower high around 6850). Expect an attempt for this if the downward sloping line gets taken out around 6510, first resistance.  

Support is seen at 5850 and could be seen if 6510 continues to see problems. A move over 6850 implies a run at the next downward sloping line, around 8300.

Entered long at 5913 on  bullish bat  forming 2 days ago, now we have a kumo cross,  TK 1.57%  cross, cloud breakout and  RSI  breakout all  bullish . The OBV still cant get above the level that held as support since October 2017.  Bearish Bat  could possibly be forming as well after the next leg of this movement up. I am  bullish  up to 7.5k if  RSI  resistance can turn to support and we can break above the OBV level and see the bat fail. However  volume  is not exactly convincing and the precise levels on the bat  harmonic  means 6.7k is likely to be a very strong resistance.  

I am looking to add to my position at 6.3k where the cloud/daily open level can hold as support at what would be at the bottom of the flag. 

I would be stopped out of all long positions in profit below the weekly close level at 6.1k 

I want to short 6.7k or 7.5k. Nothing shows we will be breaking  bearish  market structure anytime soon

Red  trend lines  represent the daily candles...showing us support.

1530411572.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Short Squeeze As USD Peaks. Is This The Beginning?,"
 BTCUSD -0.50%  update: After the 6170 long trigger, price tested the 6431 to 6614 minor  resistance zone  quickly. This also happens to be where the  bearish trend line  is located. This type of price action is not a surprise since we have been writing about the high probability location for at least two weeks now. 

The 6K psychological support, reversal zone boundaries at 5956 and 5669 along with the 8171 to 4938 broad support have been the focus. At S.C. we have been building inventory and continue to look for long trades in these markets.  

What appears to be the key driver behind this surge in momentum is the U.S. Dollar. If you take a look at a larger time frame  Dollar Index -0.43%  chart, you will notice the same type of price action, but inverted. Instead of a failed low, you will observe a failed high. 

Interestingly enough, this reversal can been seen across forex pairs that counter the Dollar like EUR and GBP.  

Do not forget, the major coins trade against fiat, and the world reserve currency is still the USD. That means it carries the most weight. Any broad moves in the Dollar can have dramatic effects on these coins. 

If there is now a higher correlation to the USD, I want to be aware of it. For this reason I will be publishing a technical report on the USD on S.C. tomorrow so make sure to look for it. 

In summary, at S.C., we are waiting for the next swing trade entry long. Since  bearish  structures are still in play, a retrace is likely, but the probability of a subsequent higher low has increased. Any pull back into the 6K area, followed by a long trigger will prompt us to participate in another long trade idea.  

Stops and targets will continue to be conservative until broader  bearish  structures are taken out such as the 7381 resistance (.382 of current  bearish  structure).

In summary, at S.C., we are waiting for the next swing trade entry long. Since  bearish  structures are still in play, a retrace is likely, but the probability of a subsequent higher low has increased. Any pull back into the 6K area, followed by a long trigger will prompt us to participate in another long trade idea.  

Stops and targets will continue to be conservative until broader  bearish  structures are taken out such as the 7381 resistance (.382 of current  bearish  structure).  

The probability of the broader location outweighs the smaller time frame noise. And it has been reiterating long over and over. Do not lose sight, especially if this market decides to retest the lows once more. The next pull back will either make or break the broader reversal that appears to be in progress.

In the last analyses I pointed out possible positive divergence by the  RSI  indicator which is a stronger sign for a bottom. With the  Bollinger Bands  indicator narrowing a bigger move may be on it's way, and wthis tiome it could go north. 

The best sign for this is when bulls can set a higher high on this  daily chart  (a move over the latest lower high around 6850). Expect an attempt for this if the downward sloping line gets taken out around 6510, first resistance.  

Support is seen at 5850 and could be seen if 6510 continues to see problems. A move over 6850 implies a run at the next downward sloping line, around 8300.

Entered long at 5913 on  bullish bat  forming 2 days ago, now we have a kumo cross,  TK 1.57%  cross, cloud breakout and  RSI  breakout all  bullish . The OBV still cant get above the level that held as support since October 2017.  Bearish Bat  could possibly be forming as well after the next leg of this movement up. I am  bullish  up to 7.5k if  RSI  resistance can turn to support and we can break above the OBV level and see the bat fail. However  volume  is not exactly convincing and the precise levels on the bat  harmonic  means 6.7k is likely to be a very strong resistance.  

I am looking to add to my position at 6.3k where the cloud/daily open level can hold as support at what would be at the bottom of the flag. 

I would be stopped out of all long positions in profit below the weekly close level at 6.1k 

I want to short 6.7k or 7.5k. Nothing shows we will be breaking  bearish  market structure anytime soon

1530411572.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Short Squeeze As USD Peaks. Is This The Beginning?,"
 BTCUSD -0.51%  update: After the 6170 long trigger, price tested the 6431 to 6614 minor  resistance zone  quickly. This also happens to be where the  bearish trend line  is located. This type of price action is not a surprise since we have been writing about the high probability location for at least two weeks now. 

The 6K psychological support, reversal zone boundaries at 5956 and 5669 along with the 8171 to 4938 broad support have been the focus. At S.C. we have been building inventory and continue to look for long trades in these markets.  

What appears to be the key driver behind this surge in momentum is the U.S. Dollar. If you take a look at a larger time frame  Dollar Index -0.43%  chart, you will notice the same type of price action, but inverted. Instead of a failed low, you will observe a failed high. 

Interestingly enough, this reversal can been seen across forex pairs that counter the Dollar like EUR and GBP.  

Do not forget, the major coins trade against fiat, and the world reserve currency is still the USD. That means it carries the most weight. Any broad moves in the Dollar can have dramatic effects on these coins. 

If there is now a higher correlation to the USD, I want to be aware of it. For this reason I will be publishing a technical report on the USD on S.C. tomorrow so make sure to look for it.

What appears to be the key driver behind this surge in momentum is the U.S. Dollar. If you take a look at a larger time frame  Dollar Index -0.43%  chart, you will notice the same type of price action, but inverted. Instead of a failed low, you will observe a failed high. 

Interestingly enough, this reversal can been seen across forex pairs that counter the Dollar like EUR and GBP.  

Do not forget, the major coins trade against fiat, and the world reserve currency is still the USD. That means it carries the most weight. Any broad moves in the Dollar can have dramatic effects on these coins. 

If there is now a higher correlation to the USD, I want to be aware of it. For this reason I will be publishing a technical report on the USD on S.C. tomorrow so make sure to look for it. 

In summary, at S.C., we are waiting for the next swing trade entry long. Since  bearish  structures are still in play, a retrace is likely, but the probability of a subsequent higher low has increased. Any pull back into the 6K area, followed by a long trigger will prompt us to participate in another long trade idea.  

Stops and targets will continue to be conservative until broader  bearish  structures are taken out such as the 7381 resistance (.382 of current  bearish  structure).  

The probability of the broader location outweighs the smaller time frame noise. And it has been reiterating long over and over. Do not lose sight, especially if this market decides to retest the lows once more. The next pull back will either make or break the broader reversal that appears to be in progress.

In the last analyses I pointed out possible positive divergence by the  RSI  indicator which is a stronger sign for a bottom. With the  Bollinger Bands  indicator narrowing a bigger move may be on it's way, and wthis tiome it could go north. 

The best sign for this is when bulls can set a higher high on this  daily chart  (a move over the latest lower high around 6850). Expect an attempt for this if the downward sloping line gets taken out around 6510, first resistance.  

Support is seen at 5850 and could be seen if 6510 continues to see problems. A move over 6850 implies a run at the next downward sloping line, around 8300.

Entered long at 5913 on  bullish bat  forming 2 days ago, now we have a kumo cross,  TK 1.57%  cross, cloud breakout and  RSI  breakout all  bullish . The OBV still cant get above the level that held as support since October 2017.  Bearish Bat  could possibly be forming as well after the next leg of this movement up. I am  bullish  up to 7.5k if  RSI  resistance can turn to support and we can break above the OBV level and see the bat fail. However  volume  is not exactly convincing and the precise levels on the bat  harmonic  means 6.7k is likely to be a very strong resistance.  

I am looking to add to my position at 6.3k where the cloud/daily open level can hold as support at what would be at the bottom of the flag. 

I would be stopped out of all long positions in profit below the weekly close level at 6.1k 

I want to short 6.7k or 7.5k. Nothing shows we will be breaking  bearish  market structure anytime soon

 BTCUSD -0.51%  update: After the 6170 long trigger, price tested the 6431 to 6614 minor  resistance zone  quickly. This also happens to be where the  bearish trend line  is located. This type of price action is not a surprise since we have been writing about the high probability location for at least two weeks now. 

The 6K psychological support, reversal zone boundaries at 5956 and 5669 along with the 8171 to 4938 broad support have been the focus. At S.C. we have been building inventory and continue to look for long trades in these markets.  

What appears to be the key driver behind this surge in momentum is the U.S. Dollar. If you take a look at a larger time frame  Dollar Index -0.43%  chart, you will notice the same type of price action, but inverted. Instead of a failed low, you will observe a failed high. 

Interestingly enough, this reversal can been seen across forex pairs that counter the Dollar like EUR and GBP.  

Do not forget, the major coins trade against fiat, and the world reserve currency is still the USD. That means it carries the most weight. Any broad moves in the Dollar can have dramatic effects on these coins. 

If there is now a higher correlation to the USD, I want to be aware of it. For this reason I will be publishing a technical report on the USD on S.C. tomorrow so make sure to look for it. 

In summary, at S.C., we are waiting for the next swing trade entry long. Since  bearish  structures are still in play, a retrace is likely, but the probability of a subsequent higher low has increased. Any pull back into the 6K area, followed by a long trigger will prompt us to participate in another long trade idea.  

Stops and targets will continue to be conservative until broader  bearish  structures are taken out such as the 7381 resistance (.382 of current  bearish  structure).  

The probability of the broader location outweighs the smaller time frame noise. And it has been reiterating long over and over. Do not lose sight, especially if this market decides to retest the lows once more. The next pull back will either make or break the broader reversal that appears to be in progress.

In the last analyses I pointed out possible positive divergence by the  RSI  indicator which is a stronger sign for a bottom. With the  Bollinger Bands  indicator narrowing a bigger move may be on it's way, and wthis tiome it could go north. 

The best sign for this is when bulls can set a higher high on this  daily chart  (a move over the latest lower high around 6850). Expect an attempt for this if the downward sloping line gets taken out around 6510, first resistance.  

Support is seen at 5850 and could be seen if 6510 continues to see problems. A move over 6850 implies a run at the next downward sloping line, around 8300.

Entered long at 5913 on  bullish bat  forming 2 days ago, now we have a kumo cross,  TK 1.57%  cross, cloud breakout and  RSI  breakout all  bullish . The OBV still cant get above the level that held as support since October 2017.  Bearish Bat  could possibly be forming as well after the next leg of this movement up. I am  bullish  up to 7.5k if  RSI  resistance can turn to support and we can break above the OBV level and see the bat fail. However  volume  is not exactly convincing and the precise levels on the bat  harmonic  means 6.7k is likely to be a very strong resistance.  

I am looking to add to my position at 6.3k where the cloud/daily open level can hold as support at what would be at the bottom of the flag. 

I would be stopped out of all long positions in profit below the weekly close level at 6.1k 

I want to short 6.7k or 7.5k. Nothing shows we will be breaking  bearish  market structure anytime soon

1530411572.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Short Squeeze As USD Peaks. Is This The Beginning?,"
 BTCUSD -0.51%  update: After the 6170 long trigger, price tested the 6431 to 6614 minor  resistance zone  quickly. This also happens to be where the  bearish trend line  is located. This type of price action is not a surprise since we have been writing about the high probability location for at least two weeks now. 

The 6K psychological support, reversal zone boundaries at 5956 and 5669 along with the 8171 to 4938 broad support have been the focus. At S.C. we have been building inventory and continue to look for long trades in these markets.  

What appears to be the key driver behind this surge in momentum is the U.S. Dollar. If you take a look at a larger time frame  Dollar Index -0.43%  chart, you will notice the same type of price action, but inverted. Instead of a failed low, you will observe a failed high. 

Interestingly enough, this reversal can been seen across forex pairs that counter the Dollar like EUR and GBP.  

Do not forget, the major coins trade against fiat, and the world reserve currency is still the USD. That means it carries the most weight. Any broad moves in the Dollar can have dramatic effects on these coins. 

If there is now a higher correlation to the USD, I want to be aware of it. For this reason I will be publishing a technical report on the USD on S.C. tomorrow so make sure to look for it. 

In summary, at S.C., we are waiting for the next swing trade entry long. Since  bearish  structures are still in play, a retrace is likely, but the probability of a subsequent higher low has increased. Any pull back into the 6K area, followed by a long trigger will prompt us to participate in another long trade idea.  

Stops and targets will continue to be conservative until broader  bearish  structures are taken out such as the 7381 resistance (.382 of current  bearish  structure).  

The probability of the broader location outweighs the smaller time frame noise. And it has been reiterating long over and over. Do not lose sight, especially if this market decides to retest the lows once more. The next pull back will either make or break the broader reversal that appears to be in progress.

In the last analyses I pointed out possible positive divergence by the  RSI  indicator which is a stronger sign for a bottom. With the  Bollinger Bands  indicator narrowing a bigger move may be on it's way, and wthis tiome it could go north. 

The best sign for this is when bulls can set a higher high on this  daily chart  (a move over the latest lower high around 6850). Expect an attempt for this if the downward sloping line gets taken out around 6510, first resistance.  

Support is seen at 5850 and could be seen if 6510 continues to see problems. A move over 6850 implies a run at the next downward sloping line, around 8300.

Entered long at 5913 on  bullish bat  forming 2 days ago, now we have a kumo cross,  TK 1.57%  cross, cloud breakout and  RSI  breakout all  bullish . The OBV still cant get above the level that held as support since October 2017.  Bearish Bat  could possibly be forming as well after the next leg of this movement up. I am  bullish  up to 7.5k if  RSI  resistance can turn to support and we can break above the OBV level and see the bat fail. However  volume  is not exactly convincing and the precise levels on the bat  harmonic  means 6.7k is likely to be a very strong resistance.  

I am looking to add to my position at 6.3k where the cloud/daily open level can hold as support at what would be at the bottom of the flag. 

I would be stopped out of all long positions in profit below the weekly close level at 6.1k 

I want to short 6.7k or 7.5k. Nothing shows we will be breaking  bearish  market structure anytime soon

Red  trend lines  represent the daily candles...showing us support.

1530411572.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Short Squeeze As USD Peaks. Is This The Beginning?,"
 BTCUSD -0.51%  update: After the 6170 long trigger, price tested the 6431 to 6614 minor  resistance zone  quickly. This also happens to be where the  bearish trend line  is located. This type of price action is not a surprise since we have been writing about the high probability location for at least two weeks now. 

The 6K psychological support, reversal zone boundaries at 5956 and 5669 along with the 8171 to 4938 broad support have been the focus. At S.C. we have been building inventory and continue to look for long trades in these markets.  

What appears to be the key driver behind this surge in momentum is the U.S. Dollar. If you take a look at a larger time frame  Dollar Index -0.43%  chart, you will notice the same type of price action, but inverted. Instead of a failed low, you will observe a failed high. 

Interestingly enough, this reversal can been seen across forex pairs that counter the Dollar like EUR and GBP.  

Do not forget, the major coins trade against fiat, and the world reserve currency is still the USD. That means it carries the most weight. Any broad moves in the Dollar can have dramatic effects on these coins. 

If there is now a higher correlation to the USD, I want to be aware of it. For this reason I will be publishing a technical report on the USD on S.C. tomorrow so make sure to look for it. 

In summary, at S.C., we are waiting for the next swing trade entry long. Since  bearish  structures are still in play, a retrace is likely, but the probability of a subsequent higher low has increased. Any pull back into the 6K area, followed by a long trigger will prompt us to participate in another long trade idea.  

Stops and targets will continue to be conservative until broader  bearish  structures are taken out such as the 7381 resistance (.382 of current  bearish  structure).  

The probability of the broader location outweighs the smaller time frame noise. And it has been reiterating long over and over. Do not lose sight, especially if this market decides to retest the lows once more. The next pull back will either make or break the broader reversal that appears to be in progress.

In the last analyses I pointed out possible positive divergence by the  RSI  indicator which is a stronger sign for a bottom. With the  Bollinger Bands  indicator narrowing a bigger move may be on it's way, and wthis tiome it could go north. 

The best sign for this is when bulls can set a higher high on this  daily chart  (a move over the latest lower high around 6850). Expect an attempt for this if the downward sloping line gets taken out around 6510, first resistance.  

Support is seen at 5850 and could be seen if 6510 continues to see problems. A move over 6850 implies a run at the next downward sloping line, around 8300.

Entered long at 5913 on  bullish bat  forming 2 days ago, now we have a kumo cross,  TK 1.57%  cross, cloud breakout and  RSI  breakout all  bullish . The OBV still cant get above the level that held as support since October 2017.  Bearish Bat  could possibly be forming as well after the next leg of this movement up. I am  bullish  up to 7.5k if  RSI  resistance can turn to support and we can break above the OBV level and see the bat fail. However  volume  is not exactly convincing and the precise levels on the bat  harmonic  means 6.7k is likely to be a very strong resistance.  

I am looking to add to my position at 6.3k where the cloud/daily open level can hold as support at what would be at the bottom of the flag. 

I would be stopped out of all long positions in profit below the weekly close level at 6.1k 

I want to short 6.7k or 7.5k. Nothing shows we will be breaking  bearish  market structure anytime soon

Red  trend lines  represent the daily candles...showing us support. Blue = the 4hr candle  trend line ... on 4hr chart if new candle closes under blue resistance line we will probably go down to red support  trend line  and bounce back up from there, so its maybe a good idea to buy around that red line price around ($4800)...if we close above the blue line there is resistance at 6740, if we break over 6740 next resistance will be 7350

1530411572.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Short Squeeze As USD Peaks. Is This The Beginning?,"
 BTCUSD -0.51%  update: After the 6170 long trigger, price tested the 6431 to 6614 minor  resistance zone  quickly. This also happens to be where the  bearish trend line  is located. This type of price action is not a surprise since we have been writing about the high probability location for at least two weeks now. 

The 6K psychological support, reversal zone boundaries at 5956 and 5669 along with the 8171 to 4938 broad support have been the focus. At S.C. we have been building inventory and continue to look for long trades in these markets.  

What appears to be the key driver behind this surge in momentum is the U.S. Dollar. If you take a look at a larger time frame  Dollar Index -0.43%  chart, you will notice the same type of price action, but inverted. Instead of a failed low, you will observe a failed high. 

Interestingly enough, this reversal can been seen across forex pairs that counter the Dollar like EUR and GBP.  

Do not forget, the major coins trade against fiat, and the world reserve currency is still the USD. That means it carries the most weight. Any broad moves in the Dollar can have dramatic effects on these coins. 

If there is now a higher correlation to the USD, I want to be aware of it. For this reason I will be publishing a technical report on the USD on S.C. tomorrow so make sure to look for it. 

In summary, at S.C., we are waiting for the next swing trade entry long. Since  bearish  structures are still in play, a retrace is likely, but the probability of a subsequent higher low has increased. Any pull back into the 6K area, followed by a long trigger will prompt us to participate in another long trade idea.  

Stops and targets will continue to be conservative until broader  bearish  structures are taken out such as the 7381 resistance (.382 of current  bearish  structure).  

The probability of the broader location outweighs the smaller time frame noise. And it has been reiterating long over and over. Do not lose sight, especially if this market decides to retest the lows once more. The next pull back will either make or break the broader reversal that appears to be in progress.

In the last analyses I pointed out possible positive divergence by the  RSI  indicator which is a stronger sign for a bottom. With the  Bollinger Bands  indicator narrowing a bigger move may be on it's way, and wthis tiome it could go north. 

The best sign for this is when bulls can set a higher high on this  daily chart  (a move over the latest lower high around 6850). Expect an attempt for this if the downward sloping line gets taken out around 6510, first resistance.  

Support is seen at 5850 and could be seen if 6510 continues to see problems. A move over 6850 implies a run at the next downward sloping line, around 8300.

Entered long at 5913 on  bullish bat  forming 2 days ago, now we have a kumo cross,  TK 1.57%  cross, cloud breakout and  RSI  breakout all  bullish . The OBV still cant get above the level that held as support since October 2017.  Bearish Bat  could possibly be forming as well after the next leg of this movement up. I am  bullish  up to 7.5k if  RSI  resistance can turn to support and we can break above the OBV level and see the bat fail. However  volume  is not exactly convincing and the precise levels on the bat  harmonic  means 6.7k is likely to be a very strong resistance.  

I am looking to add to my position at 6.3k where the cloud/daily open level can hold as support at what would be at the bottom of the flag. 

I would be stopped out of all long positions in profit below the weekly close level at 6.1k 

I want to short 6.7k or 7.5k. Nothing shows we will be breaking  bearish  market structure anytime soon

Red  trend lines  represent the daily candles...showing us support.

1530411572.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Short Squeeze As USD Peaks. Is This The Beginning?,"
 BTCUSD -0.44%  update: After the 6170 long trigger, price tested the 6431 to 6614 minor  resistance zone  quickly. This also happens to be where the  bearish trend line  is located. This type of price action is not a surprise since we have been writing about the high probability location for at least two weeks now. 

The 6K psychological support, reversal zone boundaries at 5956 and 5669 along with the 8171 to 4938 broad support have been the focus. At S.C. we have been building inventory and continue to look for long trades in these markets.  

What appears to be the key driver behind this surge in momentum is the U.S. Dollar. If you take a look at a larger time frame  Dollar Index -0.43%  chart, you will notice the same type of price action, but inverted. Instead of a failed low, you will observe a failed high. 

Interestingly enough, this reversal can been seen across forex pairs that counter the Dollar like EUR and GBP.  

Do not forget, the major coins trade against fiat, and the world reserve currency is still the USD. That means it carries the most weight. Any broad moves in the Dollar can have dramatic effects on these coins. 

If there is now a higher correlation to the USD, I want to be aware of it. For this reason I will be publishing a technical report on the USD on S.C. tomorrow so make sure to look for it. 

In summary, at S.C., we are waiting for the next swing trade entry long. Since  bearish  structures are still in play, a retrace is likely, but the probability of a subsequent higher low has increased. Any pull back into the 6K area, followed by a long trigger will prompt us to participate in another long trade idea.  

Stops and targets will continue to be conservative until broader  bearish  structures are taken out such as the 7381 resistance (.382 of current  bearish  structure).  

The probability of the broader location outweighs the smaller time frame noise. And it has been reiterating long over and over. Do not lose sight, especially if this market decides to retest the lows once more. The next pull back will either make or break the broader reversal that appears to be in progress.

In the last analyses I pointed out possible positive divergence by the  RSI  indicator which is a stronger sign for a bottom. With the  Bollinger Bands  indicator narrowing a bigger move may be on it's way, and wthis tiome it could go north. 

The best sign for this is when bulls can set a higher high on this  daily chart  (a move over the latest lower high around 6850). Expect an attempt for this if the downward sloping line gets taken out around 6510, first resistance.  

Support is seen at 5850 and could be seen if 6510 continues to see problems. A move over 6850 implies a run at the next downward sloping line, around 8300.

Entered long at 5913 on  bullish bat  forming 2 days ago, now we have a kumo cross,  TK 1.57%  cross, cloud breakout and  RSI  breakout all  bullish . The OBV still cant get above the level that held as support since October 2017.  Bearish Bat  could possibly be forming as well after the next leg of this movement up. I am  bullish  up to 7.5k if  RSI  resistance can turn to support and we can break above the OBV level and see the bat fail. However  volume  is not exactly convincing and the precise levels on the bat  harmonic  means 6.7k is likely to be a very strong resistance.  

I am looking to add to my position at 6.3k where the cloud/daily open level can hold as support at what would be at the bottom of the flag. 

I would be stopped out of all long positions in profit below the weekly close level at 6.1k 

I want to short 6.7k or 7.5k. Nothing shows we will be breaking  bearish  market structure anytime soon

Red  trend lines  represent the daily candles...showing us support.

1530411572.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Short Squeeze As USD Peaks. Is This The Beginning?,"
 BTCUSD -0.41%  update: After the 6170 long trigger, price tested the 6431 to 6614 minor  resistance zone  quickly. This also happens to be where the  bearish trend line  is located. This type of price action is not a surprise since we have been writing about the high probability location for at least two weeks now. 

The 6K psychological support, reversal zone boundaries at 5956 and 5669 along with the 8171 to 4938 broad support have been the focus. At S.C. we have been building inventory and continue to look for long trades in these markets.  

What appears to be the key driver behind this surge in momentum is the U.S. Dollar. If you take a look at a larger time frame  Dollar Index -0.43%  chart, you will notice the same type of price action, but inverted. Instead of a failed low, you will observe a failed high. 

Interestingly enough, this reversal can been seen across forex pairs that counter the Dollar like EUR and GBP.  

Do not forget, the major coins trade against fiat, and the world reserve currency is still the USD. That means it carries the most weight. Any broad moves in the Dollar can have dramatic effects on these coins. 

If there is now a higher correlation to the USD, I want to be aware of it. For this reason I will be publishing a technical report on the USD on S.C. tomorrow so make sure to look for it. 

In summary, at S.C., we are waiting for the next swing trade entry long. Since  bearish  structures are still in play, a retrace is likely, but the probability of a subsequent higher low has increased. Any pull back into the 6K area, followed by a long trigger will prompt us to participate in another long trade idea.  

Stops and targets will continue to be conservative until broader  bearish  structures are taken out such as the 7381 resistance (.382 of current  bearish  structure).  

The probability of the broader location outweighs the smaller time frame noise. And it has been reiterating long over and over. Do not lose sight, especially if this market decides to retest the lows once more. The next pull back will either make or break the broader reversal that appears to be in progress.

In the last analyses I pointed out possible positive divergence by the  RSI  indicator which is a stronger sign for a bottom. With the  Bollinger Bands  indicator narrowing a bigger move may be on it's way, and wthis tiome it could go north. 

The best sign for this is when bulls can set a higher high on this  daily chart  (a move over the latest lower high around 6850). Expect an attempt for this if the downward sloping line gets taken out around 6510, first resistance.  

Support is seen at 5850 and could be seen if 6510 continues to see problems. A move over 6850 implies a run at the next downward sloping line, around 8300.

Entered long at 5913 on  bullish bat  forming 2 days ago, now we have a kumo cross,  TK 1.57%  cross, cloud breakout and  RSI  breakout all  bullish . The OBV still cant get above the level that held as support since October 2017.  Bearish Bat  could possibly be forming as well after the next leg of this movement up. I am  bullish  up to 7.5k if  RSI  resistance can turn to support and we can break above the OBV level and see the bat fail. However  volume  is not exactly convincing and the precise levels on the bat  harmonic  means 6.7k is likely to be a very strong resistance.  

I am looking to add to my position at 6.3k where the cloud/daily open level can hold as support at what would be at the bottom of the flag. 

I would be stopped out of all long positions in profit below the weekly close level at 6.1k 

I want to short 6.7k or 7.5k. Nothing shows we will be breaking  bearish  market structure anytime soon

If you are following this series I would suggest writing down what is shown in notes to help your brain remember these patterns, rules, guidelines and more.  Elliot Wave  theory is based on pattern recognition, and to recognize these patterns in real-time you must first remember them.  

We will next be going over corrective patterns (Reactionary) !

1530411572.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Short Squeeze As USD Peaks. Is This The Beginning?,"
 BTCUSD -0.20%  update: After the 6170 long trigger, price tested the 6431 to 6614 minor  resistance zone  quickly. This also happens to be where the  bearish trend line  is located. This type of price action is not a surprise since we have been writing about the high probability location for at least two weeks now. 

The 6K psychological support, reversal zone boundaries at 5956 and 5669 along with the 8171 to 4938 broad support have been the focus. At S.C. we have been building inventory and continue to look for long trades in these markets.  

What appears to be the key driver behind this surge in momentum is the U.S. Dollar. If you take a look at a larger time frame  Dollar Index -0.43%  chart, you will notice the same type of price action, but inverted. Instead of a failed low, you will observe a failed high. 

Interestingly enough, this reversal can been seen across forex pairs that counter the Dollar like EUR and GBP.  

Do not forget, the major coins trade against fiat, and the world reserve currency is still the USD. That means it carries the most weight. Any broad moves in the Dollar can have dramatic effects on these coins. 

If there is now a higher correlation to the USD, I want to be aware of it. For this reason I will be publishing a technical report on the USD on S.C. tomorrow so make sure to look for it. 

In summary, at S.C., we are waiting for the next swing trade entry long. Since  bearish  structures are still in play, a retrace is likely, but the probability of a subsequent higher low has increased. Any pull back into the 6K area, followed by a long trigger will prompt us to participate in another long trade idea.  

Stops and targets will continue to be conservative until broader  bearish  structures are taken out such as the 7381 resistance (.382 of current  bearish  structure).  

The probability of the broader location outweighs the smaller time frame noise. And it has been reiterating long over and over. Do not lose sight, especially if this market decides to retest the lows once more. The next pull back will either make or break the broader reversal that appears to be in progress.

In the last analyses I pointed out possible positive divergence by the  RSI  indicator which is a stronger sign for a bottom. With the  Bollinger Bands  indicator narrowing a bigger move may be on it's way, and wthis tiome it could go north. 

The best sign for this is when bulls can set a higher high on this  daily chart  (a move over the latest lower high around 6850). Expect an attempt for this if the downward sloping line gets taken out around 6510, first resistance.  

Support is seen at 5850 and could be seen if 6510 continues to see problems. A move over 6850 implies a run at the next downward sloping line, around 8300.

Entered long at 5913 on  bullish bat  forming 2 days ago, now we have a kumo cross,  TK 1.57%  cross, cloud breakout and  RSI  breakout all  bullish . The OBV still cant get above the level that held as support since October 2017.  Bearish Bat  could possibly be forming as well after the next leg of this movement up. I am  bullish  up to 7.5k if  RSI  resistance can turn to support and we can break above the OBV level and see the bat fail. However  volume  is not exactly convincing and the precise levels on the bat  harmonic  means 6.7k is likely to be a very strong resistance.  

I am looking to add to my position at 6.3k where the cloud/daily open level can hold as support at what would be at the bottom of the flag. 

I would be stopped out of all long positions in profit below the weekly close level at 6.1k 

I want to short 6.7k or 7.5k. Nothing shows we will be breaking  bearish  market structure anytime soon

** IF LOOKING AT THIS PLEASE MINIMIZE YOUR SIDEBAR, AND MAXIMIZE THE CHART (OTHERWISE LINES WILL OVERLAP) ** 
In this lesson we will go over a form of motive wave that is not an impulse, a Diagonal Triangle! (referred to as either an  Ending Diagonal  or a  Leading Diagonal ) 

Leave a like if you wish to follow this series, every update will be posted below. 

If you are following this series I would suggest writing down what is shown in notes to help your brain remember these patterns, rules, guidelines and more.  Elliot Wave  theory is based on pattern recognition, and to recognize these patterns in real-time you must first remember them.  

We will next be going over corrective patterns (Reactionary) !

1530411572.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Short Squeeze As USD Peaks. Is This The Beginning?,"
 BTCUSD -0.41%  update: After the 6170 long trigger, price tested the 6431 to 6614 minor  resistance zone  quickly. This also happens to be where the  bearish trend line  is located. This type of price action is not a surprise since we have been writing about the high probability location for at least two weeks now. 

The 6K psychological support, reversal zone boundaries at 5956 and 5669 along with the 8171 to 4938 broad support have been the focus. At S.C. we have been building inventory and continue to look for long trades in these markets.  

What appears to be the key driver behind this surge in momentum is the U.S. Dollar. If you take a look at a larger time frame  Dollar Index -0.43%  chart, you will notice the same type of price action, but inverted. Instead of a failed low, you will observe a failed high. 

Interestingly enough, this reversal can been seen across forex pairs that counter the Dollar like EUR and GBP.  

Do not forget, the major coins trade against fiat, and the world reserve currency is still the USD. That means it carries the most weight. Any broad moves in the Dollar can have dramatic effects on these coins. 

If there is now a higher correlation to the USD, I want to be aware of it. For this reason I will be publishing a technical report on the USD on S.C. tomorrow so make sure to look for it. 

In summary, at S.C., we are waiting for the next swing trade entry long. Since  bearish  structures are still in play, a retrace is likely, but the probability of a subsequent higher low has increased. Any pull back into the 6K area, followed by a long trigger will prompt us to participate in another long trade idea.  

Stops and targets will continue to be conservative until broader  bearish  structures are taken out such as the 7381 resistance (.382 of current  bearish  structure).  

The probability of the broader location outweighs the smaller time frame noise. And it has been reiterating long over and over. Do not lose sight, especially if this market decides to retest the lows once more. The next pull back will either make or break the broader reversal that appears to be in progress.

In the last analyses I pointed out possible positive divergence by the  RSI  indicator which is a stronger sign for a bottom. With the  Bollinger Bands  indicator narrowing a bigger move may be on it's way, and wthis tiome it could go north. 

The best sign for this is when bulls can set a higher high on this  daily chart  (a move over the latest lower high around 6850). Expect an attempt for this if the downward sloping line gets taken out around 6510, first resistance.  

Support is seen at 5850 and could be seen if 6510 continues to see problems. A move over 6850 implies a run at the next downward sloping line, around 8300.

Entered long at 5913 on  bullish bat  forming 2 days ago, now we have a kumo cross,  TK              cross, cloud breakout and  RSI  breakout all  bullish . The OBV still cant get above the level that held as support since October 2017.  Bearish Bat  could possibly be forming as well after the next leg of this movement up. I am  bullish  up to 7.5k if  RSI  resistance can turn to support and we can break above the OBV level and see the bat fail. However  volume  is not exactly convincing and the precise levels on the bat  harmonic  means 6.7k is likely to be a very strong resistance.  

I am looking to add to my position at 6.3k where the cloud/daily open level can hold as support at what would be at the bottom of the flag. 

I would be stopped out of all long positions in profit below the weekly close level at 6.1k 

I want to short 6.7k or 7.5k. Nothing shows we will be breaking  bearish  market structure anytime soon

** IF LOOKING AT THIS PLEASE MINIMIZE YOUR SIDEBAR, AND MAXIMIZE THE CHART (OTHERWISE LINES WILL OVERLAP) ** 
In this lesson we will go over a form of motive wave that is not an impulse, a Diagonal Triangle! (referred to as either an  Ending Diagonal  or a  Leading Diagonal ) 

Leave a like if you wish to follow this series, every update will be posted below. 

If you are following this series I would suggest writing down what is shown in notes to help your brain remember these patterns, rules, guidelines and more.  Elliot Wave  theory is based on pattern recognition, and to recognize these patterns in real-time you must first remember them.  

We will next be going over corrective patterns (Reactionary) !

1530411572.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Short Squeeze As USD Peaks. Is This The Beginning?,"
 BTCUSD -0.49%  update: After the 6170 long trigger, price tested the 6431 to 6614 minor  resistance zone  quickly. This also happens to be where the  bearish trend line  is located. This type of price action is not a surprise since we have been writing about the high probability location for at least two weeks now. 

The 6K psychological support, reversal zone boundaries at 5956 and 5669 along with the 8171 to 4938 broad support have been the focus. At S.C. we have been building inventory and continue to look for long trades in these markets.  

What appears to be the key driver behind this surge in momentum is the U.S. Dollar. If you take a look at a larger time frame  Dollar Index -0.43%  chart, you will notice the same type of price action, but inverted. Instead of a failed low, you will observe a failed high. 

Interestingly enough, this reversal can been seen across forex pairs that counter the Dollar like EUR and GBP.  

Do not forget, the major coins trade against fiat, and the world reserve currency is still the USD. That means it carries the most weight. Any broad moves in the Dollar can have dramatic effects on these coins. 

If there is now a higher correlation to the USD, I want to be aware of it. For this reason I will be publishing a technical report on the USD on S.C. tomorrow so make sure to look for it. 

In summary, at S.C., we are waiting for the next swing trade entry long. Since  bearish  structures are still in play, a retrace is likely, but the probability of a subsequent higher low has increased. Any pull back into the 6K area, followed by a long trigger will prompt us to participate in another long trade idea.  

Stops and targets will continue to be conservative until broader  bearish  structures are taken out such as the 7381 resistance (.382 of current  bearish  structure).  

The probability of the broader location outweighs the smaller time frame noise. And it has been reiterating long over and over. Do not lose sight, especially if this market decides to retest the lows once more. The next pull back will either make or break the broader reversal that appears to be in progress.

In the last analyses I pointed out possible positive divergence by the  RSI  indicator which is a stronger sign for a bottom. With the  Bollinger Bands  indicator narrowing a bigger move may be on it's way, and wthis tiome it could go north. 

The best sign for this is when bulls can set a higher high on this  daily chart  (a move over the latest lower high around 6850). Expect an attempt for this if the downward sloping line gets taken out around 6510, first resistance.  

Support is seen at 5850 and could be seen if 6510 continues to see problems. A move over 6850 implies a run at the next downward sloping line, around 8300.

Entered long at 5913 on  bullish bat  forming 2 days ago, now we have a kumo cross,  TK              cross, cloud breakout and  RSI  breakout all  bullish . The OBV still cant get above the level that held as support since October 2017.  Bearish Bat  could possibly be forming as well after the next leg of this movement up. I am  bullish  up to 7.5k if  RSI  resistance can turn to support and we can break above the OBV level and see the bat fail. However  volume  is not exactly convincing and the precise levels on the bat  harmonic  means 6.7k is likely to be a very strong resistance.  

I am looking to add to my position at 6.3k where the cloud/daily open level can hold as support at what would be at the bottom of the flag. 

I would be stopped out of all long positions in profit below the weekly close level at 6.1k 

I want to short 6.7k or 7.5k. Nothing shows we will be breaking  bearish  market structure anytime soon

In this lesson we will go over a form of motive wave that is not an impulse, a Diagonal Triangle! (referred to as either an  Ending Diagonal  or a  Leading Diagonal ) 

Leave a like if you wish to follow this series, every update will be posted below. 

If you are following this series I would suggest writing down what is shown in notes to help your brain remember these patterns, rules, guidelines and more.  Elliot Wave  theory is based on pattern recognition, and to recognize these patterns in real-time you must first remember them.  

We will next be going over corrective patterns (Reactionary) !

1530411572.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Short Squeeze As USD Peaks. Is This The Beginning?,"
 BTCUSD -0.49%  update: After the 6170 long trigger, price tested the 6431 to 6614 minor  resistance zone  quickly. This also happens to be where the  bearish trend line  is located. This type of price action is not a surprise since we have been writing about the high probability location for at least two weeks now. 

The 6K psychological support, reversal zone boundaries at 5956 and 5669 along with the 8171 to 4938 broad support have been the focus. At S.C. we have been building inventory and continue to look for long trades in these markets.  

What appears to be the key driver behind this surge in momentum is the U.S. Dollar. If you take a look at a larger time frame  Dollar Index -0.43%  chart, you will notice the same type of price action, but inverted. Instead of a failed low, you will observe a failed high. 

Interestingly enough, this reversal can been seen across forex pairs that counter the Dollar like EUR and GBP.  

Do not forget, the major coins trade against fiat, and the world reserve currency is still the USD. That means it carries the most weight. Any broad moves in the Dollar can have dramatic effects on these coins. 

If there is now a higher correlation to the USD, I want to be aware of it. For this reason I will be publishing a technical report on the USD on S.C. tomorrow so make sure to look for it. 

In summary, at S.C., we are waiting for the next swing trade entry long. Since  bearish  structures are still in play, a retrace is likely, but the probability of a subsequent higher low has increased. Any pull back into the 6K area, followed by a long trigger will prompt us to participate in another long trade idea.  

Stops and targets will continue to be conservative until broader  bearish  structures are taken out such as the 7381 resistance (.382 of current  bearish  structure).  

The probability of the broader location outweighs the smaller time frame noise. And it has been reiterating long over and over. Do not lose sight, especially if this market decides to retest the lows once more. The next pull back will either make or break the broader reversal that appears to be in progress.

In the last analyses I pointed out possible positive divergence by the  RSI  indicator which is a stronger sign for a bottom. With the  Bollinger Bands  indicator narrowing a bigger move may be on it's way, and wthis tiome it could go north. 

The best sign for this is when bulls can set a higher high on this  daily chart  (a move over the latest lower high around 6850). Expect an attempt for this if the downward sloping line gets taken out around 6510, first resistance.  

Support is seen at 5850 and could be seen if 6510 continues to see problems. A move over 6850 implies a run at the next downward sloping line, around 8300.

Entered long at 5913 on  bullish bat  forming 2 days ago, now we have a kumo cross,  TK              cross, cloud breakout and  RSI  breakout all  bullish . The OBV still cant get above the level that held as support since October 2017.  Bearish Bat  could possibly be forming as well after the next leg of this movement up. I am  bullish  up to 7.5k if  RSI  resistance can turn to support and we can break above the OBV level and see the bat fail. However  volume  is not exactly convincing and the precise levels on the bat  harmonic  means 6.7k is likely to be a very strong resistance.  

I am looking to add to my position at 6.3k where the cloud/daily open level can hold as support at what would be at the bottom of the flag. 

I would be stopped out of all long positions in profit below the weekly close level at 6.1k 

I want to short 6.7k or 7.5k. Nothing shows we will be breaking  bearish  market structure anytime soon

1530411572.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Short Squeeze As USD Peaks. Is This The Beginning?,"
 BTCUSD              update: After the 6170 long trigger, price tested the 6431 to 6614 minor  resistance zone  quickly. This also happens to be where the  bearish trend line  is located. This type of price action is not a surprise since we have been writing about the high probability location for at least two weeks now. 

The 6K psychological support, reversal zone boundaries at 5956 and 5669 along with the 8171 to 4938 broad support have been the focus. At S.C. we have been building inventory and continue to look for long trades in these markets.  

What appears to be the key driver behind this surge in momentum is the U.S. Dollar. If you take a look at a larger time frame  Dollar Index              chart, you will notice the same type of price action, but inverted. Instead of a failed low, you will observe a failed high. 

Interestingly enough, this reversal can been seen across forex pairs that counter the Dollar like EUR and GBP.  

Do not forget, the major coins trade against fiat, and the world reserve currency is still the USD. That means it carries the most weight. Any broad moves in the Dollar can have dramatic effects on these coins. 

If there is now a higher correlation to the USD, I want to be aware of it. For this reason I will be publishing a technical report on the USD on S.C. tomorrow so make sure to look for it. 

In summary, at S.C., we are waiting for the next swing trade entry long. Since  bearish  structures are still in play, a retrace is likely, but the probability of a subsequent higher low has increased. Any pull back into the 6K area, followed by a long trigger will prompt us to participate in another long trade idea.  

Stops and targets will continue to be conservative until broader  bearish  structures are taken out such as the 7381 resistance (.382 of current  bearish  structure).  

The probability of the broader location outweighs the smaller time frame noise. And it has been reiterating long over and over. Do not lose sight, especially if this market decides to retest the lows once more. The next pull back will either make or break the broader reversal that appears to be in progress.

In the last analyses I pointed out possible positive divergence by the  RSI  indicator which is a stronger sign for a bottom. With the  Bollinger Bands  indicator narrowing a bigger move may be on it's way, and wthis tiome it could go north. 

The best sign for this is when bulls can set a higher high on this  daily chart  (a move over the latest lower high around 6850). Expect an attempt for this if the downward sloping line gets taken out around 6510, first resistance.  

Support is seen at 5850 and could be seen if 6510 continues to see problems. A move over 6850 implies a run at the next downward sloping line, around 8300.

Entered long at 5913 on  bullish bat  forming 2 days ago, now we have a kumo cross,  TK 1.57%  cross, cloud breakout and  RSI  breakout all  bullish . The OBV still cant get above the level that held as support since October 2017.  Bearish Bat  could possibly be forming as well after the next leg of this movement up. I am  bullish  up to 7.5k if  RSI  resistance can turn to support and we can break above the OBV level and see the bat fail. However  volume  is not exactly convincing and the precise levels on the bat  harmonic  means 6.7k is likely to be a very strong resistance.  

I am looking to add to my position at 6.3k where the cloud/daily open level can hold as support at what would be at the bottom of the flag. 

I would be stopped out of all long positions in profit below the weekly close level at 6.1k 

I want to short 6.7k or 7.5k. Nothing shows we will be breaking  bearish  market structure anytime soon

1530411572.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Short Squeeze As USD Peaks. Is This The Beginning?,"
 BTCUSD -0.45%  update: After the 6170 long trigger, price tested the 6431 to 6614 minor  resistance zone  quickly. This also happens to be where the  bearish trend line  is located. This type of price action is not a surprise since we have been writing about the high probability location for at least two weeks now. 

The 6K psychological support, reversal zone boundaries at 5956 and 5669 along with the 8171 to 4938 broad support have been the focus. At S.C. we have been building inventory and continue to look for long trades in these markets.  

What appears to be the key driver behind this surge in momentum is the U.S. Dollar. If you take a look at a larger time frame  Dollar Index -0.43%  chart, you will notice the same type of price action, but inverted. Instead of a failed low, you will observe a failed high. 

Interestingly enough, this reversal can been seen across forex pairs that counter the Dollar like EUR and GBP.  

Do not forget, the major coins trade against fiat, and the world reserve currency is still the USD. That means it carries the most weight. Any broad moves in the Dollar can have dramatic effects on these coins. 

If there is now a higher correlation to the USD, I want to be aware of it. For this reason I will be publishing a technical report on the USD on S.C. tomorrow so make sure to look for it. 

In summary, at S.C., we are waiting for the next swing trade entry long. Since  bearish  structures are still in play, a retrace is likely, but the probability of a subsequent higher low has increased. Any pull back into the 6K area, followed by a long trigger will prompt us to participate in another long trade idea.  

Stops and targets will continue to be conservative until broader  bearish  structures are taken out such as the 7381 resistance (.382 of current  bearish  structure).  

The probability of the broader location outweighs the smaller time frame noise. And it has been reiterating long over and over. Do not lose sight, especially if this market decides to retest the lows once more. The next pull back will either make or break the broader reversal that appears to be in progress.

In the last analyses I pointed out possible positive divergence by the  RSI  indicator which is a stronger sign for a bottom. With the  Bollinger Bands  indicator narrowing a bigger move may be on it's way, and wthis tiome it could go north. 

The best sign for this is when bulls can set a higher high on this  daily chart  (a move over the latest lower high around 6850). Expect an attempt for this if the downward sloping line gets taken out around 6510, first resistance.  

Support is seen at 5850 and could be seen if 6510 continues to see problems. A move over 6850 implies a run at the next downward sloping line, around 8300.

Entered long at 5913 on  bullish bat  forming 2 days ago, now we have a kumo cross,  TK 1.57%  cross, cloud breakout and  RSI  breakout all  bullish . The OBV still cant get above the level that held as support since October 2017.  Bearish Bat  could possibly be forming as well after the next leg of this movement up. I am  bullish  up to 7.5k if  RSI  resistance can turn to support and we can break above the OBV level and see the bat fail. However  volume  is not exactly convincing and the precise levels on the bat  harmonic  means 6.7k is likely to be a very strong resistance.  

I am looking to add to my position at 6.3k where the cloud/daily open level can hold as support at what would be at the bottom of the flag. 

I would be stopped out of all long positions in profit below the weekly close level at 6.1k 

I want to short 6.7k or 7.5k. Nothing shows we will be breaking  bearish  market structure anytime soon

I would be stopped out of all long positions in profit below the weekly close level at 6.1k 

I want to short 6.7k or 7.5k. Nothing shows we will be breaking  bearish  market structure anytime soon

Red  trend lines  represent the daily candles...showing us support.

1530411572.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Short Squeeze As USD Peaks. Is This The Beginning?,"
 BTCUSD -0.22%  update: After the 6170 long trigger, price tested the 6431 to 6614 minor  resistance zone  quickly. This also happens to be where the  bearish trend line  is located. This type of price action is not a surprise since we have been writing about the high probability location for at least two weeks now. 

The 6K psychological support, reversal zone boundaries at 5956 and 5669 along with the 8171 to 4938 broad support have been the focus. At S.C. we have been building inventory and continue to look for long trades in these markets.  

What appears to be the key driver behind this surge in momentum is the U.S. Dollar. If you take a look at a larger time frame  Dollar Index -0.43%  chart, you will notice the same type of price action, but inverted. Instead of a failed low, you will observe a failed high. 

Interestingly enough, this reversal can been seen across forex pairs that counter the Dollar like EUR and GBP.  

Do not forget, the major coins trade against fiat, and the world reserve currency is still the USD. That means it carries the most weight. Any broad moves in the Dollar can have dramatic effects on these coins. 

If there is now a higher correlation to the USD, I want to be aware of it. For this reason I will be publishing a technical report on the USD on S.C. tomorrow so make sure to look for it. 

In summary, at S.C., we are waiting for the next swing trade entry long. Since  bearish  structures are still in play, a retrace is likely, but the probability of a subsequent higher low has increased. Any pull back into the 6K area, followed by a long trigger will prompt us to participate in another long trade idea.  

Stops and targets will continue to be conservative until broader  bearish  structures are taken out such as the 7381 resistance (.382 of current  bearish  structure).  

The probability of the broader location outweighs the smaller time frame noise. And it has been reiterating long over and over. Do not lose sight, especially if this market decides to retest the lows once more. The next pull back will either make or break the broader reversal that appears to be in progress.

The best sign for this is when bulls can set a higher high on this  daily chart  (a move over the latest lower high around 6850). Expect an attempt for this if the downward sloping line gets taken out around 6510, first resistance.

Entered long at 5913 on  bullish bat  forming 2 days ago, now we have a kumo cross,  TK 1.57%  cross, cloud breakout and  RSI  breakout all  bullish . The OBV still cant get above the level that held as support since October 2017.  Bearish Bat  could possibly be forming as well after the next leg of this movement up. I am  bullish  up to 7.5k if  RSI  resistance can turn to support and we can break above the OBV level and see the bat fail. However  volume  is not exactly convincing and the precise levels on the bat  harmonic  means 6.7k is likely to be a very strong resistance.

The OBV still cant get above the level that held as support since October 2017.  Bearish Bat  could possibly be forming as well after the next leg of this movement up. I am  bullish  up to 7.5k if  RSI  resistance can turn to support and we can break above the OBV level and see the bat fail. However  volume  is not exactly convincing and the precise levels on the bat  harmonic  means 6.7k is likely to be a very strong resistance.  

I am looking to add to my position at 6.3k where the cloud/daily open level can hold as support at what would be at the bottom of the flag. 

I would be stopped out of all long positions in profit below the weekly close level at 6.1k 

I want to short 6.7k or 7.5k. Nothing shows we will be breaking  bearish  market structure anytime soon

Red  trend lines  represent the daily candles...showing us support. Blue = the 4hr candle  trend line ... on 4hr chart if new candle closes under blue resistance line we will probably go down to red support  trend line  and bounce back up from there, so its maybe a good idea to buy around that red line price around ($4800)...if we close above the blue line there is resistance at 6740, if we break over 6740 next resistance will be 7350

1530411572.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Short Squeeze As USD Peaks. Is This The Beginning?,"
 BTCUSD -0.21%  update: After the 6170 long trigger, price tested the 6431 to 6614 minor  resistance zone  quickly. This also happens to be where the  bearish trend line  is located. This type of price action is not a surprise since we have been writing about the high probability location for at least two weeks now. 

The 6K psychological support, reversal zone boundaries at 5956 and 5669 along with the 8171 to 4938 broad support have been the focus. At S.C. we have been building inventory and continue to look for long trades in these markets.  

What appears to be the key driver behind this surge in momentum is the U.S. Dollar. If you take a look at a larger time frame  Dollar Index -0.43%  chart, you will notice the same type of price action, but inverted. Instead of a failed low, you will observe a failed high. 

Interestingly enough, this reversal can been seen across forex pairs that counter the Dollar like EUR and GBP.  

Do not forget, the major coins trade against fiat, and the world reserve currency is still the USD. That means it carries the most weight. Any broad moves in the Dollar can have dramatic effects on these coins. 

If there is now a higher correlation to the USD, I want to be aware of it. For this reason I will be publishing a technical report on the USD on S.C. tomorrow so make sure to look for it. 

In summary, at S.C., we are waiting for the next swing trade entry long. Since  bearish  structures are still in play, a retrace is likely, but the probability of a subsequent higher low has increased. Any pull back into the 6K area, followed by a long trigger will prompt us to participate in another long trade idea.  

Stops and targets will continue to be conservative until broader  bearish  structures are taken out such as the 7381 resistance (.382 of current  bearish  structure).  

The probability of the broader location outweighs the smaller time frame noise. And it has been reiterating long over and over. Do not lose sight, especially if this market decides to retest the lows once more. The next pull back will either make or break the broader reversal that appears to be in progress.

In the last analyses I pointed out possible positive divergence by the  RSI  indicator which is a stronger sign for a bottom. With the  Bollinger Bands  indicator narrowing a bigger move may be on it's way, and wthis tiome it could go north. 

The best sign for this is when bulls can set a higher high on this  daily chart  (a move over the latest lower high around 6850). Expect an attempt for this if the downward sloping line gets taken out around 6510, first resistance.  

Support is seen at 5850 and could be seen if 6510 continues to see problems. A move over 6850 implies a run at the next downward sloping line, around 8300.
