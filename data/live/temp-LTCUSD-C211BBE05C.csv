1530688152.0,InvestingScope,Rejection on the 1D Lower High. Short.,"
LTC broke the 1H  Rectangle  but remained neutral on 4H ( RSI  = 53.129,  STOCH  = 53.528, Williams = -49.470) as despite the pattern break out, it was rejected off the Lower High (projevted yellow line) of the 1D Channel Down ( RSI  = 40.568,  MACD  = -7.614). This is still the commanding trend and fuelled by the  bearish  1W (Highs/Lows = -26.7750,  BBP              = -66.7800), Litecoin should hit the TP = 70.855 (November 29, 2017 contact point) soon. The downside potential is however bigger and technically it should continue lower, but ofcourse there will be updates prior.
