1530389621.0,SimonMercier,XRPUSD : possibility to retest 0.5 zone,"
HI guys, 
Got a demand to post my TA perspective on XRP. we have a 2  lvl 0.23%  impulse wave. 

Scenario a) retracement 







Scenario b) original post 

with test on a major resistance.  MACD  looking like it will crossover with an intrinseque  double bottom  normally indicate  bullish  outcome. We are now sitting on a major support and are on a compressive zone 







I do not exclude this count but its very unlikely how it is formed  







I dont exclude falling deeper if XRP cannot breach resistance and sell presusre resume : 







Overall the converging price toward his median mean that we are near a bottom zone
