Hi all  

I am giving a medium term view of  BTC -0.07%  analysis based on Tom  Demark  method .  
The idea here is for a short term swing trade . 
 In Tom  Demark  method past historical prices are meaning less and we focus only on recent prices . 
The forecasting method is dynamic means I am able to predict only till the next price point and nothing beyond it . 

Again I believe that market is full of technical analysts and not traders . People who love the rush by proving themselves right -"" I told ya so "" 

I am not that . I believe in your views and feedback - feel free to prove me wrong  . All I am doing is following the method I know and let it predict price actions . For a trader rather than being RIGHT , being DISCIPLINED is more important .

With weekly  volume  ( bullish  and  bearish ) dropping off since Dec '17, we have seen a  descending triangle  with three retests of the 5873 support line, with weakening buying pressure. The last two weeks seem to have broken the triangle  bullish . If we can get continuation of the trend, a push through the 12 & 26 week EMA's, and a cross-over of these EMA's, we may see a reversal of a 6 month down-trend. Bulls need to form a higher low and then a higher high, before this can happen, otherwise we may see a  bear flag , the confirmation of the  descending triangle , and a mid-term support turn into resistance.

Seems long overdue with  bearish volume  we have been suffering from all day. It looks like yesterdays pump was an attempt by the market makers to push us back up into the  bearish wedge  which failed. 

Previous targets are still the same.Though we found very weak support found on 30 minute time frame.  


When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement. 
I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations. As always be ready to play the market both ways whatever the market markers throw at us and beat them at their own game.

When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement. 
I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations. As always be ready to play the market both ways whatever the market markers throw at us and beat them at their own game.

With weekly  volume  ( bullish  and  bearish ) dropping off since Dec '17, we have seen a  descending triangle  with three retests of the 5873 support line, with weakening buying pressure. The last two weeks seem to have broken the triangle  bullish . If we can get continuation of the trend, a push through the 12 & 26 week EMA's, and a cross-over of these EMA's, we may see a reversal of a 6 month down-trend. Bulls need to form a higher low and then a higher high, before this can happen, otherwise we may see a  bear flag , the confirmation of the  descending triangle , and a mid-term support turn into resistance.

With weekly  volume  ( bullish  and  bearish ) dropping off since Dec '17, we have seen a  descending triangle  with three retests of the 5873 support line, with weakening buying pressure. The last two weeks seem to have broken the triangle  bullish . If we can get continuation of the trend, a push through the 12 & 26 week EMA's, and a cross-over of these EMA's, we may see a reversal of a 6 month down-trend. Bulls need to form a higher low and then a higher high, before this can happen, otherwise we may see a  bear flag , the confirmation of the  descending triangle , and a mid-term support turn into resistance.

Hi guys, 

BTCUSD -0.25%  7.8k target remain. 

The last time we discussed about  BTC -0.25%  we saw that form has changed to an ABCDE : 





 

I believe with the method that i apply to my TA that a little retracement  is likely to take place. 

Indicator remains positive and put a probable scenario of testing this hot zone after the little dip that im talking about :

Seems long overdue with  bearish volume  we have been suffering from all day. It looks like yesterdays pump was an attempt by the market makers to push us back up into the  bearish wedge  which failed. 

Previous targets are still the same.Though we found very weak support found on 30 minute time frame.  


When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement. 
I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations. As always be ready to play the market both ways whatever the market markers throw at us and beat them at their own game.

With weekly  volume  ( bullish  and  bearish ) dropping off since Dec '17, we have seen a  descending triangle  with three retests of the 5873 support line, with weakening buying pressure. The last two weeks seem to have broken the triangle  bullish . If we can get continuation of the trend, a push through the 12 & 26 week EMA's, and a cross-over of these EMA's, we may see a reversal of a 6 month down-trend. Bulls need to form a higher low and then a higher high, before this can happen, otherwise we may see a  bear flag , the confirmation of the  descending triangle , and a mid-term support turn into resistance.

Seems long overdue with  bearish volume  we have been suffering from all day. It looks like yesterdays pump was an attempt by the market makers to push us back up into the  bearish wedge  which failed. 

Previous targets are still the same.Though we found very weak support found on 30 minute time frame.  


When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement. 
I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations. As always be ready to play the market both ways whatever the market markers throw at us and beat them at their own game.

When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement. 
I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations. As always be ready to play the market both ways whatever the market markers throw at us and beat them at their own game.

With weekly  volume  ( bullish  and  bearish ) dropping off since Dec '17, we have seen a  descending triangle  with three retests of the 5873 support line, with weakening buying pressure. The last two weeks seem to have broken the triangle  bullish . If we can get continuation of the trend, a push through the 12 & 26 week EMA's, and a cross-over of these EMA's, we may see a reversal of a 6 month down-trend. Bulls need to form a higher low and then a higher high, before this can happen, otherwise we may see a  bear flag , the confirmation of the  descending triangle , and a mid-term support turn into resistance.

With weekly  volume  ( bullish  and  bearish ) dropping off since Dec '17, we have seen a  descending triangle  with three retests of the 5873 support line, with weakening buying pressure. The last two weeks seem to have broken the triangle  bullish . If we can get continuation of the trend, a push through the 12 & 26 week EMA's, and a cross-over of these EMA's, we may see a reversal of a 6 month down-trend. Bulls need to form a higher low and then a higher high, before this can happen, otherwise we may see a  bear flag , the confirmation of the  descending triangle , and a mid-term support turn into resistance.

Hi guys, 

BTCUSD              7.8k target remain. 

The last time we discussed about  BTC              we saw that form has changed to an ABCDE : 





 

I believe with the method that i apply to my TA that a little retracement  is likely to take place. 

Indicator remains positive and put a probable scenario of testing this hot zone after the little dip that im talking about :

Seems long overdue with  bearish volume  we have been suffering from all day. It looks like yesterdays pump was an attempt by the market makers to push us back up into the  bearish wedge  which failed. 

Previous targets are still the same.Though we found very weak support found on 30 minute time frame.  


When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement. 
I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations. As always be ready to play the market both ways whatever the market markers throw at us and beat them at their own game.

With weekly  volume  ( bullish  and  bearish ) dropping off since Dec '17, we have seen a  descending triangle  with three retests of the 5873 support line, with weakening buying pressure. The last two weeks seem to have broken the triangle  bullish . If we can get continuation of the trend, a push through the 12 & 26 week EMA's, and a cross-over of these EMA's, we may see a reversal of a 6 month down-trend. Bulls need to form a higher low and then a higher high, before this can happen, otherwise we may see a  bear flag , the confirmation of the  descending triangle , and a mid-term support turn into resistance.

Seems long overdue with  bearish volume  we have been suffering from all day. It looks like yesterdays pump was an attempt by the market makers to push us back up into the  bearish wedge  which failed. 

Previous targets are still the same.Though we found very weak support found on 30 minute time frame.  


When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement. 
I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations. As always be ready to play the market both ways whatever the market markers throw at us and beat them at their own game.

When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement. 
I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations. As always be ready to play the market both ways whatever the market markers throw at us and beat them at their own game.

I believe the price will still fall a little bit more until the general public sees it as a buying opportunity.

With weekly  volume  ( bullish  and  bearish ) dropping off since Dec '17, we have seen a  descending triangle  with three retests of the 5873 support line, with weakening buying pressure. The last two weeks seem to have broken the triangle  bullish . If we can get continuation of the trend, a push through the 12 & 26 week EMA's, and a cross-over of these EMA's, we may see a reversal of a 6 month down-trend. Bulls need to form a higher low and then a higher high, before this can happen, otherwise we may see a  bear flag , the confirmation of the  descending triangle , and a mid-term support turn into resistance.

With weekly  volume  ( bullish  and  bearish ) dropping off since Dec '17, we have seen a  descending triangle  with three retests of the 5873 support line, with weakening buying pressure. The last two weeks seem to have broken the triangle  bullish . If we can get continuation of the trend, a push through the 12 & 26 week EMA's, and a cross-over of these EMA's, we may see a reversal of a 6 month down-trend. Bulls need to form a higher low and then a higher high, before this can happen, otherwise we may see a  bear flag , the confirmation of the  descending triangle , and a mid-term support turn into resistance.

Hi guys, 

BTCUSD -0.13%  7.8k target remain. 

The last time we discussed about  BTC -0.13%  we saw that form has changed to an ABCDE : 





 

I believe with the method that i apply to my TA that a little retracement  is likely to take place. 

Indicator remains positive and put a probable scenario of testing this hot zone after the little dip that im talking about :

Seems long overdue with  bearish volume  we have been suffering from all day. It looks like yesterdays pump was an attempt by the market makers to push us back up into the  bearish wedge  which failed. 

Previous targets are still the same.Though we found very weak support found on 30 minute time frame.  


When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement. 
I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations. As always be ready to play the market both ways whatever the market markers throw at us and beat them at their own game.

With weekly  volume  ( bullish  and  bearish ) dropping off since Dec '17, we have seen a  descending triangle  with three retests of the 5873 support line, with weakening buying pressure. The last two weeks seem to have broken the triangle  bullish . If we can get continuation of the trend, a push through the 12 & 26 week EMA's, and a cross-over of these EMA's, we may see a reversal of a 6 month down-trend. Bulls need to form a higher low and then a higher high, before this can happen, otherwise we may see a  bear flag , the confirmation of the  descending triangle , and a mid-term support turn into resistance.

Seems long overdue with  bearish volume  we have been suffering from all day. It looks like yesterdays pump was an attempt by the market makers to push us back up into the  bearish wedge  which failed. 

Previous targets are still the same.Though we found very weak support found on 30 minute time frame.  


When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement. 
I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations. As always be ready to play the market both ways whatever the market markers throw at us and beat them at their own game.

When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement. 
I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations. As always be ready to play the market both ways whatever the market markers throw at us and beat them at their own game.

 Bitcoin              could still bottom at 4k support before reversal since the market is getting with a bear mindset it sparkes the possibility of a reversal soon. I believe the price will still fall a little bit more until the general public sees it as a buying opportunity.

With weekly  volume  ( bullish  and  bearish ) dropping off since Dec '17, we have seen a  descending triangle  with three retests of the 5873 support line, with weakening buying pressure. The last two weeks seem to have broken the triangle  bullish . If we can get continuation of the trend, a push through the 12 & 26 week EMA's, and a cross-over of these EMA's, we may see a reversal of a 6 month down-trend. Bulls need to form a higher low and then a higher high, before this can happen, otherwise we may see a  bear flag , the confirmation of the  descending triangle , and a mid-term support turn into resistance.

With weekly  volume  ( bullish  and  bearish ) dropping off since Dec '17, we have seen a  descending triangle  with three retests of the 5873 support line, with weakening buying pressure. The last two weeks seem to have broken the triangle  bullish . If we can get continuation of the trend, a push through the 12 & 26 week EMA's, and a cross-over of these EMA's, we may see a reversal of a 6 month down-trend. Bulls need to form a higher low and then a higher high, before this can happen, otherwise we may see a  bear flag , the confirmation of the  descending triangle , and a mid-term support turn into resistance.

Hi guys, 

BTCUSD -0.13%  7.8k target remain. 

The last time we discussed about  BTC -0.13%  we saw that form has changed to an ABCDE : 





 

I believe with the method that i apply to my TA that a little retracement  is likely to take place. 

Indicator remains positive and put a probable scenario of testing this hot zone after the little dip that im talking about :

Seems long overdue with  bearish volume  we have been suffering from all day. It looks like yesterdays pump was an attempt by the market makers to push us back up into the  bearish wedge  which failed. 

Previous targets are still the same.Though we found very weak support found on 30 minute time frame.  


When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement. 
I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations. As always be ready to play the market both ways whatever the market markers throw at us and beat them at their own game.

With weekly  volume  ( bullish  and  bearish ) dropping off since Dec '17, we have seen a  descending triangle  with three retests of the 5873 support line, with weakening buying pressure. The last two weeks seem to have broken the triangle  bullish . If we can get continuation of the trend, a push through the 12 & 26 week EMA's, and a cross-over of these EMA's, we may see a reversal of a 6 month down-trend. Bulls need to form a higher low and then a higher high, before this can happen, otherwise we may see a  bear flag , the confirmation of the  descending triangle , and a mid-term support turn into resistance.

Seems long overdue with  bearish volume  we have been suffering from all day. It looks like yesterdays pump was an attempt by the market makers to push us back up into the  bearish wedge  which failed. 

Previous targets are still the same.Though we found very weak support found on 30 minute time frame.  


When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement. 
I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations. As always be ready to play the market both ways whatever the market markers throw at us and beat them at their own game.

When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement. 
I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations. As always be ready to play the market both ways whatever the market markers throw at us and beat them at their own game.

I believe the price will still fall a little bit more until the general public sees it as a buying opportunity.

With weekly  volume  ( bullish  and  bearish ) dropping off since Dec '17, we have seen a  descending triangle  with three retests of the 5873 support line, with weakening buying pressure. The last two weeks seem to have broken the triangle  bullish . If we can get continuation of the trend, a push through the 12 & 26 week EMA's, and a cross-over of these EMA's, we may see a reversal of a 6 month down-trend. Bulls need to form a higher low and then a higher high, before this can happen, otherwise we may see a  bear flag , the confirmation of the  descending triangle , and a mid-term support turn into resistance.

With weekly  volume  ( bullish  and  bearish ) dropping off since Dec '17, we have seen a  descending triangle  with three retests of the 5873 support line, with weakening buying pressure. The last two weeks seem to have broken the triangle  bullish . If we can get continuation of the trend, a push through the 12 & 26 week EMA's, and a cross-over of these EMA's, we may see a reversal of a 6 month down-trend. Bulls need to form a higher low and then a higher high, before this can happen, otherwise we may see a  bear flag , the confirmation of the  descending triangle , and a mid-term support turn into resistance.

Hi guys, 

BTCUSD -0.17%  7.8k target remain. 

The last time we discussed about  BTC -0.17%  we saw that form has changed to an ABCDE : 





 

I believe with the method that i apply to my TA that a little retracement  is likely to take place. 

Indicator remains positive and put a probable scenario of testing this hot zone after the little dip that im talking about :

Seems long overdue with  bearish volume  we have been suffering from all day. It looks like yesterdays pump was an attempt by the market makers to push us back up into the  bearish wedge  which failed. 

Previous targets are still the same.Though we found very weak support found on 30 minute time frame.  


When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement. 
I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations. As always be ready to play the market both ways whatever the market markers throw at us and beat them at their own game.

Clearly, our first (X) Wave is a  flat correction  3-3-5.  

B retraces deep to area around the 0.854 level.  
Length of C wave is practically the same of A.

1531098385.0,edjunkmailbox,BTC USD analysis - which way are we going ?,"
Hi all  

I am giving a medium term view of  BTC -0.11%  analysis based on Tom  Demark  method .  
The idea here is for a short term swing trade . 
 In Tom  Demark  method past historical prices are meaning less and we focus only on recent prices . 
The forecasting method is dynamic means I am able to predict only till the next price point and nothing beyond it . 

Again I believe that market is full of technical analysts and not traders . People who love the rush by proving themselves right -"" I told ya so "" 

I am not that . I believe in your views and feedback - feel free to prove me wrong  . All I am doing is following the method I know and let it predict price actions . For a trader rather than being RIGHT , being DISCIPLINED is more important .

Potentially a repeat of the 3rd. I think we've hit a valley and it's going to go sideways for a little bit, then pump up again to meet the previous tend's levels or slightly higher, then drop through the floor.

1531089096.0,AzzAChang,Mid-term Overview - Weekly descending triangle breakout?? ,"
With weekly  volume  ( bullish  and  bearish ) dropping off since Dec '17, we have seen a  descending triangle  with three retests of the 5873 support line, with weakening buying pressure. The last two weeks seem to have broken the triangle  bullish . If we can get continuation of the trend, a push through the 12 & 26 week EMA's, and a cross-over of these EMA's, we may see a reversal of a 6 month down-trend. Bulls need to form a higher low and then a higher high, before this can happen, otherwise we may see a  bear flag , the confirmation of the  descending triangle , and a mid-term support turn into resistance.

Not sure if this is a legit analysis, but this is the pattern I see. There will be a wave down, as always, but overall I believe we just entered a slow/steady bull cycle. We are on our way up!!! 
Let's see if this works out, sure hope so! :)

I'm seeing that my supports are holding and while we are having a slight pullback, I'm not sure I agree with my colleagues who are calling for a mass dump to $6K. I do think we will see a pull back to the $6600 area, but not sure if it will break through that.

1531094628.0,SimonMercier,BTCUSD : 7.8k target remains,"
Hi guys, 

BTCUSD -0.11%  7.8k target remain. 

The last time we discussed about  BTC -0.11%  we saw that form has changed to an ABCDE : 





 

I believe with the method that i apply to my TA that a little retracement  is likely to take place. 

Indicator remains positive and put a probable scenario of testing this hot zone after the little dip that im talking about :

1531094381.0,achtung360,Bearish on all long time frames. Volume lacking.,"
Seems long overdue with  bearish volume  we have been suffering from all day. It looks like yesterdays pump was an attempt by the market makers to push us back up into the  bearish wedge  which failed. 

Previous targets are still the same.Though we found very weak support found on 30 minute time frame.  


When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement. 
I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations. As always be ready to play the market both ways whatever the market markers throw at us and beat them at their own game.

I showed a grid of lines of supports and resistances. Also showed horizontal levels. Now we are moving into the blue  uptrend channel  and already we see an  rising wedge  - a reversal figure. The market is highly manipulated. may grow a little more, but we still fall globally.

1531087109.0,cusspvz,Bitcoin could still bottom at 4k support before reversal,"
 Bitcoin -0.11%  could still bottom at 4k support before reversal since the market is getting with a bear mindset it sparkes the possibility of a reversal soon. I believe the price will still fall a little bit more until the general public sees it as a buying opportunity. Since the last buying opportunity was at near 6k, and in spite we're not so far away from it, there aren't any major bull micro trends, I see it as a flag that we're still going to bottom.
