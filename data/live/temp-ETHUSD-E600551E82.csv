1530582311.0,cryptogast33,ETHUSD When Orca whales eat Whales,"
Probably one of the more promising cryptos, in my top 5 of alts. Wait for the longs to be wiped out for a potential bottom. 

Forgot to add a strong SR @ $6. It probably will be the most strongest support, since it's already tested good, unlike any higher horizontal support line, but I doubt it will go there, $6 is pretty much a steal in my view.

Looks to me like an expand flat going, it measures perfectly and A and B are both three wave moves, keep your stops tight. Im long too from 415 area took some profit just under 480, target 480-486 if this is a Wave 4.

Things to note: 

1. Volume profile  indicator showing the point of control as a solid  support level . 
2. Daily oversold  RSI  favours the bull case. 
3. Descending  wedge  structure - common  bullish  reversal pattern - testing the top of the trend-line now. 
4.  Elliot Wave  count gets the checkmark.  
5. The 23.6 fib on the major move looks like a promising TP target 1 

If ETH does get the  bullish  reversal, you can expect the entire crypto market to see some nice moves -  BTC              likely rallying into the low 7's. I would sure love to see it. 

Best of luck.

1530557506.0,rajista,"#Ethereum ew count, #eth will break 20DMA or not? #crypto $eth","
#Ethereum  bearish  count considering that we are in the  ending diagonal  C in  ABC  subwave of wave Z in an  overall WXYZ correction since january 2018 high.  







This count will be valid if eth doesn't manage to break above the 20DMA resistance level:477 with conviction. 

20 DMA resitance has been a strong  resistance level  for  ethereum 0.10%  so far. 

Earlier eth bounced from the 200ema support in 3D t-f and is facing 9ema resistance in 3D t-f 







Bullish scenario: On the other hand if ether manages to break above the 20DMA level then next it will look to target the 50DMA at 577. 

In this scenario the bearish count will be invalidated and we will be seeing a 1-5 subwave of the larger A wave in an  ABC  correction upwards with the subwave 5 count around the 50DMA resistance 560-580 








Now since  btc 0.19%  is volatile right now and the alts are heavily dependent on btc's movement so lets see what aprrox btc's movement can lead to the above  2 ew counts from  ethereum 0.10% .
