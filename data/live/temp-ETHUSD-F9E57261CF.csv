 Ethereum 3.77%  has perfectly followed my previous analysis, so well done to all who followed the analysis and profited from it! Price hit a horizontal  support zone , and then bounced up to the side-wards resistance. (See related ideas for more details of this idea). The idea played out to the end, and now it is time to update this analysis so we can further track Ethereum's movements to maximize our profits. 

At present price completed a measure move target for a  bearish flag  pattern which hit a horizontal support between 405 and 394 and then price aggressively bounced since. Price is now approaching side-wards resistance, which coincides with a horizontal  support/resistance  transition level. 

There is 2 ways that price will now act: 

1: Price will bounce at the  support/resistance  transition zone between 463 ad 476 before bouncing down lower towards swing low at 405 and 394 before the next bounce. The  support/resistance  level also coincides with side-wards resistance, so this is likely a strong resistance ceiling that definitely needs to be watched out for. 

2: Price breaks the side-wards  support/resistance  transition level, and the side-wards  resistance level , breaks to the upside target at 512. 

Bear in mind that if scenario 2 plays out, that when the side-wards  support/resistance  transition zone will likely end up being retested as a new  support zone  before the upside move begins. 

I will continue to update this analysis if it gets enough views/likes. 

Please leave a LIKE and follow. I'd really appreciate it. :-)
