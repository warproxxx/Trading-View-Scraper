1530086425.0,VARZAR_INVESTMENT,Trading plan: XRPUSD (Ripple),"
The Ripple rate has rolled back down, but still remains in flat. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on XRPUSD. 
We expect today to see a small increase in the rate of Ripple to $ 0.50. It is not the best place to look for the deals: the downward trend, so it is too early to buy Ripple. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.45 to $ 0.50. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will drop from $ 0.45 to $ 0.40. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ripple in flat is quite possible for the rest of the day.
