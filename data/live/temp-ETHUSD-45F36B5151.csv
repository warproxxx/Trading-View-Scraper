1530507622.0,CryptoComes,ETH/USD Bulls Finally Find Support,"
The whole crypto market celebrates  Facebook -0.97%  decision as  Ethereum -1.10%  has made his way upwards on Saturday following  Bitcoin -0.59% . ETH/USD has almost no changes in the past 24 hours, but the momentum during the weekend was huge. The currency pair seems to change its moods to positive. 

When we look closer at the Hourly chart we can see that  Ethereum -1.10%  has crossed $417.28, $431.42 resistance areas and is currently testing $453.24  resistance area . We have a  Flag pattern  here as well meaning bulls have chances to drive the currency pair even higher, targeting the next resistance at $473.29.  
If buyers will be able to reach this green flag area, they will test it and once successful, they will be able to drive ETH/USD higher. 
However, we advise to pay attention to the red flag as well. If the  Flag pattern  fails to develop, the price will fall towards the  support area  at $431.42.

1530500406.0,MarcPMarkets,ETHUSD: Bearish Trigger Near But Higher Low Likely To Form.,"
 ETHUSD -1.10%  update:  Inside bar  has materialized which sets the stage for the next move in this market. With the  bearish  structure still intact, an attempt toward the 392 reversal zone boundary is likely. The structure to watch for though is a higher low formation between current prices and 392. This would be the  bullish  confirmation that a broader movement toward higher prices is in progress. 

I wrote in my previous reports that the recent short squeeze in these markets could be the beginning of a broader move higher. The general price area of these markets, especially  BTC -0.59% , present reward/risk scenarios that are skewed toward the  bullish  side.  

And part of the motivation that can help these markets along can come from a weakening Dollar. I published an article earlier on S.C. that explored this relationship further. 

At this point, ETH as well as  BTC -0.59%  are facing the first  bearish  obstacle. The mid 440's is where the  bearish trend line  is located as well as the lower boundary of the broad 544 to 464  support zone  (.618 area of recent  bullish  structure). If price breaks back below the low 440s, it will be generating a sell trigger and can lead to a retest of the 400 low. 

If 400 is taken out, 392 is the next reversal zone boundary relative to the 404 low. That is the location to look for reversal candles like a  bullish pin bar . 

A close below 392 opens the possibility for the test of 374 which would be a  bearish  sign to say the least. As S.C., we are anticipating the higher low scenario because of the magnitude of the initial spike on Friday. 

In summary, if the higher low can materialize, it would justify a swing trade long idea (which will be shared with followers on S.C. if we take it). A push off a higher low can take price back into the low 500's at least.  

If price action stays tight, it can also form a shallow higher low and squeeze earlier than expected. This would be a higher risk trade because of the general lack of follow through and  bearish  obstacles still in play. In this scenario, we will wait it out until the  trend line  is at least cleared before considering such aggressive setups.  

You will be in the game longer if your biggest mistakes are missing trades, rather than forcing trades. Missing a trade does not drain your capital, while forced trades drain it quickly. Just something to think about.

1530492041.0,Coin_Analyst,Ethereum bulls (ETHUSD) not backing down,"
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a quick review that captures over 6 months of price action in  Ethereum -1.05%  starting from the beginning of the collapse in price in January till present date. The following numbers indicated on the chart are discussed below: 

(1) The major  bearish trendline  in  Ethereum -1.05%  ( ETHUSD -1.05% ) after a price close of ~$1379.90 on January 13, 2018. Price closing above ~$644.43 is the most conservative entry point into a long (buy) position identified in this analysis. 

(2) A price close above the green  bearish trendline  is less conservative than in (1) above. This calls for entry into a  bullish  position once price breaks the  bearish trendline  at ~$471.55.  Trendlines  (2) starting from $807.65 on May 6, 2018 is used in this analysis as part of the process of monitoring the evolution of the  bearish trend  in  Ethereum -1.05% . 

(3) This range lies between ~$407.64 and ~$349.18. This range =  support level  1 and is expected to provide support for  Ethereum -1.05%  ( ETHUSD -1.05% ). 

(4) Price breaking through  support level  1 will be expected to find support between ~$289.60 and ~$229.59 which marks the boundaries for  support level  2. 

(5) The  relative strength index  ( RSI ) is shown here with a negative slope. A break above the falling slope and also price action breaking above the green  bearish trendline  will provide a great confirmation signal to buy  Ethereum -1.05% . Also of important notice is that the current  pivot  in  Ethereum -1.05%  with the previous low does form a  bullish divergence  with the  RSI .  
This implies that the bears are running out of momentum and therefore a  bullish  move is possible. 
Based on the principles of prices remaining range bound, any breakout in price to the upside would be expected to at least return back to the start of the  bearish trendline  in green (2) which is ~$807.65.
