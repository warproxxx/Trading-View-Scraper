Currently,  bitcoin 0.46%  is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin 0.46%  during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Looking at the choppy legs up, the  RSI  shows it is overbought, retracement to around fib level of 0.3-0.5 or 6.3k is expected. although a final leg towards higher 6.7k might happen before the dump.  

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before. 

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.46%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr 2.16% RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr 2.16% rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions. 

We see an ascending  wedge . Last two proved  bearish .

Bullish  signals:

on the daily  volume  is slightly increasing. 

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.  

Assumptions: 
This ""spring"" regarding Wyckoff accumulation  TR 0.64%  happened on such a small time frame I don't think Market Makers gathered enough information to push forth another bull run. Market reputation still hurting too much and there is still plenty of logarithmic room for prices to drop further. This is a very impatient market, for mass adoption a 1 week long spring is not long enough. 4500 - 5000: these are the prices Market Makers could really take advantage of during panic sell, accumulating over a longer period, holding prices up long enough to establish faith in the market again that it has stabilised at a ""bottom"".  

Positions to take: 1) short on low leverage. 2) stack with higher leverage or smaller stacks pushing liquidation up to 7k or 7,2 to be quite safe.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays 0.00%  push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC 0.52%  hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin 0.52%  will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.  

I am going to do a more detailed  Bitcoin 0.52%  analysis this week, stay tuned!!

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before. 

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.65%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr             RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr             rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions.

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays 0.00%  push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC 0.69%  hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin 0.69%  will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.  

I am going to do a more detailed  Bitcoin 0.69%  analysis this week, stay tuned!!

Currently,  bitcoin 0.69%  is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin 0.69%  during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Reason for the trading strategy (technically): 
BTCUSD 0.55%  reversed nicely off its resistance at 6760 (50%  Fibonacci retracement , 61.8%  Fibonacci extension , horizontal swing high resistance) where we expect price to fall to its support at 6294 (50%  Fibonacci retracement , horizontal overlap support).  
Stochastic  (89, 5, 3) reversed nicely off its resistance at 95% where a corresponding drop is expected. We have also identified a  bearish  divergence with price which contributes to our  bearish  bias.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays              push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC              hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin              will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.

Currently,  bitcoin              is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin              during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Looking at the choppy legs up, the  RSI  shows it is overbought, retracement to around fib level of 0.3-0.5 or 6.3k is expected. although a final leg towards higher 6.7k might happen before the dump.  

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before. 

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.59%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr             RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr             rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions.

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays              push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC 0.53%  hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin 0.53%  will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.  

I am going to do a more detailed  Bitcoin 0.53%  analysis this week, stay tuned!!

 Just thought I’d share. The more the market shows me it’s hand, the more  bullish  I think it’s hidden intentions are. Here’s what I’m currently seeing (for now). I’m going long soon after my RSI/CCI looks favorable to ride a wave 1 of a wave 5 up.

Currently,  bitcoin 0.53%  is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin 0.53%  during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Looking at the choppy legs up, the  RSI  shows it is overbought, retracement to around fib level of 0.3-0.5 or 6.3k is expected. although a final leg towards higher 6.7k might happen before the dump.  

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before. 

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.53%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr             RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr             rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions. 

We see an ascending  wedge . Last two proved  bearish .  
Possible  H&S  forming. Doesn't matter if legitimate, it is obvious enough for people to see it's possibility.  

Bullish  signals: 
price broke major channel resistance. Zoom out on the chart to see. 
on the daily  volume  is slightly increasing. 

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.  

Assumptions: 
This ""spring"" regarding Wyckoff accumulation  TR 0.64%  happened on such a small time frame I don't think Market Makers gathered enough information to push forth another bull run. Market reputation still hurting too much and there is still plenty of logarithmic room for prices to drop further. This is a very impatient market, for mass adoption a 1 week long spring is not long enough. 4500 - 5000: these are the prices Market Makers could really take advantage of during panic sell, accumulating over a longer period, holding prices up long enough to establish faith in the market again that it has stabilised at a ""bottom"".  

Positions to take: 1) short on low leverage. 2) stack with higher leverage or smaller stacks pushing liquidation up to 7k or 7,2 to be quite safe.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Looking at the choppy legs up, the  RSI  shows it is overbought, retracement to around fib level of 0.3-0.5 or 6.3k is expected. although a final leg towards higher 6.7k might happen before the dump.  

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before. 

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.46%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr 2.16% RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr 2.16% rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions. 

We see an ascending  wedge . Last two proved  bearish .

Bullish  signals: 
price broke major channel resistance. Zoom out on the chart to see. 
on the daily  volume  is slightly increasing. 

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.  

Assumptions: 
This ""spring"" regarding Wyckoff accumulation  TR              happened on such a small time frame I don't think Market Makers gathered enough information to push forth another bull run. Market reputation still hurting too much and there is still plenty of logarithmic room for prices to drop further. This is a very impatient market, for mass adoption a 1 week long spring is not long enough. 4500 - 5000: these are the prices Market Makers could really take advantage of during panic sell, accumulating over a longer period, holding prices up long enough to establish faith in the market again that it has stabilised at a ""bottom"".  

Positions to take: 1) short on low leverage. 2) stack with higher leverage or smaller stacks pushing liquidation up to 7k or 7,2 to be quite safe.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays              push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC              hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin              will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays              push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC              hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin              will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.  

I am going to do a more detailed  Bitcoin              analysis this week, stay tuned!!

Currently,  bitcoin 0.38%  is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin 0.38%  during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Looking at the choppy legs up, the  RSI  shows it is overbought, retracement to around fib level of 0.3-0.5 or 6.3k is expected. although a final leg towards higher 6.7k might happen before the dump.  

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility).

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays 0.00%  push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC 0.36%  hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin 0.36%  will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.  

I am going to do a more detailed  Bitcoin 0.36%  analysis this week, stay tuned!!

Currently,  bitcoin 0.36%  is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin 0.36%  during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Looking at the choppy legs up, the  RSI  shows it is overbought, retracement to around fib level of 0.3-0.5 or 6.3k is expected. although a final leg towards higher 6.7k might happen before the dump.  

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before. 

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.36%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr             RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr             rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions. 

We see an ascending  wedge . Last two proved  bearish .

Bullish  signals:

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays 0.00%  push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC 0.51%  hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin 0.51%  will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.  

I am going to do a more detailed  Bitcoin 0.51%  analysis this week, stay tuned!!

 Just thought I’d share. The more the market shows me it’s hand, the more  bullish  I think it’s hidden intentions are. Here’s what I’m currently seeing (for now). I’m going long soon after my RSI/CCI looks favorable to ride a wave 1 of a wave 5 up.

Currently,  bitcoin 0.51%  is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin 0.51%  during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Looking at the choppy legs up, the  RSI  shows it is overbought, retracement to around fib level of 0.3-0.5 or 6.3k is expected. although a final leg towards higher 6.7k might happen before the dump.  

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before. 

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.51%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr 2.16% RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr 2.16% rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions. 

We see an ascending  wedge . Last two proved  bearish .  
Possible  H&S  forming. Doesn't matter if legitimate, it is obvious enough for people to see it's possibility.  

Bullish  signals: 
price broke major channel resistance. Zoom out on the chart to see. 
on the daily  volume  is slightly increasing. 

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.  

Assumptions: 
This ""spring"" regarding Wyckoff accumulation  TR 0.64%  happened on such a small time frame I don't think Market Makers gathered enough information to push forth another bull run. Market reputation still hurting too much and there is still plenty of logarithmic room for prices to drop further. This is a very impatient market, for mass adoption a 1 week long spring is not long enough. 4500 - 5000: these are the prices Market Makers could really take advantage of during panic sell, accumulating over a longer period, holding prices up long enough to establish faith in the market again that it has stabilised at a ""bottom"".  

Positions to take: 1) short on low leverage. 2) stack with higher leverage or smaller stacks pushing liquidation up to 7k or 7,2 to be quite safe.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Looking at the choppy legs up, the  RSI  shows it is overbought, retracement to around fib level of 0.3-0.5 or 6.3k is expected. although a final leg towards higher 6.7k might happen before the dump.  

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before. 

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.51%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions.

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays              push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC              hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin              will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.

Currently,  bitcoin 0.51%  is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin 0.51%  during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred.

 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr 2.16% RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr 2.16% rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions.

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays 0.00%  push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC 0.73%  hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin 0.73%  will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.  

I am going to do a more detailed  Bitcoin 0.73%  analysis this week, stay tuned!!

Currently,  bitcoin 0.73%  is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin 0.73%  during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Looking at the choppy legs up, the  RSI  shows it is overbought, retracement to around fib level of 0.3-0.5 or 6.3k is expected. although a final leg towards higher 6.7k might happen before the dump.  

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before. 

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.74%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays              push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC 0.73%  hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin 0.73%  will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.  

I am going to do a more detailed  Bitcoin 0.73%  analysis this week, stay tuned!!

I’m going long soon after my RSI/CCI looks favorable to ride a wave 1 of a wave 5 up.

Currently,  bitcoin 0.73%  is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin 0.73%  during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Looking at the choppy legs up, the  RSI  shows it is overbought, retracement to around fib level of 0.3-0.5 or 6.3k is expected. although a final leg towards higher 6.7k might happen before the dump.  

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before. 

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.73%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr 2.16% RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr 2.16% rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions. 

We see an ascending  wedge . Last two proved  bearish .  
Possible  H&S  forming. Doesn't matter if legitimate, it is obvious enough for people to see it's possibility.  

Bullish  signals: 
price broke major channel resistance. Zoom out on the chart to see. 
on the daily  volume  is slightly increasing. 

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.  

Assumptions: 
This ""spring"" regarding Wyckoff accumulation  TR 0.64%  happened on such a small time frame I don't think Market Makers gathered enough information to push forth another bull run. Market reputation still hurting too much and there is still plenty of logarithmic room for prices to drop further. This is a very impatient market, for mass adoption a 1 week long spring is not long enough. 4500 - 5000: these are the prices Market Makers could really take advantage of during panic sell, accumulating over a longer period, holding prices up long enough to establish faith in the market again that it has stabilised at a ""bottom"".  

Positions to take: 1) short on low leverage. 2) stack with higher leverage or smaller stacks pushing liquidation up to 7k or 7,2 to be quite safe.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays 0.00%  push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC 0.54%  hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin 0.54%  will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.  

I am going to do a more detailed  Bitcoin 0.54%  analysis this week, stay tuned!!

I’m going long soon after my RSI/CCI looks favorable to ride a wave 1 of a wave 5 up.

Currently,  bitcoin 0.54%  is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin 0.54%  during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Looking at the choppy legs up, the  RSI  shows it is overbought, retracement to around fib level of 0.3-0.5 or 6.3k is expected. although a final leg towards higher 6.7k might happen before the dump.  

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before. 

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.54%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr             RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr             rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions. 

We see an ascending  wedge . Last two proved  bearish .  
Possible  H&S  forming. Doesn't matter if legitimate, it is obvious enough for people to see it's possibility.  

Bullish  signals: 
price broke major channel resistance. Zoom out on the chart to see. 
on the daily  volume  is slightly increasing. 

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.  

Assumptions: 
This ""spring"" regarding Wyckoff accumulation  TR 0.64%  happened on such a small time frame I don't think Market Makers gathered enough information to push forth another bull run. Market reputation still hurting too much and there is still plenty of logarithmic room for prices to drop further. This is a very impatient market, for mass adoption a 1 week long spring is not long enough. 4500 - 5000: these are the prices Market Makers could really take advantage of during panic sell, accumulating over a longer period, holding prices up long enough to establish faith in the market again that it has stabilised at a ""bottom"".  

Positions to take: 1) short on low leverage. 2) stack with higher leverage or smaller stacks pushing liquidation up to 7k or 7,2 to be quite safe.

Comment:
					bearish signals:  
200ema on 4hr has showed up as resistance. though on the 1 hour price has broken above it. 
bullish signals: 
CMF shows there's still a lot of buying pressure keeping the price up putting pressure on short positions in this range to pull out causing a small spike into heavier bear territory. Possibility to see 6800 again before going down. 
If price is able to stabilise on the blue rectangle with current orders taking profits or closing, another bull rally will be likely. 

Conclusion: I would not look to open a short position if I saw a 4hr candle open and close above the 4h 200ema. But with major resistance at 7k, where I believe there's a lot of supply waiting to get out of btc, I would not FOMO into a long here either. Only a break above the low 7k zone would confirm for a bull rally to 8k, 9k. 
A drop at this point down to 6300 - 6180 support zone will build pressure in the channel, as the support line forms a triangle with the channel resistance. This support is weak and without a strong market incentive will collapse against the more dominant downward trend.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave.

Currently,  bitcoin 0.54%  is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin 0.54%  during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Looking at the choppy legs up, the  RSI  shows it is overbought, retracement to around fib level of 0.3-0.5 or 6.3k is expected. although a final leg towards higher 6.7k might happen before the dump.  

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before. 

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.54%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr 2.16% RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr 2.16% rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions. 

We see an ascending  wedge . Last two proved  bearish .  
Possible  H&S  forming. Doesn't matter if legitimate, it is obvious enough for people to see it's possibility.  

Bullish  signals: 
price broke major channel resistance. Zoom out on the chart to see. 
on the daily  volume  is slightly increasing. 

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.  

Assumptions: 
This ""spring"" regarding Wyckoff accumulation  TR 0.64%  happened on such a small time frame I don't think Market Makers gathered enough information to push forth another bull run. Market reputation still hurting too much and there is still plenty of logarithmic room for prices to drop further. This is a very impatient market, for mass adoption a 1 week long spring is not long enough. 4500 - 5000: these are the prices Market Makers could really take advantage of during panic sell, accumulating over a longer period, holding prices up long enough to establish faith in the market again that it has stabilised at a ""bottom"".  

Positions to take: 1) short on low leverage. 2) stack with higher leverage or smaller stacks pushing liquidation up to 7k or 7,2 to be quite safe.

					bearish signals:  
200ema on 4hr has showed up as resistance. though on the 1 hour price has broken above it. 
bullish signals: 
CMF shows there's still a lot of buying pressure keeping the price up putting pressure on short positions in this range to pull out causing a small spike into heavier bear territory. Possibility to see 6800 again before going down. 
If price is able to stabilise on the blue rectangle with current orders taking profits or closing, another bull rally will be likely. 

Conclusion: I would not look to open a short position if I saw a 4hr candle open and close above the 4h 200ema. But with major resistance at 7k, where I believe there's a lot of supply waiting to get out of btc, I would not FOMO into a long here either. Only a break above the low 7k zone would confirm for a bull rally to 8k, 9k. 
A drop at this point down to 6300 - 6180 support zone will build pressure in the channel, as the support line forms a triangle with the channel resistance. This support is weak and without a strong market incentive will collapse against the more dominant downward trend.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays 0.00%  push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC 0.54%  hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin 0.54%  will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.

In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin 0.52%  during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Looking at the choppy legs up, the  RSI  shows it is overbought, retracement to around fib level of 0.3-0.5 or 6.3k is expected. although a final leg towards higher 6.7k might happen before the dump.  

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before. 

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.52%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr 2.16% RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr 2.16% rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions. 

We see an ascending  wedge . Last two proved  bearish .  
Possible  H&S  forming. Doesn't matter if legitimate, it is obvious enough for people to see it's possibility.  

Bullish  signals: 
price broke major channel resistance. Zoom out on the chart to see. 
on the daily  volume  is slightly increasing. 

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.  

Assumptions: 
This ""spring"" regarding Wyckoff accumulation  TR              happened on such a small time frame I don't think Market Makers gathered enough information to push forth another bull run. Market reputation still hurting too much and there is still plenty of logarithmic room for prices to drop further. This is a very impatient market, for mass adoption a 1 week long spring is not long enough. 4500 - 5000: these are the prices Market Makers could really take advantage of during panic sell, accumulating over a longer period, holding prices up long enough to establish faith in the market again that it has stabilised at a ""bottom"".  

Positions to take: 1) short on low leverage. 2) stack with higher leverage or smaller stacks pushing liquidation up to 7k or 7,2 to be quite safe.

					bearish signals:  
200ema on 4hr has showed up as resistance. though on the 1 hour price has broken above it. 
bullish signals: 
CMF shows there's still a lot of buying pressure keeping the price up putting pressure on short positions in this range to pull out causing a small spike into heavier bear territory. Possibility to see 6800 again before going down. 
If price is able to stabilise on the blue rectangle with current orders taking profits or closing, another bull rally will be likely. 

Conclusion: I would not look to open a short position if I saw a 4hr candle open and close above the 4h 200ema. But with major resistance at 7k, where I believe there's a lot of supply waiting to get out of btc, I would not FOMO into a long here either. Only a break above the low 7k zone would confirm for a bull rally to 8k, 9k. 
A drop at this point down to 6300 - 6180 support zone will build pressure in the channel, as the support line forms a triangle with the channel resistance. This support is weak and without a strong market incentive will collapse against the more dominant downward trend.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays 0.00%  push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC 0.52%  hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin 0.52%  will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.  

I am going to do a more detailed  Bitcoin 0.52%  analysis this week, stay tuned!!

Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Looking at the choppy legs up, the  RSI  shows it is overbought, retracement to around fib level of 0.3-0.5 or 6.3k is expected. although a final leg towards higher 6.7k might happen before the dump.  

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before. 

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.47%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr 2.16% RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr 2.16% rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions. 

We see an ascending  wedge . Last two proved  bearish .  
Possible  H&S  forming. Doesn't matter if legitimate, it is obvious enough for people to see it's possibility.  

Bullish  signals: 
price broke major channel resistance. Zoom out on the chart to see. 
on the daily  volume  is slightly increasing. 

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.  

Assumptions: 
This ""spring"" regarding Wyckoff accumulation  TR              happened on such a small time frame I don't think Market Makers gathered enough information to push forth another bull run. Market reputation still hurting too much and there is still plenty of logarithmic room for prices to drop further. This is a very impatient market, for mass adoption a 1 week long spring is not long enough. 4500 - 5000: these are the prices Market Makers could really take advantage of during panic sell, accumulating over a longer period, holding prices up long enough to establish faith in the market again that it has stabilised at a ""bottom"".  

Positions to take: 1) short on low leverage. 2) stack with higher leverage or smaller stacks pushing liquidation up to 7k or 7,2 to be quite safe.

					bearish signals:  
200ema on 4hr has showed up as resistance. though on the 1 hour price has broken above it. 
bullish signals: 
CMF shows there's still a lot of buying pressure keeping the price up putting pressure on short positions in this range to pull out causing a small spike into heavier bear territory. Possibility to see 6800 again before going down. 
If price is able to stabilise on the blue rectangle with current orders taking profits or closing, another bull rally will be likely. 

Conclusion: I would not look to open a short position if I saw a 4hr candle open and close above the 4h 200ema. But with major resistance at 7k, where I believe there's a lot of supply waiting to get out of btc, I would not FOMO into a long here either. Only a break above the low 7k zone would confirm for a bull rally to 8k, 9k. 
A drop at this point down to 6300 - 6180 support zone will build pressure in the channel, as the support line forms a triangle with the channel resistance. This support is weak and without a strong market incentive will collapse against the more dominant downward trend.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays 0.00%  push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC 0.47%  hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin 0.47%  will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.

Currently,  bitcoin 0.47%  is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin 0.47%  during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively).

Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Looking at the choppy legs up, the  RSI  shows it is overbought, retracement to around fib level of 0.3-0.5 or 6.3k is expected. although a final leg towards higher 6.7k might happen before the dump.  

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before. 

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.47%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr             RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr             rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions. 

We see an ascending  wedge . Last two proved  bearish .  
Possible  H&S  forming. Doesn't matter if legitimate, it is obvious enough for people to see it's possibility.  

Bullish  signals: 
price broke major channel resistance. Zoom out on the chart to see. 
on the daily  volume  is slightly increasing. 

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.  

Assumptions: 
This ""spring"" regarding Wyckoff accumulation  TR 0.64%  happened on such a small time frame I don't think Market Makers gathered enough information to push forth another bull run. Market reputation still hurting too much and there is still plenty of logarithmic room for prices to drop further. This is a very impatient market, for mass adoption a 1 week long spring is not long enough. 4500 - 5000: these are the prices Market Makers could really take advantage of during panic sell, accumulating over a longer period, holding prices up long enough to establish faith in the market again that it has stabilised at a ""bottom"".  

Positions to take: 1) short on low leverage. 2) stack with higher leverage or smaller stacks pushing liquidation up to 7k or 7,2 to be quite safe.

					bearish signals:  
200ema on 4hr has showed up as resistance. though on the 1 hour price has broken above it. 
bullish signals: 
CMF shows there's still a lot of buying pressure keeping the price up putting pressure on short positions in this range to pull out causing a small spike into heavier bear territory. Possibility to see 6800 again before going down. 
If price is able to stabilise on the blue rectangle with current orders taking profits or closing, another bull rally will be likely. 

Conclusion: I would not look to open a short position if I saw a 4hr candle open and close above the 4h 200ema. But with major resistance at 7k, where I believe there's a lot of supply waiting to get out of btc, I would not FOMO into a long here either. Only a break above the low 7k zone would confirm for a bull rally to 8k, 9k. 
A drop at this point down to 6300 - 6180 support zone will build pressure in the channel, as the support line forms a triangle with the channel resistance. This support is weak and without a strong market incentive will collapse against the more dominant downward trend.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays 0.00%  push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC 0.47%  hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin 0.47%  will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.

Currently,  bitcoin              is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin              during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.

Looking at the choppy legs up, the  RSI  shows it is overbought, retracement to around fib level of 0.3-0.5 or 6.3k is expected. although a final leg towards higher 6.7k might happen before the dump.  

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before. 

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.46%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr             RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr             rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions. 

We see an ascending  wedge . Last two proved  bearish .  
Possible  H&S  forming. Doesn't matter if legitimate, it is obvious enough for people to see it's possibility.  

Bullish  signals: 
price broke major channel resistance. Zoom out on the chart to see. 
on the daily  volume  is slightly increasing. 

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.  

Assumptions: 
This ""spring"" regarding Wyckoff accumulation  TR              happened on such a small time frame I don't think Market Makers gathered enough information to push forth another bull run. Market reputation still hurting too much and there is still plenty of logarithmic room for prices to drop further. This is a very impatient market, for mass adoption a 1 week long spring is not long enough. 4500 - 5000: these are the prices Market Makers could really take advantage of during panic sell, accumulating over a longer period, holding prices up long enough to establish faith in the market again that it has stabilised at a ""bottom"".  

Positions to take: 1) short on low leverage. 2) stack with higher leverage or smaller stacks pushing liquidation up to 7k or 7,2 to be quite safe.

					bearish signals:  
200ema on 4hr has showed up as resistance. though on the 1 hour price has broken above it. 
bullish signals: 
CMF shows there's still a lot of buying pressure keeping the price up putting pressure on short positions in this range to pull out causing a small spike into heavier bear territory. Possibility to see 6800 again before going down. 
If price is able to stabilise on the blue rectangle with current orders taking profits or closing, another bull rally will be likely. 

Conclusion: I would not look to open a short position if I saw a 4hr candle open and close above the 4h 200ema. But with major resistance at 7k, where I believe there's a lot of supply waiting to get out of btc, I would not FOMO into a long here either. Only a break above the low 7k zone would confirm for a bull rally to 8k, 9k. 
A drop at this point down to 6300 - 6180 support zone will build pressure in the channel, as the support line forms a triangle with the channel resistance. This support is weak and without a strong market incentive will collapse against the more dominant downward trend.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays 0.00%  push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC 0.46%  hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin 0.46%  will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.  

I am going to do a more detailed  Bitcoin 0.46%  analysis this week, stay tuned!!

Currently,  bitcoin 0.46%  is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin 0.46%  during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before. 

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.46%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr 2.16% RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr 2.16% rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions. 

We see an ascending  wedge . Last two proved  bearish .  
Possible  H&S  forming. Doesn't matter if legitimate, it is obvious enough for people to see it's possibility.  

Bullish  signals: 
price broke major channel resistance. Zoom out on the chart to see. 
on the daily  volume  is slightly increasing. 

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.  

Assumptions: 
This ""spring"" regarding Wyckoff accumulation  TR 0.64%  happened on such a small time frame I don't think Market Makers gathered enough information to push forth another bull run. Market reputation still hurting too much and there is still plenty of logarithmic room for prices to drop further. This is a very impatient market, for mass adoption a 1 week long spring is not long enough. 4500 - 5000: these are the prices Market Makers could really take advantage of during panic sell, accumulating over a longer period, holding prices up long enough to establish faith in the market again that it has stabilised at a ""bottom"".  

Positions to take: 1) short on low leverage. 2) stack with higher leverage or smaller stacks pushing liquidation up to 7k or 7,2 to be quite safe.

					bearish signals:  
200ema on 4hr has showed up as resistance. though on the 1 hour price has broken above it. 
bullish signals: 
CMF shows there's still a lot of buying pressure keeping the price up putting pressure on short positions in this range to pull out causing a small spike into heavier bear territory. Possibility to see 6800 again before going down. 
If price is able to stabilise on the blue rectangle with current orders taking profits or closing, another bull rally will be likely. 

Conclusion: I would not look to open a short position if I saw a 4hr candle open and close above the 4h 200ema. But with major resistance at 7k, where I believe there's a lot of supply waiting to get out of btc, I would not FOMO into a long here either. Only a break above the low 7k zone would confirm for a bull rally to 8k, 9k. 
A drop at this point down to 6300 - 6180 support zone will build pressure in the channel, as the support line forms a triangle with the channel resistance. This support is weak and without a strong market incentive will collapse against the more dominant downward trend.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays 0.00%  push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC 0.46%  hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin 0.46%  will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.  

I am going to do a more detailed  Bitcoin 0.46%  analysis this week, stay tuned!!

Currently,  bitcoin 0.46%  is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin 0.46%  during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.46%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr             RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr             rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions. 

We see an ascending  wedge . Last two proved  bearish .  
Possible  H&S  forming. Doesn't matter if legitimate, it is obvious enough for people to see it's possibility.  

Bullish  signals: 
price broke major channel resistance. Zoom out on the chart to see. 
on the daily  volume  is slightly increasing. 

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.  

Assumptions: 
This ""spring"" regarding Wyckoff accumulation  TR              happened on such a small time frame I don't think Market Makers gathered enough information to push forth another bull run. Market reputation still hurting too much and there is still plenty of logarithmic room for prices to drop further. This is a very impatient market, for mass adoption a 1 week long spring is not long enough. 4500 - 5000: these are the prices Market Makers could really take advantage of during panic sell, accumulating over a longer period, holding prices up long enough to establish faith in the market again that it has stabilised at a ""bottom"".  

Positions to take: 1) short on low leverage. 2) stack with higher leverage or smaller stacks pushing liquidation up to 7k or 7,2 to be quite safe.

					bearish signals:  
200ema on 4hr has showed up as resistance. though on the 1 hour price has broken above it. 
bullish signals: 
CMF shows there's still a lot of buying pressure keeping the price up putting pressure on short positions in this range to pull out causing a small spike into heavier bear territory. Possibility to see 6800 again before going down. 
If price is able to stabilise on the blue rectangle with current orders taking profits or closing, another bull rally will be likely. 

Conclusion: I would not look to open a short position if I saw a 4hr candle open and close above the 4h 200ema. But with major resistance at 7k, where I believe there's a lot of supply waiting to get out of btc, I would not FOMO into a long here either. Only a break above the low 7k zone would confirm for a bull rally to 8k, 9k. 
A drop at this point down to 6300 - 6180 support zone will build pressure in the channel, as the support line forms a triangle with the channel resistance. This support is weak and without a strong market incentive will collapse against the more dominant downward trend.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays              push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC              hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin              will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.

Currently,  bitcoin              is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin              during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.43%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr             RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr             rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions. 

We see an ascending  wedge . Last two proved  bearish .  
Possible  H&S  forming. Doesn't matter if legitimate, it is obvious enough for people to see it's possibility.  

Bullish  signals: 
price broke major channel resistance. Zoom out on the chart to see. 
on the daily  volume  is slightly increasing. 

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.  

Assumptions: 
This ""spring"" regarding Wyckoff accumulation  TR 0.64%  happened on such a small time frame I don't think Market Makers gathered enough information to push forth another bull run. Market reputation still hurting too much and there is still plenty of logarithmic room for prices to drop further. This is a very impatient market, for mass adoption a 1 week long spring is not long enough. 4500 - 5000: these are the prices Market Makers could really take advantage of during panic sell, accumulating over a longer period, holding prices up long enough to establish faith in the market again that it has stabilised at a ""bottom"".  

Positions to take: 1) short on low leverage. 2) stack with higher leverage or smaller stacks pushing liquidation up to 7k or 7,2 to be quite safe.

					bearish signals:  
200ema on 4hr has showed up as resistance. though on the 1 hour price has broken above it. 
bullish signals: 
CMF shows there's still a lot of buying pressure keeping the price up putting pressure on short positions in this range to pull out causing a small spike into heavier bear territory. Possibility to see 6800 again before going down. 
If price is able to stabilise on the blue rectangle with current orders taking profits or closing, another bull rally will be likely. 

Conclusion: I would not look to open a short position if I saw a 4hr candle open and close above the 4h 200ema. But with major resistance at 7k, where I believe there's a lot of supply waiting to get out of btc, I would not FOMO into a long here either. Only a break above the low 7k zone would confirm for a bull rally to 8k, 9k. 
A drop at this point down to 6300 - 6180 support zone will build pressure in the channel, as the support line forms a triangle with the channel resistance. This support is weak and without a strong market incentive will collapse against the more dominant downward trend.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays 0.00%  push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC 0.36%  hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin 0.36%  will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.  

I am going to do a more detailed  Bitcoin 0.36%  analysis this week, stay tuned!!

Currently,  bitcoin 0.36%  is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin 0.36%  during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Looking at the choppy legs up, the  RSI  shows it is overbought, retracement to around fib level of 0.3-0.5 or 6.3k is expected. although a final leg towards higher 6.7k might happen before the dump.  

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before.

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin              retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr             RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr             rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions. 

We see an ascending  wedge . Last two proved  bearish .  
Possible  H&S  forming. Doesn't matter if legitimate, it is obvious enough for people to see it's possibility.  

Bullish  signals: 
price broke major channel resistance. Zoom out on the chart to see. 
on the daily  volume  is slightly increasing. 

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.  

Assumptions: 
This ""spring"" regarding Wyckoff accumulation  TR              happened on such a small time frame I don't think Market Makers gathered enough information to push forth another bull run. Market reputation still hurting too much and there is still plenty of logarithmic room for prices to drop further. This is a very impatient market, for mass adoption a 1 week long spring is not long enough. 4500 - 5000: these are the prices Market Makers could really take advantage of during panic sell, accumulating over a longer period, holding prices up long enough to establish faith in the market again that it has stabilised at a ""bottom"".  

Positions to take: 1) short on low leverage. 2) stack with higher leverage or smaller stacks pushing liquidation up to 7k or 7,2 to be quite safe.

					bearish signals:  
200ema on 4hr has showed up as resistance. though on the 1 hour price has broken above it. 
bullish signals: 
CMF shows there's still a lot of buying pressure keeping the price up putting pressure on short positions in this range to pull out causing a small spike into heavier bear territory. Possibility to see 6800 again before going down. 
If price is able to stabilise on the blue rectangle with current orders taking profits or closing, another bull rally will be likely. 

Conclusion: I would not look to open a short position if I saw a 4hr candle open and close above the 4h 200ema. But with major resistance at 7k, where I believe there's a lot of supply waiting to get out of btc, I would not FOMO into a long here either. Only a break above the low 7k zone would confirm for a bull rally to 8k, 9k. 
A drop at this point down to 6300 - 6180 support zone will build pressure in the channel, as the support line forms a triangle with the channel resistance. This support is weak and without a strong market incentive will collapse against the more dominant downward trend.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays              push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC              hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin              will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.

Currently,  bitcoin 0.36%  is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin 0.36%  during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Looking at the choppy legs up, the  RSI  shows it is overbought, retracement to around fib level of 0.3-0.5 or 6.3k is expected. although a final leg towards higher 6.7k might happen before the dump.  

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before.

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.36%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr 2.16% RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr 2.16% rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions. 

We see an ascending  wedge . Last two proved  bearish .  
Possible  H&S  forming. Doesn't matter if legitimate, it is obvious enough for people to see it's possibility.  

Bullish  signals: 
price broke major channel resistance. Zoom out on the chart to see. 
on the daily  volume  is slightly increasing. 

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.  

Assumptions: 
This ""spring"" regarding Wyckoff accumulation  TR 0.64%  happened on such a small time frame I don't think Market Makers gathered enough information to push forth another bull run. Market reputation still hurting too much and there is still plenty of logarithmic room for prices to drop further. This is a very impatient market, for mass adoption a 1 week long spring is not long enough. 4500 - 5000: these are the prices Market Makers could really take advantage of during panic sell, accumulating over a longer period, holding prices up long enough to establish faith in the market again that it has stabilised at a ""bottom"".  

Positions to take: 1) short on low leverage. 2) stack with higher leverage or smaller stacks pushing liquidation up to 7k or 7,2 to be quite safe.

					bearish signals:  
200ema on 4hr has showed up as resistance. though on the 1 hour price has broken above it. 
bullish signals: 
CMF shows there's still a lot of buying pressure keeping the price up putting pressure on short positions in this range to pull out causing a small spike into heavier bear territory. Possibility to see 6800 again before going down. 
If price is able to stabilise on the blue rectangle with current orders taking profits or closing, another bull rally will be likely. 

Conclusion: I would not look to open a short position if I saw a 4hr candle open and close above the 4h 200ema. But with major resistance at 7k, where I believe there's a lot of supply waiting to get out of btc, I would not FOMO into a long here either. Only a break above the low 7k zone would confirm for a bull rally to 8k, 9k. 
A drop at this point down to 6300 - 6180 support zone will build pressure in the channel, as the support line forms a triangle with the channel resistance. This support is weak and without a strong market incentive will collapse against the more dominant downward trend.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays              push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC              hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin              will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.

Currently,  bitcoin 0.36%  is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin 0.36%  during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Looking at the choppy legs up, the  RSI  shows it is overbought, retracement to around fib level of 0.3-0.5 or 6.3k is expected. although a final leg towards higher 6.7k might happen before the dump.  

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before.

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.37%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr             RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr             rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions. 

We see an ascending  wedge . Last two proved  bearish .  
Possible  H&S  forming. Doesn't matter if legitimate, it is obvious enough for people to see it's possibility.  

Bullish  signals: 
price broke major channel resistance. Zoom out on the chart to see. 
on the daily  volume  is slightly increasing. 

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.  

Assumptions: 
This ""spring"" regarding Wyckoff accumulation  TR              happened on such a small time frame I don't think Market Makers gathered enough information to push forth another bull run. Market reputation still hurting too much and there is still plenty of logarithmic room for prices to drop further. This is a very impatient market, for mass adoption a 1 week long spring is not long enough. 4500 - 5000: these are the prices Market Makers could really take advantage of during panic sell, accumulating over a longer period, holding prices up long enough to establish faith in the market again that it has stabilised at a ""bottom"".  

Positions to take: 1) short on low leverage. 2) stack with higher leverage or smaller stacks pushing liquidation up to 7k or 7,2 to be quite safe.

					bearish signals:  
200ema on 4hr has showed up as resistance. though on the 1 hour price has broken above it. 
bullish signals: 
CMF shows there's still a lot of buying pressure keeping the price up putting pressure on short positions in this range to pull out causing a small spike into heavier bear territory. Possibility to see 6800 again before going down. 
If price is able to stabilise on the blue rectangle with current orders taking profits or closing, another bull rally will be likely. 

Conclusion: I would not look to open a short position if I saw a 4hr candle open and close above the 4h 200ema. But with major resistance at 7k, where I believe there's a lot of supply waiting to get out of btc, I would not FOMO into a long here either. Only a break above the low 7k zone would confirm for a bull rally to 8k, 9k. 
A drop at this point down to 6300 - 6180 support zone will build pressure in the channel, as the support line forms a triangle with the channel resistance. This support is weak and without a strong market incentive will collapse against the more dominant downward trend.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays 0.00%  push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC 0.43%  hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin 0.43%  will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.  

I am going to do a more detailed  Bitcoin 0.43%  analysis this week, stay tuned!!

Currently,  bitcoin 0.43%  is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin 0.43%  during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before. 

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.44%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr 2.16% RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr 2.16% rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions. 

We see an ascending  wedge . Last two proved  bearish .  
Possible  H&S  forming. Doesn't matter if legitimate, it is obvious enough for people to see it's possibility.  

Bullish  signals: 
price broke major channel resistance. Zoom out on the chart to see. 
on the daily  volume  is slightly increasing. 

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.  

Assumptions: 
This ""spring"" regarding Wyckoff accumulation  TR 0.64%  happened on such a small time frame I don't think Market Makers gathered enough information to push forth another bull run. Market reputation still hurting too much and there is still plenty of logarithmic room for prices to drop further. This is a very impatient market, for mass adoption a 1 week long spring is not long enough. 4500 - 5000: these are the prices Market Makers could really take advantage of during panic sell, accumulating over a longer period, holding prices up long enough to establish faith in the market again that it has stabilised at a ""bottom"".  

Positions to take: 1) short on low leverage. 2) stack with higher leverage or smaller stacks pushing liquidation up to 7k or 7,2 to be quite safe.

					bearish signals:  
200ema on 4hr has showed up as resistance. though on the 1 hour price has broken above it. 
bullish signals: 
CMF shows there's still a lot of buying pressure keeping the price up putting pressure on short positions in this range to pull out causing a small spike into heavier bear territory. Possibility to see 6800 again before going down. 
If price is able to stabilise on the blue rectangle with current orders taking profits or closing, another bull rally will be likely. 

Conclusion: I would not look to open a short position if I saw a 4hr candle open and close above the 4h 200ema. But with major resistance at 7k, where I believe there's a lot of supply waiting to get out of btc, I would not FOMO into a long here either. Only a break above the low 7k zone would confirm for a bull rally to 8k, 9k. 
A drop at this point down to 6300 - 6180 support zone will build pressure in the channel, as the support line forms a triangle with the channel resistance. This support is weak and without a strong market incentive will collapse against the more dominant downward trend.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays 0.00%  push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC 0.51%  hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin 0.51%  will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.  

I am going to do a more detailed  Bitcoin 0.51%  analysis this week, stay tuned!!

Currently,  bitcoin 0.53%  is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin 0.53%  during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Looking at the choppy legs up, the  RSI  shows it is overbought, retracement to around fib level of 0.3-0.5 or 6.3k is expected. although a final leg towards higher 6.7k might happen before the dump.  

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before. 

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.53%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr 2.16% RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr 2.16% rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions. 

We see an ascending  wedge . Last two proved  bearish .  
Possible  H&S  forming. Doesn't matter if legitimate, it is obvious enough for people to see it's possibility.  

Bullish  signals: 
price broke major channel resistance. Zoom out on the chart to see. 
on the daily  volume  is slightly increasing. 

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.  

Assumptions: 
This ""spring"" regarding Wyckoff accumulation  TR 0.64%  happened on such a small time frame I don't think Market Makers gathered enough information to push forth another bull run. Market reputation still hurting too much and there is still plenty of logarithmic room for prices to drop further. This is a very impatient market, for mass adoption a 1 week long spring is not long enough. 4500 - 5000: these are the prices Market Makers could really take advantage of during panic sell, accumulating over a longer period, holding prices up long enough to establish faith in the market again that it has stabilised at a ""bottom"".  

Positions to take: 1) short on low leverage. 2) stack with higher leverage or smaller stacks pushing liquidation up to 7k or 7,2 to be quite safe.

					bearish signals:  
200ema on 4hr has showed up as resistance. though on the 1 hour price has broken above it. 
bullish signals: 
CMF shows there's still a lot of buying pressure keeping the price up putting pressure on short positions in this range to pull out causing a small spike into heavier bear territory. Possibility to see 6800 again before going down. 
If price is able to stabilise on the blue rectangle with current orders taking profits or closing, another bull rally will be likely. 

Conclusion: I would not look to open a short position if I saw a 4hr candle open and close above the 4h 200ema. But with major resistance at 7k, where I believe there's a lot of supply waiting to get out of btc, I would not FOMO into a long here either. Only a break above the low 7k zone would confirm for a bull rally to 8k, 9k. 
A drop at this point down to 6300 - 6180 support zone will build pressure in the channel, as the support line forms a triangle with the channel resistance. This support is weak and without a strong market incentive will collapse against the more dominant downward trend.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays 0.00%  push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC 0.53%  hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin 0.53%  will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.  

I am going to do a more detailed  Bitcoin 0.53%  analysis this week, stay tuned!!

Currently,  bitcoin 0.52%  is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin 0.52%  during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Looking at the choppy legs up, the  RSI  shows it is overbought, retracement to around fib level of 0.3-0.5 or 6.3k is expected. although a final leg towards higher 6.7k might happen before the dump.  

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before. 

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.48%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr 2.16% RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr 2.16% rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions. 

We see an ascending  wedge . Last two proved  bearish .  
Possible  H&S  forming. Doesn't matter if legitimate, it is obvious enough for people to see it's possibility.  

Bullish  signals: 
price broke major channel resistance. Zoom out on the chart to see. 
on the daily  volume  is slightly increasing. 

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.  

Assumptions: 
This ""spring"" regarding Wyckoff accumulation  TR              happened on such a small time frame I don't think Market Makers gathered enough information to push forth another bull run. Market reputation still hurting too much and there is still plenty of logarithmic room for prices to drop further. This is a very impatient market, for mass adoption a 1 week long spring is not long enough. 4500 - 5000: these are the prices Market Makers could really take advantage of during panic sell, accumulating over a longer period, holding prices up long enough to establish faith in the market again that it has stabilised at a ""bottom"".  

Positions to take: 1) short on low leverage. 2) stack with higher leverage or smaller stacks pushing liquidation up to 7k or 7,2 to be quite safe.

					bearish signals:  
200ema on 4hr has showed up as resistance. though on the 1 hour price has broken above it. 
bullish signals: 
CMF shows there's still a lot of buying pressure keeping the price up putting pressure on short positions in this range to pull out causing a small spike into heavier bear territory. Possibility to see 6800 again before going down. 
If price is able to stabilise on the blue rectangle with current orders taking profits or closing, another bull rally will be likely. 

Conclusion: I would not look to open a short position if I saw a 4hr candle open and close above the 4h 200ema. But with major resistance at 7k, where I believe there's a lot of supply waiting to get out of btc, I would not FOMO into a long here either. Only a break above the low 7k zone would confirm for a bull rally to 8k, 9k. 
A drop at this point down to 6300 - 6180 support zone will build pressure in the channel, as the support line forms a triangle with the channel resistance. This support is weak and without a strong market incentive will collapse against the more dominant downward trend.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.

So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October.

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays 0.00%  push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC 0.48%  hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin 0.48%  will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.  

I am going to do a more detailed  Bitcoin 0.48%  analysis this week, stay tuned!!

Currently,  bitcoin 0.48%  is in a downtrend, and I am going to support my idea using the weekly  RSI  because I believe that divergence is a strong indicator of a changing trend. In this graph, I have noted the divergences that have occurred in  bitcoin 0.48%  during the weekly time frame. However, as you can see there I have made the  bearish  divergence in red and the  bullish divergence  in yellow, and they both mark essentially the point of the long term reversal that have occurred. It is in my strong opinion, that a weekly  bullish divergence  would occur in the weekly  RSI  sometime in the future to mark an honest market reversal. It would make sense, because the only way to negate or cancel out a divergence in a specific time frame is another divergence in the same time frame. IT is also important to note that it is not essential that it does form a divergence, but it would be a strong indicator of a trend change. For instance, during this last movement up the (10k move in April) there was a  bearish  divergence that occurred on the daily candle sticks, and during its reversal that was also a  bullish divergence  on the daily candle sticks. However, I do believe there was no divergences on the last two movements downwards, the one in February, and March (the v bottom and the symmetrical triangle bottom, respectively). Given the time frame and the magnitude of the  bullish divergence  in yellow, it makes sense that we have entered a long term bull market because, there has been a strong set up for a bull rally for weeks prior to the actual start of the bull rally. 

However, it is possible that there is not a  bullish divergence  to occur on the weekly time frame, I do think that it is a strong possibility that it will.  

I like to image  RSI  divergences as a hidden indicator that a faction whether it be  bearish  or  bullish , is losing control of the current market trend and there is a high possibility of a shifting market trend.  

So to note, I do not know the price at which we will bottom on the longer term, but we have bottomed now. Be cautious and take advantages of the different movements despite it being more  bearish , trade to your personal style. Also it is possible that this current move is a solid bottom, it just depends on what is to come, but in my opinion, expect to see other downward movements, however, I do not know if they will be at this same bottom 5750 or lower or higher.  

This is the  bearish  divergence that occurred during the peak in 2014. (Also note that I did not use the chart for  bitstamp  as the main chart because there is no  bullish divergence  that occurs on it in 2015 or 2016, so it the divergence will also depend on the exchange you are a part of).

Looking at the choppy legs up, the  RSI  shows it is overbought, retracement to around fib level of 0.3-0.5 or 6.3k is expected. although a final leg towards higher 6.7k might happen before the dump.  

As for fib targets if we break 6.7k (1.6) resistance, there is 7.4k at 2.6 level or 7.8k at 3.6(lower possibility). 

Tenkan is acting as support at 4H TF until it doesnt. kijun sitting at 6.3k or 0.3-0.5 retracement fib level as mentioned before. 

Fib Guppy is tightening with 5 levels, a few more hours and it would be 7--which would indicate  volatility  depending on the candle close direction (either above or below guppy). 

altcoins (highcaps) would be starting (if not yet) bleeding until  Bitcoin 0.48%  retests 6.3k. No fomo needed as there will be a chance to re-enter for altcoiners soon.

2 hours ago




 Bearish  signals: 
Divergence on the 1 hour  Macd  and  RSI , 4  hr 2.16% RSI  shows divergence better. 4  hr 2.16% rsi  crossed signal line. 
Daily:  RSI  divergence. 
Volume  drops off at rallies, this is a weak sign of strength. 
Bulls must gather more momentum, I'm not sure where this'll come from given major resistance up ahead.  
Long positions are top heavy, there's a lot of room for taking profits vs short positions. 

We see an ascending  wedge . Last two proved  bearish .  
Possible  H&S  forming. Doesn't matter if legitimate, it is obvious enough for people to see it's possibility.  

Bullish  signals: 
price broke major channel resistance. Zoom out on the chart to see. 
on the daily  volume  is slightly increasing. 

Conclusion: 
price still can stretch another 200 - 400 points higher on a larger time frame 
rally is too weak to push 200 - 400 points higher before dropping on the hourly time frame. 
Breakout of channel was weak and caused minor divergence, likely to retest one of the outer channel lines as support before climbing higher, if climbing higher.  

Assumptions: 
This ""spring"" regarding Wyckoff accumulation  TR 0.64%  happened on such a small time frame I don't think Market Makers gathered enough information to push forth another bull run. Market reputation still hurting too much and there is still plenty of logarithmic room for prices to drop further. This is a very impatient market, for mass adoption a 1 week long spring is not long enough. 4500 - 5000: these are the prices Market Makers could really take advantage of during panic sell, accumulating over a longer period, holding prices up long enough to establish faith in the market again that it has stabilised at a ""bottom"".  

Positions to take: 1) short on low leverage. 2) stack with higher leverage or smaller stacks pushing liquidation up to 7k or 7,2 to be quite safe.

Comment:
					bearish signals:  
200ema on 4hr has showed up as resistance. though on the 1 hour price has broken above it. 
bullish signals: 
CMF shows there's still a lot of buying pressure keeping the price up putting pressure on short positions in this range to pull out causing a small spike into heavier bear territory. Possibility to see 6800 again before going down. 
If price is able to stabilise on the blue rectangle with current orders taking profits or closing, another bull rally will be likely. 

Conclusion: I would not look to open a short position if I saw a 4hr candle open and close above the 4h 200ema. But with major resistance at 7k, where I believe there's a lot of supply waiting to get out of btc, I would not FOMO into a long here either. Only a break above the low 7k zone would confirm for a bull rally to 8k, 9k. 
A drop at this point down to 6300 - 6180 support zone will build pressure in the channel, as the support line forms a triangle with the channel resistance. This support is weak and without a strong market incentive will collapse against the more dominant downward trend.

Sell below 6760.  
Stop loss at 7038.  
Take profit at 6294. 
Reason for the trading strategy (technically): 
BTCUSD 0.48%  reversed nicely off its resistance at 6760 (50%  Fibonacci retracement , 61.8%  Fibonacci extension , horizontal swing high resistance) where we expect price to fall to its support at 6294 (50%  Fibonacci retracement , horizontal overlap support).  
Stochastic  (89, 5, 3) reversed nicely off its resistance at 95% where a corresponding drop is expected. We have also identified a  bearish  divergence with price which contributes to our  bearish  bias.

Seems like there is an interesting point coming up. In the end we want to know if it goes up or down soon. 
Just thinking about it a while will get you clear about its movement. 
We had 1 correction now which took multiple years &  Bitcoin 0.48%  being way to new was the reason back then.

					There could be a dip to the 6350 area but as long as BTC remains above 6300 , its still on track for 7500.

Today saw two manipulated pumps. The one in the morning a lot of people fell for and we fomo'd up in price from 6500 to 6800 and it was rejected and dropped back down to 6500 within 12 hours. Then the second pump camp an hour after the dump and we saw less fomo this time. Fool me once kinda thing. The pump was about half the size and should last half the time or less until it dumps. Whoever is orchestrating these pumps really shouldn't do more than one pump in a 24 hour period. Trying it twice makes it less likely to succeed.  

Yeah I hate the manipulation just as much as you do, but this is what we have to accept if we truly want a decentralized currency. I think there should be happy medium though and some form of agreements and standards of practice needs to be observed between exchanges.

1530755935.0,nick203,Looking for reversal between now and November! NOT FINANCIAL ADV,"
So it looks like we are forming a  falling wedge , which is a  bullish  reversal pattern. The two outcomes i see most likely to happen, is  
1- the Eliot waves where we prematurely break the  wedge  and false breakout at the fib before a corrective wave then a full reversal at 5 wave. 
2- This one is actually probably more likely considering how well we are respecting the  wedge . Its the green line i drew in the  wedge . Basically we would trade within the  wedge  until a breakout at the end bringing us to mid October. 
 Remember this is not financial advice, enjoy everyone,

This is just a short idea that I have seen directly after  todays 0.00%  push.  
For me there is very strong resistance @6800 and that might hold, we might see  BTC 0.48%  hanging there for a few days and then going back down, regaining some deep  RSI  points and starting a new rally from there on.  
As it is right now, I don't believe that  Bitcoin 0.48%  will get REKT wishing 1 day. It will have its little bounces all along because now many people are buying dips again and there are man signs for a new bull run very soon.  
Nevertheless, I am saying very soon because we had a lot of very green days in the last time now and people are getting a little too excited and forget to take profits.  

I am going to do a more detailed  Bitcoin 0.48%  analysis this week, stay tuned!!

 Just thought I’d share. The more the market shows me it’s hand, the more  bullish  I think it’s hidden intentions are. Here’s what I’m currently seeing (for now). I’m going long soon after my RSI/CCI looks favorable to ride a wave 1 of a wave 5 up. Unless it truncated but I doubt it as it needs an extension to be a true impulsive structure otherwise count is invalidated. Tight stops on this one. I’m excited! Aloha.
