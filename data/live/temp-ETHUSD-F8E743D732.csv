1530202980.0,MAGICMARK,ETH ... squeezed into the BUY zone.,"
This is why I think ETH is a great buy opportunity. 

See all that green  ... months and months and months of support. 

See that red line ... see what it's doing to the price? 

What happens when we break that red line? 

I have orders stacked from $300 to $400 ... let's see if I'm wrong.  :) 

My biggest concern ... all my orders might not get filled.

Looking at 45min, 4h, and the 1D here...I see the down trend from 1400 continuing...the major  trend line  that I ran off the first 360, is being challenged here at the 420 area. If it breaks, there are historical levels (marked 350, 250-300, 200 (yes it is in play if this  trend line  does not hold)). We might pause or bounce off any of those levels. However, it is safe to say the longer term up trend  pitchfork  is done. My personal stance is we are looking for a new bottom, and the  volume  and level of  volatility  at 420 does not feel like blood in the streets. 

I'd be shorting on a break of 420 and covering no higher than 295. It is going down.

We have now seen 7 days in a row with lower highs for ETH.  
We are heading down to the lowest price on this drop which has already dropped to a lower low on the daily where LTC and  BTC -0.50%  have not.  
If we break to lower lows there are not many support levels left before the weekly support in the $300s.  
Very clear steady trend for the bears that will have to be broken with lots of momentum and  volume .  
Hard to anticipate any kind of significant move to break this momentum without news.  
Looking for clear breaks in the other names that are still in tightening ranges within the next 24 hours.

Crypto market seems to be in a downtrend in general. Here are few areas that would be interesting for me to buy if ETH keeps getting lower lows. 
I would like to see some good  volume  in those areas to actually buy.

THE TRIGGER:  
Ethereum -1.03%  has broken below the strong support at $450. It can now slide and move towards the next  support level  at ~$358. 

Trading Set Up: Not trading the correction back up but looking to take short positions once the price recovers a little.  

Obviously the 200EMA is showing an overall downtrend since the start of May so we look to only short to avoid trading against the market.  
The time frame that we are looking at is the 4h candle. (For medium term trades - 1-2 weeks position)  
Current Price is at $433 which is kind of in the middle of nowhere so we aim to get in the short position only when 
-The price traces back to the 50EMA (~$470) or the white  resistance area  at 490.  
The take profit level will be at the next  support area  @ around 390-400 or the bottom of the channel at 350, 
with the stop loss at around 525, just above the channel and at the 200EMA  

(Giving us a risk reward ratio of about 2.5 to 1)  

And of course, this trade is based on the  bearish  outlook of the crypto market and by taking this trade you need to know that you are betting that the market will not have a strong bounce back up within the next 2 weeks. 
(Just putting things into perspective)

So it has been a while since I have written an  Ethereum -1.03%  analysis.  Ethereum -1.03%  is trading between a  resistance zone  between 474 and 463 and a  support zone  between 421 and 411. Price movement was looking quite strong since bouncing off the horizontal support and we could see an up move to the side-wards resistance. Price has been weak with the last 2 2 hourly candles, but the selling is very minimum at this time and some buy orders could see price negate the last 2 bear candles quite easily. 

Price in the short term needs to make a decision whether it will go higher to the resistance, or lower to the support. If price goes to the support, this will create a triple bottom pattern and would almost inevitably cause some buying even if only for the short term. If price goes to the resistance, I believe price will probably find resistance at the horizontal  support/resistance  transition level and fall lower again. Whatever happens within this zone will ultimately decide if  Ethereum -1.03%  completes a long term  bearish flag  pattern which would far surpass the  support zone  outlined on my chart. If price hits the resistance, stays within the zone and picks up move momentum, over time the bulls might be able to negate the long term  bearish flag  in play with the long term trend and se  Ethereum -1.03%  up for some highs, even if only for a while.
