I find the patterns here on the last two rallys eerily similar.  Two bumps against the top of the flag, then only a partial retrace down to the red box before it reaches the top for a 3rd time.  Then a bounce off the bottom and back and forth before another rally up.  

What do you think of that?  My initial 3rd wave projection appears to be off, and if the 4th wave drops any further, it will invalidate my EW count... but even though the wicks of the 4th wave and 1st wave overlap just a smidge, I'm keeping my count where it for now.

 Bitcoin              hasn't looked this strong in two months. 

A sustained break above $7k would be near term  bullish  with potential to re-challenge $10k. 

If the downtrend continues, I suspect $5k would offer support, with price reaching this level by mid August, followed by a rally.

Some resistance on the .236 fib. If we can break above here then the path to 7000-7100 will be clear.   MACD  has plenty of room to run after a  bullish  cross.   RSI  trending upwards, but has some room for regression.   

If we see a continuation, then we have 8000 lying conveniently on the golden fibonacci of .618.

1530632819.0,icexch,Weekly review of 10 major cryptocurrencies 24.06.18 - 01.07.18,"
Last week major cryptocurrencies changed in price a little, achieving new local minimums during the week.  Bitcoin -0.50%  achieved its minimum of $ 5’780 and by the close of the week managed to rise above key level of $ 6’000. Its share in total capitalization increased to 42,5%. 
The number of billionaire-coins is still 18 and their total number (according to https://coinmarketcap.com) has increased to 1’597. 
The total capitalization of cryptocurrencies grew to $ 256 billion. 

Bitcoin -0.50%  increased by 3% from $ 6’150 to $ 6’350 last week, the minimum was $ 5’780. 






The market has sagged to key level of $ 6’000 and has been consolidating near it. There has not been close of day and week under $ 6’000 yet. However, it is almost inevitable without active purchases. 
Until $ 9’000 is overcome, long-term technical picture remains  bearish . 

Ethereum -1.49%  decreased by further 0,6% from $ 455 to $ 452, the minimum was $ 405. 






Ethtereum made a new minimum in the beginning of the week. However, it ended the week at the initial rate. Medium-term downward trend has continued. The zone of long-term support is from $ 360 and lower. The rise above $ 800 will be a signal of growth resumption. 

Ripple (XRPUSD) decreased by further 4% from $ 0,48 to $ 0,46 with the minimum of $ 0,415. 






The decline has continued. New local minimum was reached. Testing of April minimum of around $ 0,45 has been going on. Its break will open the way to $ 0,2 - $ 0,25. The further decline is more likely. 

BCHUSD -1.09%  decreased by further 1,2% from $ 747 to $ 738, the minimum was $ 646. 






The rate slowed down its incremental decline. However, there are no signs of turnaround and going up. The support is on $ 600 and $ 300. The resistance is $ 1’100 and then $ 1’800. The further decline is more likely. 

Litecoin fell by further 0,3% from $ 80,5 to $ 80,2, the minimum was $ 72. 






The key support near $ 100 is broken. There are no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 55 now. 

IOTA grew by 9% from $ 0,98 to $ 1,07 with the minimum of $ 0,89. 






IOTA did not manage to overcome the reached first decline target near $ 1 promptly. There was a rebound within very modest correction. The further gradual decrease to $ 0,33 is more likely. 

NEO is near $ 31 as it was with the minimum of $ 27. 






The support near $ 45 was broken. There are now no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 22. The further decline is more likely. 

Monero grew a bit by 7,5% from $ 121 to $ 130, the minimum was $ 114. 






The support above $ 150 was broken. And the decline continued. But the new minimum was not reached. Probably the appeared purchases rebalanced market. 
This week the consolidation on reached levels is more likely. 

DASH declined by further 1% from $ 238 to $ 236, the minimum was $ 210. 






The fall reached the support near $ 220. 
However, it is more likely to just stopped its decrease for a while. The further decline is more likely. 

NEM 0.37%  went up by 10% from $ 0,15 to $ 0,166 with the minimum of $ 0,14. 






Important support in $ 0,20 was broken. 
There are now no technical obstacles for decline to $ 0,1. The further decline is more likely.

As predicted in my last post  bitcoin              has not been successful breaking the  support level  which has been standing since last year. The price of  bitcoin              had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks. This would mainly depend on news as there has been a lot of negative news around cryptocurrencies. There is still a chance that the price may fall and test the  support level  once again but this could only be figured out over time. This is mainly due to the  RSI  being very close to oversold just as the price managed to get a little out of the  support zone .

As predicted in my last post  bitcoin -0.50%  has not been successful breaking the  support level  which has been standing since last year. The price of  bitcoin -0.50%  had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks. This would mainly depend on news as there has been a lot of negative news around cryptocurrencies. There is still a chance that the price may fall and test the  support level  once again but this could only be figured out over time. This is mainly due to the  RSI  being very close to oversold just as the price managed to get a little out of the  support zone .

I find the patterns here on the last two rallys eerily similar.  Two bumps against the top of the flag, then only a partial retrace down to the red box before it reaches the top for a 3rd time.  Then a bounce off the bottom and back and forth before another rally up.  

What do you think of that?  My initial 3rd wave projection appears to be off, and if the 4th wave drops any further, it will invalidate my EW count... but even though the wicks of the 4th wave and 1st wave overlap just a smidge, I'm keeping my count where it for now.

 Bitcoin              hasn't looked this strong in two months. 

A sustained break above $7k would be near term  bullish  with potential to re-challenge $10k. 

If the downtrend continues, I suspect $5k would offer support, with price reaching this level by mid August, followed by a rally. 

Bitcoin              tends to rally in the 2nd half of the year, beginning in August.

Some resistance on the .236 fib. If we can break above here then the path to 7000-7100 will be clear.   MACD  has plenty of room to run after a  bullish  cross.   RSI  trending upwards, but has some room for regression.   

If we see a continuation, then we have 8000 lying conveniently on the golden fibonacci of .618.

 Bitcoin              hasn't looked this strong in two months. 

A sustained break above $7k would be near term  bullish  with potential to re-challenge $10k. 

If the downtrend continues, I suspect $5k would offer support, with price reaching this level by mid August, followed by a rally.

Last week major cryptocurrencies changed in price a little, achieving new local minimums during the week.  Bitcoin -0.51%  achieved its minimum of $ 5’780 and by the close of the week managed to rise above key level of $ 6’000. Its share in total capitalization increased to 42,5%. 
The number of billionaire-coins is still 18 and their total number (according to https://coinmarketcap.com) has increased to 1’597. 
The total capitalization of cryptocurrencies grew to $ 256 billion. 

Bitcoin -0.51%  increased by 3% from $ 6’150 to $ 6’350 last week, the minimum was $ 5’780. 






The market has sagged to key level of $ 6’000 and has been consolidating near it. There has not been close of day and week under $ 6’000 yet. However, it is almost inevitable without active purchases. 
Until $ 9’000 is overcome, long-term technical picture remains  bearish . 

Ethereum -1.53%  decreased by further 0,6% from $ 455 to $ 452, the minimum was $ 405. 






Ethtereum made a new minimum in the beginning of the week. However, it ended the week at the initial rate. Medium-term downward trend has continued. The zone of long-term support is from $ 360 and lower. The rise above $ 800 will be a signal of growth resumption. 

Ripple (XRPUSD) decreased by further 4% from $ 0,48 to $ 0,46 with the minimum of $ 0,415. 






The decline has continued. New local minimum was reached. Testing of April minimum of around $ 0,45 has been going on. Its break will open the way to $ 0,2 - $ 0,25. The further decline is more likely. 

BCHUSD              decreased by further 1,2% from $ 747 to $ 738, the minimum was $ 646. 






The rate slowed down its incremental decline. However, there are no signs of turnaround and going up. The support is on $ 600 and $ 300. The resistance is $ 1’100 and then $ 1’800. The further decline is more likely. 

Litecoin fell by further 0,3% from $ 80,5 to $ 80,2, the minimum was $ 72. 






The key support near $ 100 is broken. There are no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 55 now. 

IOTA grew by 9% from $ 0,98 to $ 1,07 with the minimum of $ 0,89. 






IOTA did not manage to overcome the reached first decline target near $ 1 promptly. There was a rebound within very modest correction. The further gradual decrease to $ 0,33 is more likely. 

NEO is near $ 31 as it was with the minimum of $ 27. 






The support near $ 45 was broken. There are now no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 22. The further decline is more likely. 

Monero grew a bit by 7,5% from $ 121 to $ 130, the minimum was $ 114. 






The support above $ 150 was broken. And the decline continued. But the new minimum was not reached. Probably the appeared purchases rebalanced market. 
This week the consolidation on reached levels is more likely. 

DASH declined by further 1% from $ 238 to $ 236, the minimum was $ 210. 






The fall reached the support near $ 220. 
However, it is more likely to just stopped its decrease for a while. The further decline is more likely. 

NEM              went up by 10% from $ 0,15 to $ 0,166 with the minimum of $ 0,14. 






Important support in $ 0,20 was broken. 
There are now no technical obstacles for decline to $ 0,1. The further decline is more likely.

As predicted in my last post  bitcoin -0.51%  has not been successful breaking the  support level  which has been standing since last year. The price of  bitcoin -0.51%  had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks. This would mainly depend on news as there has been a lot of negative news around cryptocurrencies. There is still a chance that the price may fall and test the  support level  once again but this could only be figured out over time. This is mainly due to the  RSI  being very close to oversold just as the price managed to get a little out of the  support zone .

I find the patterns here on the last two rallys eerily similar.  Two bumps against the top of the flag, then only a partial retrace down to the red box before it reaches the top for a 3rd time.  Then a bounce off the bottom and back and forth before another rally up.  

What do you think of that?  My initial 3rd wave projection appears to be off, and if the 4th wave drops any further, it will invalidate my EW count... but even though the wicks of the 4th wave and 1st wave overlap just a smidge, I'm keeping my count where it for now.

As predicted in my last post  bitcoin              has not been successful breaking the  support level  which has been standing since last year. The price of  bitcoin              had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks. This would mainly depend on news as there has been a lot of negative news around cryptocurrencies. There is still a chance that the price may fall and test the  support level  once again but this could only be figured out over time. This is mainly due to the  RSI  being very close to oversold just as the price managed to get a little out of the  support zone .

I find the patterns here on the last two rallys eerily similar.  Two bumps against the top of the flag, then only a partial retrace down to the red box before it reaches the top for a 3rd time.  Then a bounce off the bottom and back and forth before another rally up.  

What do you think of that?  My initial 3rd wave projection appears to be off, and if the 4th wave drops any further, it will invalidate my EW count... but even though the wicks of the 4th wave and 1st wave overlap just a smidge, I'm keeping my count where it for now.

Some resistance on the .236 fib. If we can break above here then the path to 7000-7100 will be clear.   MACD  has plenty of room to run after a  bullish  cross.   RSI  trending upwards, but has some room for regression.   

If we see a continuation, then we have 8000 lying conveniently on the golden fibonacci of .618.

Last week major cryptocurrencies changed in price a little, achieving new local minimums during the week.  Bitcoin              achieved its minimum of $ 5’780 and by the close of the week managed to rise above key level of $ 6’000. Its share in total capitalization increased to 42,5%. 
The number of billionaire-coins is still 18 and their total number (according to https://coinmarketcap.com) has increased to 1’597. 
The total capitalization of cryptocurrencies grew to $ 256 billion. 

Bitcoin              increased by 3% from $ 6’150 to $ 6’350 last week, the minimum was $ 5’780. 






The market has sagged to key level of $ 6’000 and has been consolidating near it. There has not been close of day and week under $ 6’000 yet. However, it is almost inevitable without active purchases. 
Until $ 9’000 is overcome, long-term technical picture remains  bearish . 

Ethereum              decreased by further 0,6% from $ 455 to $ 452, the minimum was $ 405. 






Ethtereum made a new minimum in the beginning of the week. However, it ended the week at the initial rate. Medium-term downward trend has continued. The zone of long-term support is from $ 360 and lower. The rise above $ 800 will be a signal of growth resumption. 

Ripple (XRPUSD) decreased by further 4% from $ 0,48 to $ 0,46 with the minimum of $ 0,415. 






The decline has continued. New local minimum was reached. Testing of April minimum of around $ 0,45 has been going on. Its break will open the way to $ 0,2 - $ 0,25. The further decline is more likely. 

BCHUSD              decreased by further 1,2% from $ 747 to $ 738, the minimum was $ 646. 






The rate slowed down its incremental decline. However, there are no signs of turnaround and going up. The support is on $ 600 and $ 300. The resistance is $ 1’100 and then $ 1’800. The further decline is more likely. 

Litecoin fell by further 0,3% from $ 80,5 to $ 80,2, the minimum was $ 72. 






The key support near $ 100 is broken. There are no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 55 now. 

IOTA grew by 9% from $ 0,98 to $ 1,07 with the minimum of $ 0,89. 






IOTA did not manage to overcome the reached first decline target near $ 1 promptly. There was a rebound within very modest correction. The further gradual decrease to $ 0,33 is more likely. 

NEO is near $ 31 as it was with the minimum of $ 27. 






The support near $ 45 was broken. There are now no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 22. The further decline is more likely. 

Monero grew a bit by 7,5% from $ 121 to $ 130, the minimum was $ 114.

This week the consolidation on reached levels is more likely. 

DASH declined by further 1% from $ 238 to $ 236, the minimum was $ 210.

Some resistance on the .236 fib. If we can break above here then the path to 7000-7100 will be clear.   MACD  has plenty of room to run after a  bullish  cross.   RSI  trending upwards, but has some room for regression.   

If we see a continuation, then we have 8000 lying conveniently on the golden fibonacci of .618.

1530632819.0,icexch,Weekly review of 10 major cryptocurrencies 24.06.18 - 01.07.18,"
Last week major cryptocurrencies changed in price a little, achieving new local minimums during the week.  Bitcoin              achieved its minimum of $ 5’780 and by the close of the week managed to rise above key level of $ 6’000. Its share in total capitalization increased to 42,5%. 
The number of billionaire-coins is still 18 and their total number (according to https://coinmarketcap.com) has increased to 1’597. 
The total capitalization of cryptocurrencies grew to $ 256 billion. 

Bitcoin              increased by 3% from $ 6’150 to $ 6’350 last week, the minimum was $ 5’780. 






The market has sagged to key level of $ 6’000 and has been consolidating near it. There has not been close of day and week under $ 6’000 yet. However, it is almost inevitable without active purchases. 
Until $ 9’000 is overcome, long-term technical picture remains  bearish . 

Ethereum              decreased by further 0,6% from $ 455 to $ 452, the minimum was $ 405. 






Ethtereum made a new minimum in the beginning of the week. However, it ended the week at the initial rate. Medium-term downward trend has continued. The zone of long-term support is from $ 360 and lower. The rise above $ 800 will be a signal of growth resumption. 

Ripple (XRPUSD) decreased by further 4% from $ 0,48 to $ 0,46 with the minimum of $ 0,415. 






The decline has continued. New local minimum was reached. Testing of April minimum of around $ 0,45 has been going on. Its break will open the way to $ 0,2 - $ 0,25. The further decline is more likely. 

BCHUSD              decreased by further 1,2% from $ 747 to $ 738, the minimum was $ 646. 






The rate slowed down its incremental decline. However, there are no signs of turnaround and going up. The support is on $ 600 and $ 300. The resistance is $ 1’100 and then $ 1’800. The further decline is more likely. 

Litecoin fell by further 0,3% from $ 80,5 to $ 80,2, the minimum was $ 72. 






The key support near $ 100 is broken. There are no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 55 now. 

IOTA grew by 9% from $ 0,98 to $ 1,07 with the minimum of $ 0,89. 






IOTA did not manage to overcome the reached first decline target near $ 1 promptly. There was a rebound within very modest correction. The further gradual decrease to $ 0,33 is more likely. 

NEO is near $ 31 as it was with the minimum of $ 27. 






The support near $ 45 was broken. There are now no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 22. The further decline is more likely. 

Monero grew a bit by 7,5% from $ 121 to $ 130, the minimum was $ 114. 






The support above $ 150 was broken. And the decline continued. But the new minimum was not reached. Probably the appeared purchases rebalanced market. 
This week the consolidation on reached levels is more likely. 

DASH declined by further 1% from $ 238 to $ 236, the minimum was $ 210. 






The fall reached the support near $ 220. 
However, it is more likely to just stopped its decrease for a while. The further decline is more likely. 

NEM              went up by 10% from $ 0,15 to $ 0,166 with the minimum of $ 0,14. 






Important support in $ 0,20 was broken. 
There are now no technical obstacles for decline to $ 0,1. The further decline is more likely.

As predicted in my last post  bitcoin -0.60%  has not been successful breaking the  support level  which has been standing since last year. The price of  bitcoin -0.60%  had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks. This would mainly depend on news as there has been a lot of negative news around cryptocurrencies. There is still a chance that the price may fall and test the  support level  once again but this could only be figured out over time. This is mainly due to the  RSI  being very close to oversold just as the price managed to get a little out of the  support zone .

I find the patterns here on the last two rallys eerily similar.  Two bumps against the top of the flag, then only a partial retrace down to the red box before it reaches the top for a 3rd time.  Then a bounce off the bottom and back and forth before another rally up.  

What do you think of that?  My initial 3rd wave projection appears to be off, and if the 4th wave drops any further, it will invalidate my EW count... but even though the wicks of the 4th wave and 1st wave overlap just a smidge, I'm keeping my count where it for now.

As predicted in my last post  bitcoin              has not been successful breaking the  support level  which has been standing since last year. The price of  bitcoin              had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks. This would mainly depend on news as there has been a lot of negative news around cryptocurrencies. There is still a chance that the price may fall and test the  support level  once again but this could only be figured out over time. This is mainly due to the  RSI  being very close to oversold just as the price managed to get a little out of the  support zone .

I find the patterns here on the last two rallys eerily similar.  Two bumps against the top of the flag, then only a partial retrace down to the red box before it reaches the top for a 3rd time.  Then a bounce off the bottom and back and forth before another rally up.  

What do you think of that?  My initial 3rd wave projection appears to be off, and if the 4th wave drops any further, it will invalidate my EW count... but even though the wicks of the 4th wave and 1st wave overlap just a smidge, I'm keeping my count where it for now.

If the downtrend continues, I suspect $5k would offer support, with price reaching this level by mid August, followed by a rally.

Some resistance on the .236 fib. If we can break above here then the path to 7000-7100 will be clear.   MACD  has plenty of room to run after a  bullish  cross.   RSI  trending upwards, but has some room for regression.   

If we see a continuation, then we have 8000 lying conveniently on the golden fibonacci of .618.

Last week major cryptocurrencies changed in price a little, achieving new local minimums during the week.  Bitcoin -0.60%  achieved its minimum of $ 5’780 and by the close of the week managed to rise above key level of $ 6’000. Its share in total capitalization increased to 42,5%. 
The number of billionaire-coins is still 18 and their total number (according to https://coinmarketcap.com) has increased to 1’597. 
The total capitalization of cryptocurrencies grew to $ 256 billion. 

Bitcoin -0.60%  increased by 3% from $ 6’150 to $ 6’350 last week, the minimum was $ 5’780. 






The market has sagged to key level of $ 6’000 and has been consolidating near it. There has not been close of day and week under $ 6’000 yet. However, it is almost inevitable without active purchases. 
Until $ 9’000 is overcome, long-term technical picture remains  bearish . 

Ethereum -1.83%  decreased by further 0,6% from $ 455 to $ 452, the minimum was $ 405. 






Ethtereum made a new minimum in the beginning of the week. However, it ended the week at the initial rate. Medium-term downward trend has continued. The zone of long-term support is from $ 360 and lower. The rise above $ 800 will be a signal of growth resumption. 

Ripple (XRPUSD) decreased by further 4% from $ 0,48 to $ 0,46 with the minimum of $ 0,415. 






The decline has continued. New local minimum was reached. Testing of April minimum of around $ 0,45 has been going on. Its break will open the way to $ 0,2 - $ 0,25. The further decline is more likely. 

BCHUSD              decreased by further 1,2% from $ 747 to $ 738, the minimum was $ 646. 






The rate slowed down its incremental decline. However, there are no signs of turnaround and going up. The support is on $ 600 and $ 300. The resistance is $ 1’100 and then $ 1’800. The further decline is more likely. 

Litecoin fell by further 0,3% from $ 80,5 to $ 80,2, the minimum was $ 72. 






The key support near $ 100 is broken. There are no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 55 now. 

IOTA grew by 9% from $ 0,98 to $ 1,07 with the minimum of $ 0,89. 






IOTA did not manage to overcome the reached first decline target near $ 1 promptly. There was a rebound within very modest correction. The further gradual decrease to $ 0,33 is more likely. 

NEO is near $ 31 as it was with the minimum of $ 27.

This week the consolidation on reached levels is more likely. 

DASH declined by further 1% from $ 238 to $ 236, the minimum was $ 210.

Some resistance on the .236 fib. If we can break above here then the path to 7000-7100 will be clear.   MACD  has plenty of room to run after a  bullish  cross.   RSI  trending upwards, but has some room for regression.   

If we see a continuation, then we have 8000 lying conveniently on the golden fibonacci of .618.

1530632819.0,icexch,Weekly review of 10 major cryptocurrencies 24.06.18 - 01.07.18,"
Last week major cryptocurrencies changed in price a little, achieving new local minimums during the week.  Bitcoin              achieved its minimum of $ 5’780 and by the close of the week managed to rise above key level of $ 6’000. Its share in total capitalization increased to 42,5%. 
The number of billionaire-coins is still 18 and their total number (according to https://coinmarketcap.com) has increased to 1’597. 
The total capitalization of cryptocurrencies grew to $ 256 billion. 

Bitcoin              increased by 3% from $ 6’150 to $ 6’350 last week, the minimum was $ 5’780. 






The market has sagged to key level of $ 6’000 and has been consolidating near it. There has not been close of day and week under $ 6’000 yet. However, it is almost inevitable without active purchases. 
Until $ 9’000 is overcome, long-term technical picture remains  bearish . 

Ethereum              decreased by further 0,6% from $ 455 to $ 452, the minimum was $ 405. 






Ethtereum made a new minimum in the beginning of the week. However, it ended the week at the initial rate. Medium-term downward trend has continued. The zone of long-term support is from $ 360 and lower. The rise above $ 800 will be a signal of growth resumption. 

Ripple (XRPUSD) decreased by further 4% from $ 0,48 to $ 0,46 with the minimum of $ 0,415. 






The decline has continued. New local minimum was reached. Testing of April minimum of around $ 0,45 has been going on. Its break will open the way to $ 0,2 - $ 0,25. The further decline is more likely. 

BCHUSD              decreased by further 1,2% from $ 747 to $ 738, the minimum was $ 646. 






The rate slowed down its incremental decline. However, there are no signs of turnaround and going up. The support is on $ 600 and $ 300. The resistance is $ 1’100 and then $ 1’800. The further decline is more likely. 

Litecoin fell by further 0,3% from $ 80,5 to $ 80,2, the minimum was $ 72. 






The key support near $ 100 is broken. There are no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 55 now. 

IOTA grew by 9% from $ 0,98 to $ 1,07 with the minimum of $ 0,89. 






IOTA did not manage to overcome the reached first decline target near $ 1 promptly. There was a rebound within very modest correction. The further gradual decrease to $ 0,33 is more likely. 

NEO is near $ 31 as it was with the minimum of $ 27. 






The support near $ 45 was broken. There are now no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 22. The further decline is more likely. 

Monero grew a bit by 7,5% from $ 121 to $ 130, the minimum was $ 114. 






The support above $ 150 was broken. And the decline continued. But the new minimum was not reached. Probably the appeared purchases rebalanced market. 
This week the consolidation on reached levels is more likely. 

DASH declined by further 1% from $ 238 to $ 236, the minimum was $ 210. 






The fall reached the support near $ 220. 
However, it is more likely to just stopped its decrease for a while. The further decline is more likely. 

NEM              went up by 10% from $ 0,15 to $ 0,166 with the minimum of $ 0,14. 






Important support in $ 0,20 was broken. 
There are now no technical obstacles for decline to $ 0,1. The further decline is more likely.

As predicted in my last post  bitcoin -0.60%  has not been successful breaking the  support level  which has been standing since last year. The price of  bitcoin -0.60%  had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks. This would mainly depend on news as there has been a lot of negative news around cryptocurrencies. There is still a chance that the price may fall and test the  support level  once again but this could only be figured out over time. This is mainly due to the  RSI  being very close to oversold just as the price managed to get a little out of the  support zone .

I find the patterns here on the last two rallys eerily similar.  Two bumps against the top of the flag, then only a partial retrace down to the red box before it reaches the top for a 3rd time.  Then a bounce off the bottom and back and forth before another rally up.  

What do you think of that?  My initial 3rd wave projection appears to be off, and if the 4th wave drops any further, it will invalidate my EW count... but even though the wicks of the 4th wave and 1st wave overlap just a smidge, I'm keeping my count where it for now.  Another bounce off the bottom of the  bull flag  could trigger the 5th wave up to 6800-7000.

If the downtrend continues, I suspect $5k would offer support, with price reaching this level by mid August, followed by a rally. 

Bitcoin -0.60%  tends to rally in the 2nd half of the year, beginning in August.

As predicted in my last post  bitcoin              has not been successful breaking the  support level  which has been standing since last year. The price of  bitcoin              had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks. This would mainly depend on news as there has been a lot of negative news around cryptocurrencies. There is still a chance that the price may fall and test the  support level  once again but this could only be figured out over time. This is mainly due to the  RSI  being very close to oversold just as the price managed to get a little out of the  support zone .

I find the patterns here on the last two rallys eerily similar.  Two bumps against the top of the flag, then only a partial retrace down to the red box before it reaches the top for a 3rd time.  Then a bounce off the bottom and back and forth before another rally up.  

What do you think of that?  My initial 3rd wave projection appears to be off, and if the 4th wave drops any further, it will invalidate my EW count... but even though the wicks of the 4th wave and 1st wave overlap just a smidge, I'm keeping my count where it for now.

A sustained break above $7k would be near term  bullish  with potential to re-challenge $10k. 

If the downtrend continues, I suspect $5k would offer support, with price reaching this level by mid August, followed by a rally.

Some resistance on the .236 fib. If we can break above here then the path to 7000-7100 will be clear.   MACD  has plenty of room to run after a  bullish  cross.   RSI  trending upwards, but has some room for regression.   

If we see a continuation, then we have 8000 lying conveniently on the golden fibonacci of .618.

1530632819.0,icexch,Weekly review of 10 major cryptocurrencies 24.06.18 - 01.07.18,"
Last week major cryptocurrencies changed in price a little, achieving new local minimums during the week.  Bitcoin              achieved its minimum of $ 5’780 and by the close of the week managed to rise above key level of $ 6’000. Its share in total capitalization increased to 42,5%. 
The number of billionaire-coins is still 18 and their total number (according to https://coinmarketcap.com) has increased to 1’597. 
The total capitalization of cryptocurrencies grew to $ 256 billion. 

Bitcoin              increased by 3% from $ 6’150 to $ 6’350 last week, the minimum was $ 5’780. 






The market has sagged to key level of $ 6’000 and has been consolidating near it. There has not been close of day and week under $ 6’000 yet. However, it is almost inevitable without active purchases. 
Until $ 9’000 is overcome, long-term technical picture remains  bearish . 

Ethereum              decreased by further 0,6% from $ 455 to $ 452, the minimum was $ 405. 






Ethtereum made a new minimum in the beginning of the week. However, it ended the week at the initial rate. Medium-term downward trend has continued. The zone of long-term support is from $ 360 and lower. The rise above $ 800 will be a signal of growth resumption. 

Ripple (XRPUSD) decreased by further 4% from $ 0,48 to $ 0,46 with the minimum of $ 0,415. 






The decline has continued. New local minimum was reached. Testing of April minimum of around $ 0,45 has been going on. Its break will open the way to $ 0,2 - $ 0,25. The further decline is more likely. 

BCHUSD              decreased by further 1,2% from $ 747 to $ 738, the minimum was $ 646. 






The rate slowed down its incremental decline. However, there are no signs of turnaround and going up. The support is on $ 600 and $ 300. The resistance is $ 1’100 and then $ 1’800. The further decline is more likely. 

Litecoin fell by further 0,3% from $ 80,5 to $ 80,2, the minimum was $ 72. 






The key support near $ 100 is broken. There are no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 55 now. 

IOTA grew by 9% from $ 0,98 to $ 1,07 with the minimum of $ 0,89. 






IOTA did not manage to overcome the reached first decline target near $ 1 promptly. There was a rebound within very modest correction. The further gradual decrease to $ 0,33 is more likely. 

NEO is near $ 31 as it was with the minimum of $ 27. 






The support near $ 45 was broken. There are now no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 22. The further decline is more likely. 

Monero grew a bit by 7,5% from $ 121 to $ 130, the minimum was $ 114. 






The support above $ 150 was broken. And the decline continued. But the new minimum was not reached. Probably the appeared purchases rebalanced market. 
This week the consolidation on reached levels is more likely. 

DASH declined by further 1% from $ 238 to $ 236, the minimum was $ 210. 






The fall reached the support near $ 220. 
However, it is more likely to just stopped its decrease for a while. The further decline is more likely. 

NEM              went up by 10% from $ 0,15 to $ 0,166 with the minimum of $ 0,14. 






Important support in $ 0,20 was broken. 
There are now no technical obstacles for decline to $ 0,1. The further decline is more likely.

1530632819.0,icexch,Weekly review of 10 major cryptocurrencies 24.06.18 - 01.07.18,"
Last week major cryptocurrencies changed in price a little, achieving new local minimums during the week.  Bitcoin -0.67%  achieved its minimum of $ 5’780 and by the close of the week managed to rise above key level of $ 6’000. Its share in total capitalization increased to 42,5%. 
The number of billionaire-coins is still 18 and their total number (according to https://coinmarketcap.com) has increased to 1’597. 
The total capitalization of cryptocurrencies grew to $ 256 billion. 

Bitcoin -0.67%  increased by 3% from $ 6’150 to $ 6’350 last week, the minimum was $ 5’780. 






The market has sagged to key level of $ 6’000 and has been consolidating near it. There has not been close of day and week under $ 6’000 yet. However, it is almost inevitable without active purchases. 
Until $ 9’000 is overcome, long-term technical picture remains  bearish . 

Ethereum -2.00%  decreased by further 0,6% from $ 455 to $ 452, the minimum was $ 405. 






Ethtereum made a new minimum in the beginning of the week. However, it ended the week at the initial rate. Medium-term downward trend has continued. The zone of long-term support is from $ 360 and lower. The rise above $ 800 will be a signal of growth resumption. 

Ripple (XRPUSD) decreased by further 4% from $ 0,48 to $ 0,46 with the minimum of $ 0,415. 






The decline has continued. New local minimum was reached. Testing of April minimum of around $ 0,45 has been going on. Its break will open the way to $ 0,2 - $ 0,25. The further decline is more likely. 

BCHUSD -1.61%  decreased by further 1,2% from $ 747 to $ 738, the minimum was $ 646. 






The rate slowed down its incremental decline. However, there are no signs of turnaround and going up. The support is on $ 600 and $ 300. The resistance is $ 1’100 and then $ 1’800. The further decline is more likely. 

Litecoin fell by further 0,3% from $ 80,5 to $ 80,2, the minimum was $ 72. 






The key support near $ 100 is broken. There are no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 55 now. 

IOTA grew by 9% from $ 0,98 to $ 1,07 with the minimum of $ 0,89. 






IOTA did not manage to overcome the reached first decline target near $ 1 promptly. There was a rebound within very modest correction. The further gradual decrease to $ 0,33 is more likely. 

NEO is near $ 31 as it was with the minimum of $ 27. 






The support near $ 45 was broken. There are now no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 22. The further decline is more likely. 

Monero grew a bit by 7,5% from $ 121 to $ 130, the minimum was $ 114. 






The support above $ 150 was broken. And the decline continued. But the new minimum was not reached. Probably the appeared purchases rebalanced market. 
This week the consolidation on reached levels is more likely. 

DASH declined by further 1% from $ 238 to $ 236, the minimum was $ 210. 






The fall reached the support near $ 220. 
However, it is more likely to just stopped its decrease for a while. The further decline is more likely. 

NEM 0.37%  went up by 10% from $ 0,15 to $ 0,166 with the minimum of $ 0,14. 






Important support in $ 0,20 was broken.

1530631012.0,JohnnyPurtoy98,BTCUSD - Back up we go!,"
As predicted in my last post  bitcoin -0.67%  has not been successful breaking the  support level  which has been standing since last year. The price of  bitcoin -0.67%  had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks. This would mainly depend on news as there has been a lot of negative news around cryptocurrencies. There is still a chance that the price may fall and test the  support level  once again but this could only be figured out over time. This is mainly due to the  RSI  being very close to oversold just as the price managed to get a little out of the  support zone .

I find the patterns here on the last two rallys eerily similar.  Two bumps against the top of the flag, then only a partial retrace down to the red box before it reaches the top for a 3rd time.  Then a bounce off the bottom and back and forth before another rally up.  

What do you think of that?  My initial 3rd wave projection appears to be off, and if the 4th wave drops any further, it will invalidate my EW count... but even though the wicks of the 4th wave and 1st wave overlap just a smidge, I'm keeping my count where it for now.  Another bounce off the bottom of the  bull flag  could trigger the 5th wave up to 6800-7000.

A sustained break above $7k would be near term  bullish  with potential to re-challenge $10k. 

If the downtrend continues, I suspect $5k would offer support, with price reaching this level by mid August, followed by a rally. 

Bitcoin -0.67%  tends to rally in the 2nd half of the year, beginning in August.

As predicted in my last post  bitcoin -0.72%  has not been successful breaking the  support level  which has been standing since last year. The price of  bitcoin -0.72%  had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks. This would mainly depend on news as there has been a lot of negative news around cryptocurrencies. There is still a chance that the price may fall and test the  support level  once again but this could only be figured out over time. This is mainly due to the  RSI  being very close to oversold just as the price managed to get a little out of the  support zone .

I find the patterns here on the last two rallys eerily similar.  Two bumps against the top of the flag, then only a partial retrace down to the red box before it reaches the top for a 3rd time.  Then a bounce off the bottom and back and forth before another rally up.  

What do you think of that?  My initial 3rd wave projection appears to be off, and if the 4th wave drops any further, it will invalidate my EW count... but even though the wicks of the 4th wave and 1st wave overlap just a smidge, I'm keeping my count where it for now.

 Bitcoin              hasn't looked this strong in two months. 

A sustained break above $7k would be near term  bullish  with potential to re-challenge $10k. 

If the downtrend continues, I suspect $5k would offer support, with price reaching this level by mid August, followed by a rally.

1530632819.0,icexch,Weekly review of 10 major cryptocurrencies 24.06.18 - 01.07.18,"
Last week major cryptocurrencies changed in price a little, achieving new local minimums during the week.  Bitcoin              achieved its minimum of $ 5’780 and by the close of the week managed to rise above key level of $ 6’000. Its share in total capitalization increased to 42,5%. 
The number of billionaire-coins is still 18 and their total number (according to https://coinmarketcap.com) has increased to 1’597. 
The total capitalization of cryptocurrencies grew to $ 256 billion. 

Bitcoin              increased by 3% from $ 6’150 to $ 6’350 last week, the minimum was $ 5’780. 






The market has sagged to key level of $ 6’000 and has been consolidating near it. There has not been close of day and week under $ 6’000 yet. However, it is almost inevitable without active purchases. 
Until $ 9’000 is overcome, long-term technical picture remains  bearish . 

Ethereum              decreased by further 0,6% from $ 455 to $ 452, the minimum was $ 405. 






Ethtereum made a new minimum in the beginning of the week. However, it ended the week at the initial rate. Medium-term downward trend has continued. The zone of long-term support is from $ 360 and lower. The rise above $ 800 will be a signal of growth resumption. 

Ripple (XRPUSD) decreased by further 4% from $ 0,48 to $ 0,46 with the minimum of $ 0,415. 






The decline has continued. New local minimum was reached. Testing of April minimum of around $ 0,45 has been going on. Its break will open the way to $ 0,2 - $ 0,25. The further decline is more likely. 

BCHUSD              decreased by further 1,2% from $ 747 to $ 738, the minimum was $ 646. 






The rate slowed down its incremental decline. However, there are no signs of turnaround and going up. The support is on $ 600 and $ 300. The resistance is $ 1’100 and then $ 1’800. The further decline is more likely. 

Litecoin fell by further 0,3% from $ 80,5 to $ 80,2, the minimum was $ 72. 






The key support near $ 100 is broken. There are no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 55 now. 

IOTA grew by 9% from $ 0,98 to $ 1,07 with the minimum of $ 0,89. 






IOTA did not manage to overcome the reached first decline target near $ 1 promptly. There was a rebound within very modest correction. The further gradual decrease to $ 0,33 is more likely. 

NEO is near $ 31 as it was with the minimum of $ 27. 






The support near $ 45 was broken. There are now no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 22. The further decline is more likely. 

Monero grew a bit by 7,5% from $ 121 to $ 130, the minimum was $ 114. 






The support above $ 150 was broken. And the decline continued. But the new minimum was not reached. Probably the appeared purchases rebalanced market. 
This week the consolidation on reached levels is more likely. 

DASH declined by further 1% from $ 238 to $ 236, the minimum was $ 210. 






The fall reached the support near $ 220. 
However, it is more likely to just stopped its decrease for a while. The further decline is more likely. 

NEM              went up by 10% from $ 0,15 to $ 0,166 with the minimum of $ 0,14. 






Important support in $ 0,20 was broken. 
There are now no technical obstacles for decline to $ 0,1. The further decline is more likely.

Target not hit from yesterdays chart. I called closing price $6700-6900 due to  Bollinger Band  upper cloud opening but we ended up staying in the $6600 area 
Instead we had steady consolidation due to strong resistance which is good for alts.

1530632819.0,icexch,Weekly review of 10 major cryptocurrencies 24.06.18 - 01.07.18,"
Last week major cryptocurrencies changed in price a little, achieving new local minimums during the week.  Bitcoin -0.75%  achieved its minimum of $ 5’780 and by the close of the week managed to rise above key level of $ 6’000. Its share in total capitalization increased to 42,5%. 
The number of billionaire-coins is still 18 and their total number (according to https://coinmarketcap.com) has increased to 1’597. 
The total capitalization of cryptocurrencies grew to $ 256 billion. 

Bitcoin -0.75%  increased by 3% from $ 6’150 to $ 6’350 last week, the minimum was $ 5’780. 






The market has sagged to key level of $ 6’000 and has been consolidating near it. There has not been close of day and week under $ 6’000 yet. However, it is almost inevitable without active purchases. 
Until $ 9’000 is overcome, long-term technical picture remains  bearish . 

Ethereum -2.00%  decreased by further 0,6% from $ 455 to $ 452, the minimum was $ 405. 






Ethtereum made a new minimum in the beginning of the week. However, it ended the week at the initial rate. Medium-term downward trend has continued. The zone of long-term support is from $ 360 and lower. The rise above $ 800 will be a signal of growth resumption. 

Ripple (XRPUSD) decreased by further 4% from $ 0,48 to $ 0,46 with the minimum of $ 0,415. 






The decline has continued. New local minimum was reached. Testing of April minimum of around $ 0,45 has been going on. Its break will open the way to $ 0,2 - $ 0,25. The further decline is more likely. 

BCHUSD -1.76%  decreased by further 1,2% from $ 747 to $ 738, the minimum was $ 646. 






The rate slowed down its incremental decline. However, there are no signs of turnaround and going up. The support is on $ 600 and $ 300. The resistance is $ 1’100 and then $ 1’800. The further decline is more likely. 

Litecoin fell by further 0,3% from $ 80,5 to $ 80,2, the minimum was $ 72. 






The key support near $ 100 is broken. There are no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 55 now. 

IOTA grew by 9% from $ 0,98 to $ 1,07 with the minimum of $ 0,89. 






IOTA did not manage to overcome the reached first decline target near $ 1 promptly. There was a rebound within very modest correction. The further gradual decrease to $ 0,33 is more likely. 

NEO is near $ 31 as it was with the minimum of $ 27. 






The support near $ 45 was broken. There are now no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 22. The further decline is more likely. 

Monero grew a bit by 7,5% from $ 121 to $ 130, the minimum was $ 114. 






The support above $ 150 was broken. And the decline continued. But the new minimum was not reached. Probably the appeared purchases rebalanced market. 
This week the consolidation on reached levels is more likely. 

DASH declined by further 1% from $ 238 to $ 236, the minimum was $ 210. 






The fall reached the support near $ 220. 
However, it is more likely to just stopped its decrease for a while. The further decline is more likely. 

NEM              went up by 10% from $ 0,15 to $ 0,166 with the minimum of $ 0,14. 






Important support in $ 0,20 was broken. 
There are now no technical obstacles for decline to $ 0,1. The further decline is more likely.

1530631012.0,JohnnyPurtoy98,BTCUSD - Back up we go!,"
As predicted in my last post  bitcoin -0.75%  has not been successful breaking the  support level  which has been standing since last year. The price of  bitcoin -0.75%  had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks. This would mainly depend on news as there has been a lot of negative news around cryptocurrencies. There is still a chance that the price may fall and test the  support level  once again but this could only be figured out over time. This is mainly due to the  RSI  being very close to oversold just as the price managed to get a little out of the  support zone .

The  bullish  scenario would be for  BTC -0.75%  to hold its gains and for a  flag pattern  to form at its current level. If followed by strong  volume  coming in, we may see  BTC -0.75%  looking to retest 8000.

1530634846.0,bluemt95,Similar Pattern?  Still heading up in a bull flag?,"
I find the patterns here on the last two rallys eerily similar.  Two bumps against the top of the flag, then only a partial retrace down to the red box before it reaches the top for a 3rd time.  Then a bounce off the bottom and back and forth before another rally up.  

What do you think of that?  My initial 3rd wave projection appears to be off, and if the 4th wave drops any further, it will invalidate my EW count... but even though the wicks of the 4th wave and 1st wave overlap just a smidge, I'm keeping my count where it for now.  Another bounce off the bottom of the  bull flag  could trigger the 5th wave up to 6800-7000.

 Bitcoin              hasn't looked this strong in two months. 

A sustained break above $7k would be near term  bullish  with potential to re-challenge $10k. 

If the downtrend continues, I suspect $5k would offer support, with price reaching this level by mid August, followed by a rally. 

Bitcoin              tends to rally in the 2nd half of the year, beginning in August. 

As always,  bullish  on  bitcoin              long term.  The internet can and will have it's own currency.

Some resistance on the .236 fib. If we can break above here then the path to 7000-7100 will be clear.   MACD  has plenty of room to run after a  bullish  cross.   RSI  trending upwards, but has some room for regression.   

If we see a continuation, then we have 8000 lying conveniently on the golden fibonacci of .618.  

The breakout is strongly confirmed on the daily. The only likely  bearish  option that I see here is the formation of a  parallel channel .

1530632819.0,icexch,Weekly review of 10 major cryptocurrencies 24.06.18 - 01.07.18,"
Last week major cryptocurrencies changed in price a little, achieving new local minimums during the week.  Bitcoin -0.77%  achieved its minimum of $ 5’780 and by the close of the week managed to rise above key level of $ 6’000. Its share in total capitalization increased to 42,5%. 
The number of billionaire-coins is still 18 and their total number (according to https://coinmarketcap.com) has increased to 1’597. 
The total capitalization of cryptocurrencies grew to $ 256 billion. 

Bitcoin -0.77%  increased by 3% from $ 6’150 to $ 6’350 last week, the minimum was $ 5’780. 






The market has sagged to key level of $ 6’000 and has been consolidating near it. There has not been close of day and week under $ 6’000 yet. However, it is almost inevitable without active purchases. 
Until $ 9’000 is overcome, long-term technical picture remains  bearish . 

Ethereum -2.05%  decreased by further 0,6% from $ 455 to $ 452, the minimum was $ 405. 






Ethtereum made a new minimum in the beginning of the week. However, it ended the week at the initial rate. Medium-term downward trend has continued. The zone of long-term support is from $ 360 and lower. The rise above $ 800 will be a signal of growth resumption. 

Ripple (XRPUSD) decreased by further 4% from $ 0,48 to $ 0,46 with the minimum of $ 0,415. 






The decline has continued. New local minimum was reached. Testing of April minimum of around $ 0,45 has been going on. Its break will open the way to $ 0,2 - $ 0,25. The further decline is more likely. 

BCHUSD -1.76%  decreased by further 1,2% from $ 747 to $ 738, the minimum was $ 646. 






The rate slowed down its incremental decline. However, there are no signs of turnaround and going up. The support is on $ 600 and $ 300. The resistance is $ 1’100 and then $ 1’800. The further decline is more likely. 

Litecoin fell by further 0,3% from $ 80,5 to $ 80,2, the minimum was $ 72. 






The key support near $ 100 is broken. There are no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 55 now. 

IOTA grew by 9% from $ 0,98 to $ 1,07 with the minimum of $ 0,89. 






IOTA did not manage to overcome the reached first decline target near $ 1 promptly. There was a rebound within very modest correction. The further gradual decrease to $ 0,33 is more likely. 

NEO is near $ 31 as it was with the minimum of $ 27. 






The support near $ 45 was broken. There are now no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 22. The further decline is more likely. 

Monero grew a bit by 7,5% from $ 121 to $ 130, the minimum was $ 114. 






The support above $ 150 was broken. And the decline continued. But the new minimum was not reached. Probably the appeared purchases rebalanced market. 
This week the consolidation on reached levels is more likely. 

DASH declined by further 1% from $ 238 to $ 236, the minimum was $ 210. 






The fall reached the support near $ 220. 
However, it is more likely to just stopped its decrease for a while. The further decline is more likely. 

NEM              went up by 10% from $ 0,15 to $ 0,166 with the minimum of $ 0,14. 






Important support in $ 0,20 was broken. 
There are now no technical obstacles for decline to $ 0,1. The further decline is more likely.

The price of  bitcoin -0.77%  had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks.

1530632819.0,icexch,Weekly review of 10 major cryptocurrencies 24.06.18 - 01.07.18,"
Last week major cryptocurrencies changed in price a little, achieving new local minimums during the week.  Bitcoin              achieved its minimum of $ 5’780 and by the close of the week managed to rise above key level of $ 6’000. Its share in total capitalization increased to 42,5%. 
The number of billionaire-coins is still 18 and their total number (according to https://coinmarketcap.com) has increased to 1’597. 
The total capitalization of cryptocurrencies grew to $ 256 billion. 

Bitcoin              increased by 3% from $ 6’150 to $ 6’350 last week, the minimum was $ 5’780. 






The market has sagged to key level of $ 6’000 and has been consolidating near it. There has not been close of day and week under $ 6’000 yet. However, it is almost inevitable without active purchases. 
Until $ 9’000 is overcome, long-term technical picture remains  bearish . 

Ethereum              decreased by further 0,6% from $ 455 to $ 452, the minimum was $ 405. 






Ethtereum made a new minimum in the beginning of the week. However, it ended the week at the initial rate. Medium-term downward trend has continued. The zone of long-term support is from $ 360 and lower. The rise above $ 800 will be a signal of growth resumption. 

Ripple (XRPUSD) decreased by further 4% from $ 0,48 to $ 0,46 with the minimum of $ 0,415. 






The decline has continued. New local minimum was reached. Testing of April minimum of around $ 0,45 has been going on. Its break will open the way to $ 0,2 - $ 0,25. The further decline is more likely. 

BCHUSD              decreased by further 1,2% from $ 747 to $ 738, the minimum was $ 646. 






The rate slowed down its incremental decline. However, there are no signs of turnaround and going up. The support is on $ 600 and $ 300. The resistance is $ 1’100 and then $ 1’800. The further decline is more likely. 

Litecoin fell by further 0,3% from $ 80,5 to $ 80,2, the minimum was $ 72. 






The key support near $ 100 is broken. There are no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 55 now. 

IOTA grew by 9% from $ 0,98 to $ 1,07 with the minimum of $ 0,89. 






IOTA did not manage to overcome the reached first decline target near $ 1 promptly. There was a rebound within very modest correction. The further gradual decrease to $ 0,33 is more likely. 

NEO is near $ 31 as it was with the minimum of $ 27. 






The support near $ 45 was broken. There are now no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 22. The further decline is more likely. 

Monero grew a bit by 7,5% from $ 121 to $ 130, the minimum was $ 114. 






The support above $ 150 was broken. And the decline continued. But the new minimum was not reached. Probably the appeared purchases rebalanced market. 
This week the consolidation on reached levels is more likely. 

DASH declined by further 1% from $ 238 to $ 236, the minimum was $ 210. 






The fall reached the support near $ 220. 
However, it is more likely to just stopped its decrease for a while. The further decline is more likely. 

NEM              went up by 10% from $ 0,15 to $ 0,166 with the minimum of $ 0,14. 






Important support in $ 0,20 was broken. 
There are now no technical obstacles for decline to $ 0,1. The further decline is more likely.

As predicted in my last post  bitcoin -0.68%  has not been successful breaking the  support level  which has been standing since last year. The price of  bitcoin -0.68%  had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks. This would mainly depend on news as there has been a lot of negative news around cryptocurrencies. There is still a chance that the price may fall and test the  support level  once again but this could only be figured out over time. This is mainly due to the  RSI  being very close to oversold just as the price managed to get a little out of the  support zone .

1530634846.0,bluemt95,Similar Pattern?  Still heading up in a bull flag?,"
I find the patterns here on the last two rallys eerily similar.  Two bumps against the top of the flag, then only a partial retrace down to the red box before it reaches the top for a 3rd time.  Then a bounce off the bottom and back and forth before another rally up.  

What do you think of that?  My initial 3rd wave projection appears to be off, and if the 4th wave drops any further, it will invalidate my EW count... but even though the wicks of the 4th wave and 1st wave overlap just a smidge, I'm keeping my count where it for now.  Another bounce off the bottom of the  bull flag  could trigger the 5th wave up to 6800-7000.

 Bitcoin              hasn't looked this strong in two months. 

A sustained break above $7k would be near term  bullish  with potential to re-challenge $10k. 

If the downtrend continues, I suspect $5k would offer support, with price reaching this level by mid August, followed by a rally. 

Bitcoin              tends to rally in the 2nd half of the year, beginning in August. 

As always,  bullish  on  bitcoin              long term.  The internet can and will have it's own currency.

Some resistance on the .236 fib. If we can break above here then the path to 7000-7100 will be clear.   MACD  has plenty of room to run after a  bullish  cross.   RSI  trending upwards, but has some room for regression.   

If we see a continuation, then we have 8000 lying conveniently on the golden fibonacci of .618.  

The breakout is strongly confirmed on the daily. The only likely  bearish  option that I see here is the formation of a  parallel channel .

The  bullish  scenario would be for  BTC -0.67%  to hold its gains and for a  flag pattern  to form at its current level. If followed by strong  volume  coming in, we may see  BTC -0.67%  looking to retest 8000.

I find the patterns here on the last two rallys eerily similar.  Two bumps against the top of the flag, then only a partial retrace down to the red box before it reaches the top for a 3rd time.  Then a bounce off the bottom and back and forth before another rally up.  

What do you think of that?  My initial 3rd wave projection appears to be off, and if the 4th wave drops any further, it will invalidate my EW count... but even though the wicks of the 4th wave and 1st wave overlap just a smidge, I'm keeping my count where it for now.

 Bitcoin              hasn't looked this strong in two months. 

A sustained break above $7k would be near term  bullish  with potential to re-challenge $10k. 

If the downtrend continues, I suspect $5k would offer support, with price reaching this level by mid August, followed by a rally.

1530632819.0,icexch,Weekly review of 10 major cryptocurrencies 24.06.18 - 01.07.18,"
Last week major cryptocurrencies changed in price a little, achieving new local minimums during the week.  Bitcoin              achieved its minimum of $ 5’780 and by the close of the week managed to rise above key level of $ 6’000. Its share in total capitalization increased to 42,5%. 
The number of billionaire-coins is still 18 and their total number (according to https://coinmarketcap.com) has increased to 1’597. 
The total capitalization of cryptocurrencies grew to $ 256 billion. 

Bitcoin              increased by 3% from $ 6’150 to $ 6’350 last week, the minimum was $ 5’780. 






The market has sagged to key level of $ 6’000 and has been consolidating near it. There has not been close of day and week under $ 6’000 yet. However, it is almost inevitable without active purchases. 
Until $ 9’000 is overcome, long-term technical picture remains  bearish . 

Ethereum              decreased by further 0,6% from $ 455 to $ 452, the minimum was $ 405. 






Ethtereum made a new minimum in the beginning of the week. However, it ended the week at the initial rate. Medium-term downward trend has continued. The zone of long-term support is from $ 360 and lower. The rise above $ 800 will be a signal of growth resumption. 

Ripple (XRPUSD) decreased by further 4% from $ 0,48 to $ 0,46 with the minimum of $ 0,415. 






The decline has continued. New local minimum was reached. Testing of April minimum of around $ 0,45 has been going on. Its break will open the way to $ 0,2 - $ 0,25. The further decline is more likely. 

BCHUSD              decreased by further 1,2% from $ 747 to $ 738, the minimum was $ 646. 






The rate slowed down its incremental decline. However, there are no signs of turnaround and going up. The support is on $ 600 and $ 300. The resistance is $ 1’100 and then $ 1’800. The further decline is more likely. 

Litecoin fell by further 0,3% from $ 80,5 to $ 80,2, the minimum was $ 72. 






The key support near $ 100 is broken. There are no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 55 now. 

IOTA grew by 9% from $ 0,98 to $ 1,07 with the minimum of $ 0,89. 






IOTA did not manage to overcome the reached first decline target near $ 1 promptly. There was a rebound within very modest correction. The further gradual decrease to $ 0,33 is more likely. 

NEO is near $ 31 as it was with the minimum of $ 27. 






The support near $ 45 was broken. There are now no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 22. The further decline is more likely. 

Monero grew a bit by 7,5% from $ 121 to $ 130, the minimum was $ 114. 






The support above $ 150 was broken. And the decline continued. But the new minimum was not reached. Probably the appeared purchases rebalanced market. 
This week the consolidation on reached levels is more likely. 

DASH declined by further 1% from $ 238 to $ 236, the minimum was $ 210. 






The fall reached the support near $ 220. 
However, it is more likely to just stopped its decrease for a while. The further decline is more likely. 

NEM              went up by 10% from $ 0,15 to $ 0,166 with the minimum of $ 0,14. 






Important support in $ 0,20 was broken. 
There are now no technical obstacles for decline to $ 0,1. The further decline is more likely.

As predicted in my last post  bitcoin              has not been successful breaking the  support level  which has been standing since last year. The price of  bitcoin              had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks. This would mainly depend on news as there has been a lot of negative news around cryptocurrencies. There is still a chance that the price may fall and test the  support level  once again but this could only be figured out over time. This is mainly due to the  RSI  being very close to oversold just as the price managed to get a little out of the  support zone .

Last week major cryptocurrencies changed in price a little, achieving new local minimums during the week.  Bitcoin -0.61%  achieved its minimum of $ 5’780 and by the close of the week managed to rise above key level of $ 6’000. Its share in total capitalization increased to 42,5%. 
The number of billionaire-coins is still 18 and their total number (according to https://coinmarketcap.com) has increased to 1’597. 
The total capitalization of cryptocurrencies grew to $ 256 billion. 

Bitcoin -0.61%  increased by 3% from $ 6’150 to $ 6’350 last week, the minimum was $ 5’780. 






The market has sagged to key level of $ 6’000 and has been consolidating near it. There has not been close of day and week under $ 6’000 yet. However, it is almost inevitable without active purchases. 
Until $ 9’000 is overcome, long-term technical picture remains  bearish . 

Ethereum -1.77%  decreased by further 0,6% from $ 455 to $ 452, the minimum was $ 405. 






Ethtereum made a new minimum in the beginning of the week. However, it ended the week at the initial rate. Medium-term downward trend has continued. The zone of long-term support is from $ 360 and lower. The rise above $ 800 will be a signal of growth resumption. 

Ripple (XRPUSD) decreased by further 4% from $ 0,48 to $ 0,46 with the minimum of $ 0,415. 






The decline has continued. New local minimum was reached. Testing of April minimum of around $ 0,45 has been going on. Its break will open the way to $ 0,2 - $ 0,25. The further decline is more likely. 

BCHUSD -1.42%  decreased by further 1,2% from $ 747 to $ 738, the minimum was $ 646. 






The rate slowed down its incremental decline. However, there are no signs of turnaround and going up. The support is on $ 600 and $ 300. The resistance is $ 1’100 and then $ 1’800. The further decline is more likely. 

Litecoin fell by further 0,3% from $ 80,5 to $ 80,2, the minimum was $ 72. 






The key support near $ 100 is broken. There are no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 55 now. 

IOTA grew by 9% from $ 0,98 to $ 1,07 with the minimum of $ 0,89. 






IOTA did not manage to overcome the reached first decline target near $ 1 promptly. There was a rebound within very modest correction. The further gradual decrease to $ 0,33 is more likely. 

NEO is near $ 31 as it was with the minimum of $ 27. 






The support near $ 45 was broken. There are now no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 22. The further decline is more likely. 

Monero grew a bit by 7,5% from $ 121 to $ 130, the minimum was $ 114. 






The support above $ 150 was broken. And the decline continued. But the new minimum was not reached. Probably the appeared purchases rebalanced market. 
This week the consolidation on reached levels is more likely. 

DASH declined by further 1% from $ 238 to $ 236, the minimum was $ 210. 






The fall reached the support near $ 220. 
However, it is more likely to just stopped its decrease for a while. The further decline is more likely. 

NEM 0.24%  went up by 10% from $ 0,15 to $ 0,166 with the minimum of $ 0,14. 






Important support in $ 0,20 was broken. 
There are now no technical obstacles for decline to $ 0,1. The further decline is more likely.

As predicted in my last post  bitcoin -0.61%  has not been successful breaking the  support level  which has been standing since last year. The price of  bitcoin -0.61%  had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks. This would mainly depend on news as there has been a lot of negative news around cryptocurrencies. There is still a chance that the price may fall and test the  support level  once again but this could only be figured out over time. This is mainly due to the  RSI  being very close to oversold just as the price managed to get a little out of the  support zone .

1530634846.0,bluemt95,Similar Pattern?  Still heading up in a bull flag?,"
I find the patterns here on the last two rallys eerily similar.  Two bumps against the top of the flag, then only a partial retrace down to the red box before it reaches the top for a 3rd time.  Then a bounce off the bottom and back and forth before another rally up.  

What do you think of that?  My initial 3rd wave projection appears to be off, and if the 4th wave drops any further, it will invalidate my EW count... but even though the wicks of the 4th wave and 1st wave overlap just a smidge, I'm keeping my count where it for now.  Another bounce off the bottom of the  bull flag  could trigger the 5th wave up to 6800-7000.

 Bitcoin -0.61%  hasn't looked this strong in two months. 

A sustained break above $7k would be near term  bullish  with potential to re-challenge $10k. 

If the downtrend continues, I suspect $5k would offer support, with price reaching this level by mid August, followed by a rally. 

Bitcoin -0.61%  tends to rally in the 2nd half of the year, beginning in August. 

As always,  bullish  on  bitcoin -0.61%  long term.  The internet can and will have it's own currency.

Some resistance on the .236 fib. If we can break above here then the path to 7000-7100 will be clear.   MACD  has plenty of room to run after a  bullish  cross.   RSI  trending upwards, but has some room for regression.   

If we see a continuation, then we have 8000 lying conveniently on the golden fibonacci of .618.  

The breakout is strongly confirmed on the daily. The only likely  bearish  option that I see here is the formation of a  parallel channel .

1530632819.0,icexch,Weekly review of 10 major cryptocurrencies 24.06.18 - 01.07.18,"
Last week major cryptocurrencies changed in price a little, achieving new local minimums during the week.  Bitcoin -0.61%  achieved its minimum of $ 5’780 and by the close of the week managed to rise above key level of $ 6’000. Its share in total capitalization increased to 42,5%. 
The number of billionaire-coins is still 18 and their total number (according to https://coinmarketcap.com) has increased to 1’597. 
The total capitalization of cryptocurrencies grew to $ 256 billion. 

Bitcoin -0.61%  increased by 3% from $ 6’150 to $ 6’350 last week, the minimum was $ 5’780. 






The market has sagged to key level of $ 6’000 and has been consolidating near it. There has not been close of day and week under $ 6’000 yet. However, it is almost inevitable without active purchases. 
Until $ 9’000 is overcome, long-term technical picture remains  bearish . 

Ethereum -1.93%  decreased by further 0,6% from $ 455 to $ 452, the minimum was $ 405. 






Ethtereum made a new minimum in the beginning of the week. However, it ended the week at the initial rate. Medium-term downward trend has continued. The zone of long-term support is from $ 360 and lower. The rise above $ 800 will be a signal of growth resumption. 

Ripple (XRPUSD) decreased by further 4% from $ 0,48 to $ 0,46 with the minimum of $ 0,415. 






The decline has continued. New local minimum was reached. Testing of April minimum of around $ 0,45 has been going on. Its break will open the way to $ 0,2 - $ 0,25. The further decline is more likely. 

BCHUSD -1.42%  decreased by further 1,2% from $ 747 to $ 738, the minimum was $ 646. 






The rate slowed down its incremental decline. However, there are no signs of turnaround and going up. The support is on $ 600 and $ 300. The resistance is $ 1’100 and then $ 1’800. The further decline is more likely. 

Litecoin fell by further 0,3% from $ 80,5 to $ 80,2, the minimum was $ 72. 






The key support near $ 100 is broken. There are no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 55 now. 

IOTA grew by 9% from $ 0,98 to $ 1,07 with the minimum of $ 0,89. 






IOTA did not manage to overcome the reached first decline target near $ 1 promptly. There was a rebound within very modest correction. The further gradual decrease to $ 0,33 is more likely. 

NEO is near $ 31 as it was with the minimum of $ 27. 






The support near $ 45 was broken. There are now no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 22. The further decline is more likely. 

Monero grew a bit by 7,5% from $ 121 to $ 130, the minimum was $ 114. 






The support above $ 150 was broken. And the decline continued. But the new minimum was not reached. Probably the appeared purchases rebalanced market. 
This week the consolidation on reached levels is more likely. 

DASH declined by further 1% from $ 238 to $ 236, the minimum was $ 210. 






The fall reached the support near $ 220. 
However, it is more likely to just stopped its decrease for a while. The further decline is more likely. 

NEM              went up by 10% from $ 0,15 to $ 0,166 with the minimum of $ 0,14. 






Important support in $ 0,20 was broken. 
There are now no technical obstacles for decline to $ 0,1. The further decline is more likely.

As predicted in my last post  bitcoin -0.61%  has not been successful breaking the  support level  which has been standing since last year. The price of  bitcoin -0.61%  had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks. This would mainly depend on news as there has been a lot of negative news around cryptocurrencies. There is still a chance that the price may fall and test the  support level  once again but this could only be figured out over time. This is mainly due to the  RSI  being very close to oversold just as the price managed to get a little out of the  support zone .

As predicted in my last post  bitcoin -0.57%  has not been successful breaking the  support level  which has been standing since last year. The price of  bitcoin -0.57%  had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks. This would mainly depend on news as there has been a lot of negative news around cryptocurrencies. There is still a chance that the price may fall and test the  support level  once again but this could only be figured out over time. This is mainly due to the  RSI  being very close to oversold just as the price managed to get a little out of the  support zone .

I find the patterns here on the last two rallys eerily similar.  Two bumps against the top of the flag, then only a partial retrace down to the red box before it reaches the top for a 3rd time.  Then a bounce off the bottom and back and forth before another rally up.  

What do you think of that?  My initial 3rd wave projection appears to be off, and if the 4th wave drops any further, it will invalidate my EW count... but even though the wicks of the 4th wave and 1st wave overlap just a smidge, I'm keeping my count where it for now.  Another bounce off the bottom of the  bull flag  could trigger the 5th wave up to 6800-7000.

A sustained break above $7k would be near term  bullish  with potential to re-challenge $10k. 

If the downtrend continues, I suspect $5k would offer support, with price reaching this level by mid August, followed by a rally. 

Bitcoin -0.57%  tends to rally in the 2nd half of the year, beginning in August.

Some resistance on the .236 fib. If we can break above here then the path to 7000-7100 will be clear.   MACD  has plenty of room to run after a  bullish  cross.   RSI  trending upwards, but has some room for regression.   

If we see a continuation, then we have 8000 lying conveniently on the golden fibonacci of .618.

What do you think of that?  My initial 3rd wave projection appears to be off, and if the 4th wave drops any further, it will invalidate my EW count... but even though the wicks of the 4th wave and 1st wave overlap just a smidge, I'm keeping my count where it for now.

 Bitcoin              hasn't looked this strong in two months. 

A sustained break above $7k would be near term  bullish  with potential to re-challenge $10k. 

If the downtrend continues, I suspect $5k would offer support, with price reaching this level by mid August, followed by a rally.

Last week major cryptocurrencies changed in price a little, achieving new local minimums during the week.  Bitcoin -0.57%  achieved its minimum of $ 5’780 and by the close of the week managed to rise above key level of $ 6’000. Its share in total capitalization increased to 42,5%. 
The number of billionaire-coins is still 18 and their total number (according to https://coinmarketcap.com) has increased to 1’597. 
The total capitalization of cryptocurrencies grew to $ 256 billion. 

Bitcoin -0.57%  increased by 3% from $ 6’150 to $ 6’350 last week, the minimum was $ 5’780. 






The market has sagged to key level of $ 6’000 and has been consolidating near it. There has not been close of day and week under $ 6’000 yet. However, it is almost inevitable without active purchases. 
Until $ 9’000 is overcome, long-term technical picture remains  bearish . 

Ethereum -1.93%  decreased by further 0,6% from $ 455 to $ 452, the minimum was $ 405. 






Ethtereum made a new minimum in the beginning of the week. However, it ended the week at the initial rate. Medium-term downward trend has continued. The zone of long-term support is from $ 360 and lower. The rise above $ 800 will be a signal of growth resumption. 

Ripple (XRPUSD) decreased by further 4% from $ 0,48 to $ 0,46 with the minimum of $ 0,415. 






The decline has continued. New local minimum was reached. Testing of April minimum of around $ 0,45 has been going on. Its break will open the way to $ 0,2 - $ 0,25. The further decline is more likely. 

BCHUSD              decreased by further 1,2% from $ 747 to $ 738, the minimum was $ 646. 






The rate slowed down its incremental decline. However, there are no signs of turnaround and going up. The support is on $ 600 and $ 300. The resistance is $ 1’100 and then $ 1’800. The further decline is more likely. 

Litecoin fell by further 0,3% from $ 80,5 to $ 80,2, the minimum was $ 72. 






The key support near $ 100 is broken. There are no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 55 now. 

IOTA grew by 9% from $ 0,98 to $ 1,07 with the minimum of $ 0,89. 






IOTA did not manage to overcome the reached first decline target near $ 1 promptly. There was a rebound within very modest correction. The further gradual decrease to $ 0,33 is more likely. 

NEO is near $ 31 as it was with the minimum of $ 27. 






The support near $ 45 was broken. There are now no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 22. The further decline is more likely. 

Monero grew a bit by 7,5% from $ 121 to $ 130, the minimum was $ 114. 






The support above $ 150 was broken. And the decline continued. But the new minimum was not reached. Probably the appeared purchases rebalanced market. 
This week the consolidation on reached levels is more likely. 

DASH declined by further 1% from $ 238 to $ 236, the minimum was $ 210. 






The fall reached the support near $ 220. 
However, it is more likely to just stopped its decrease for a while. The further decline is more likely. 

NEM              went up by 10% from $ 0,15 to $ 0,166 with the minimum of $ 0,14. 






Important support in $ 0,20 was broken. 
There are now no technical obstacles for decline to $ 0,1. The further decline is more likely.

As predicted in my last post  bitcoin -0.57%  has not been successful breaking the  support level  which has been standing since last year. The price of  bitcoin -0.57%  had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks. This would mainly depend on news as there has been a lot of negative news around cryptocurrencies. There is still a chance that the price may fall and test the  support level  once again but this could only be figured out over time. This is mainly due to the  RSI  being very close to oversold just as the price managed to get a little out of the  support zone .

As predicted in my last post  bitcoin -0.57%  has not been successful breaking the  support level  which has been standing since last year. The price of  bitcoin -0.57%  had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks. This would mainly depend on news as there has been a lot of negative news around cryptocurrencies. There is still a chance that the price may fall and test the  support level  once again but this could only be figured out over time. This is mainly due to the  RSI  being very close to oversold just as the price managed to get a little out of the  support zone .

I find the patterns here on the last two rallys eerily similar.  Two bumps against the top of the flag, then only a partial retrace down to the red box before it reaches the top for a 3rd time.  Then a bounce off the bottom and back and forth before another rally up.  

What do you think of that?  My initial 3rd wave projection appears to be off, and if the 4th wave drops any further, it will invalidate my EW count... but even though the wicks of the 4th wave and 1st wave overlap just a smidge, I'm keeping my count where it for now.

A sustained break above $7k would be near term  bullish  with potential to re-challenge $10k. 

If the downtrend continues, I suspect $5k would offer support, with price reaching this level by mid August, followed by a rally.

Some resistance on the .236 fib. If we can break above here then the path to 7000-7100 will be clear.   MACD  has plenty of room to run after a  bullish  cross.   RSI  trending upwards, but has some room for regression.   

If we see a continuation, then we have 8000 lying conveniently on the golden fibonacci of .618.

Last week major cryptocurrencies changed in price a little, achieving new local minimums during the week.  Bitcoin -0.57%  achieved its minimum of $ 5’780 and by the close of the week managed to rise above key level of $ 6’000. Its share in total capitalization increased to 42,5%.

Bitcoin -0.57%  increased by 3% from $ 6’150 to $ 6’350 last week, the minimum was $ 5’780. 






The market has sagged to key level of $ 6’000 and has been consolidating near it. There has not been close of day and week under $ 6’000 yet. However, it is almost inevitable without active purchases. 
Until $ 9’000 is overcome, long-term technical picture remains  bearish .

BCHUSD -1.50%  decreased by further 1,2% from $ 747 to $ 738, the minimum was $ 646.

The key support near $ 100 is broken. There are no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 55 now. 

IOTA grew by 9% from $ 0,98 to $ 1,07 with the minimum of $ 0,89.

 Bitcoin              hasn't looked this strong in two months. 

A sustained break above $7k would be near term  bullish  with potential to re-challenge $10k. 

If the downtrend continues, I suspect $5k would offer support, with price reaching this level by mid August, followed by a rally.

Some resistance on the .236 fib. If we can break above here then the path to 7000-7100 will be clear.   MACD  has plenty of room to run after a  bullish  cross.   RSI  trending upwards, but has some room for regression.   

If we see a continuation, then we have 8000 lying conveniently on the golden fibonacci of .618.

1530632819.0,icexch,Weekly review of 10 major cryptocurrencies 24.06.18 - 01.07.18,"
Last week major cryptocurrencies changed in price a little, achieving new local minimums during the week.  Bitcoin              achieved its minimum of $ 5’780 and by the close of the week managed to rise above key level of $ 6’000. Its share in total capitalization increased to 42,5%. 
The number of billionaire-coins is still 18 and their total number (according to https://coinmarketcap.com) has increased to 1’597. 
The total capitalization of cryptocurrencies grew to $ 256 billion. 

Bitcoin              increased by 3% from $ 6’150 to $ 6’350 last week, the minimum was $ 5’780. 






The market has sagged to key level of $ 6’000 and has been consolidating near it. There has not been close of day and week under $ 6’000 yet. However, it is almost inevitable without active purchases. 
Until $ 9’000 is overcome, long-term technical picture remains  bearish . 

Ethereum              decreased by further 0,6% from $ 455 to $ 452, the minimum was $ 405. 






Ethtereum made a new minimum in the beginning of the week. However, it ended the week at the initial rate. Medium-term downward trend has continued. The zone of long-term support is from $ 360 and lower. The rise above $ 800 will be a signal of growth resumption. 

Ripple (XRPUSD) decreased by further 4% from $ 0,48 to $ 0,46 with the minimum of $ 0,415. 






The decline has continued. New local minimum was reached. Testing of April minimum of around $ 0,45 has been going on. Its break will open the way to $ 0,2 - $ 0,25. The further decline is more likely. 

BCHUSD              decreased by further 1,2% from $ 747 to $ 738, the minimum was $ 646. 






The rate slowed down its incremental decline. However, there are no signs of turnaround and going up. The support is on $ 600 and $ 300. The resistance is $ 1’100 and then $ 1’800. The further decline is more likely. 

Litecoin fell by further 0,3% from $ 80,5 to $ 80,2, the minimum was $ 72. 






The key support near $ 100 is broken. There are no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 55 now. 

IOTA grew by 9% from $ 0,98 to $ 1,07 with the minimum of $ 0,89. 






IOTA did not manage to overcome the reached first decline target near $ 1 promptly. There was a rebound within very modest correction. The further gradual decrease to $ 0,33 is more likely. 

NEO is near $ 31 as it was with the minimum of $ 27. 






The support near $ 45 was broken. There are now no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 22. The further decline is more likely. 

Monero grew a bit by 7,5% from $ 121 to $ 130, the minimum was $ 114. 






The support above $ 150 was broken. And the decline continued. But the new minimum was not reached. Probably the appeared purchases rebalanced market. 
This week the consolidation on reached levels is more likely. 

DASH declined by further 1% from $ 238 to $ 236, the minimum was $ 210. 






The fall reached the support near $ 220. 
However, it is more likely to just stopped its decrease for a while. The further decline is more likely. 

NEM              went up by 10% from $ 0,15 to $ 0,166 with the minimum of $ 0,14. 






Important support in $ 0,20 was broken. 
There are now no technical obstacles for decline to $ 0,1. The further decline is more likely.

As predicted in my last post  bitcoin -0.56%  has not been successful breaking the  support level  which has been standing since last year. The price of  bitcoin -0.56%  had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks. This would mainly depend on news as there has been a lot of negative news around cryptocurrencies. There is still a chance that the price may fall and test the  support level  once again but this could only be figured out over time. This is mainly due to the  RSI  being very close to oversold just as the price managed to get a little out of the  support zone .

I find the patterns here on the last two rallys eerily similar.  Two bumps against the top of the flag, then only a partial retrace down to the red box before it reaches the top for a 3rd time.  Then a bounce off the bottom and back and forth before another rally up.  

What do you think of that?  My initial 3rd wave projection appears to be off, and if the 4th wave drops any further, it will invalidate my EW count... but even though the wicks of the 4th wave and 1st wave overlap just a smidge, I'm keeping my count where it for now.  Another bounce off the bottom of the  bull flag  could trigger the 5th wave up to 6800-7000.

As predicted in my last post  bitcoin              has not been successful breaking the  support level  which has been standing since last year. The price of  bitcoin              had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks. This would mainly depend on news as there has been a lot of negative news around cryptocurrencies. There is still a chance that the price may fall and test the  support level  once again but this could only be figured out over time. This is mainly due to the  RSI  being very close to oversold just as the price managed to get a little out of the  support zone .

I find the patterns here on the last two rallys eerily similar.  Two bumps against the top of the flag, then only a partial retrace down to the red box before it reaches the top for a 3rd time.  Then a bounce off the bottom and back and forth before another rally up.  

What do you think of that?  My initial 3rd wave projection appears to be off, and if the 4th wave drops any further, it will invalidate my EW count... but even though the wicks of the 4th wave and 1st wave overlap just a smidge, I'm keeping my count where it for now.

Some resistance on the .236 fib. If we can break above here then the path to 7000-7100 will be clear.   MACD  has plenty of room to run after a  bullish  cross.   RSI  trending upwards, but has some room for regression.   

If we see a continuation, then we have 8000 lying conveniently on the golden fibonacci of .618.

Last week major cryptocurrencies changed in price a little, achieving new local minimums during the week.  Bitcoin -0.56%  achieved its minimum of $ 5’780 and by the close of the week managed to rise above key level of $ 6’000. Its share in total capitalization increased to 42,5%. 
The number of billionaire-coins is still 18 and their total number (according to https://coinmarketcap.com) has increased to 1’597. 
The total capitalization of cryptocurrencies grew to $ 256 billion. 

Bitcoin -0.56%  increased by 3% from $ 6’150 to $ 6’350 last week, the minimum was $ 5’780. 






The market has sagged to key level of $ 6’000 and has been consolidating near it. There has not been close of day and week under $ 6’000 yet. However, it is almost inevitable without active purchases. 
Until $ 9’000 is overcome, long-term technical picture remains  bearish . 

Ethereum -1.95%  decreased by further 0,6% from $ 455 to $ 452, the minimum was $ 405. 






Ethtereum made a new minimum in the beginning of the week. However, it ended the week at the initial rate. Medium-term downward trend has continued. The zone of long-term support is from $ 360 and lower. The rise above $ 800 will be a signal of growth resumption. 

Ripple (XRPUSD) decreased by further 4% from $ 0,48 to $ 0,46 with the minimum of $ 0,415. 






The decline has continued. New local minimum was reached. Testing of April minimum of around $ 0,45 has been going on. Its break will open the way to $ 0,2 - $ 0,25. The further decline is more likely. 

BCHUSD              decreased by further 1,2% from $ 747 to $ 738, the minimum was $ 646. 






The rate slowed down its incremental decline. However, there are no signs of turnaround and going up. The support is on $ 600 and $ 300. The resistance is $ 1’100 and then $ 1’800. The further decline is more likely. 

Litecoin fell by further 0,3% from $ 80,5 to $ 80,2, the minimum was $ 72. 






The key support near $ 100 is broken. There are no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 55 now. 

IOTA grew by 9% from $ 0,98 to $ 1,07 with the minimum of $ 0,89. 






IOTA did not manage to overcome the reached first decline target near $ 1 promptly. There was a rebound within very modest correction. The further gradual decrease to $ 0,33 is more likely.

1530632819.0,icexch,Weekly review of 10 major cryptocurrencies 24.06.18 - 01.07.18,"
Last week major cryptocurrencies changed in price a little, achieving new local minimums during the week.  Bitcoin -0.56%  achieved its minimum of $ 5’780 and by the close of the week managed to rise above key level of $ 6’000. Its share in total capitalization increased to 42,5%. 
The number of billionaire-coins is still 18 and their total number (according to https://coinmarketcap.com) has increased to 1’597. 
The total capitalization of cryptocurrencies grew to $ 256 billion. 

Bitcoin -0.56%  increased by 3% from $ 6’150 to $ 6’350 last week, the minimum was $ 5’780. 






The market has sagged to key level of $ 6’000 and has been consolidating near it. There has not been close of day and week under $ 6’000 yet. However, it is almost inevitable without active purchases. 
Until $ 9’000 is overcome, long-term technical picture remains  bearish . 

Ethereum -1.95%  decreased by further 0,6% from $ 455 to $ 452, the minimum was $ 405. 






Ethtereum made a new minimum in the beginning of the week. However, it ended the week at the initial rate. Medium-term downward trend has continued. The zone of long-term support is from $ 360 and lower. The rise above $ 800 will be a signal of growth resumption. 

Ripple (XRPUSD) decreased by further 4% from $ 0,48 to $ 0,46 with the minimum of $ 0,415. 






The decline has continued. New local minimum was reached. Testing of April minimum of around $ 0,45 has been going on. Its break will open the way to $ 0,2 - $ 0,25. The further decline is more likely. 

BCHUSD -1.55%  decreased by further 1,2% from $ 747 to $ 738, the minimum was $ 646. 






The rate slowed down its incremental decline. However, there are no signs of turnaround and going up. The support is on $ 600 and $ 300. The resistance is $ 1’100 and then $ 1’800. The further decline is more likely. 

Litecoin fell by further 0,3% from $ 80,5 to $ 80,2, the minimum was $ 72. 






The key support near $ 100 is broken. There are no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 55 now. 

IOTA grew by 9% from $ 0,98 to $ 1,07 with the minimum of $ 0,89. 






IOTA did not manage to overcome the reached first decline target near $ 1 promptly. There was a rebound within very modest correction. The further gradual decrease to $ 0,33 is more likely. 

NEO is near $ 31 as it was with the minimum of $ 27. 






The support near $ 45 was broken. There are now no technical obstacles for the decline to $ 22. The further decline is more likely. 

Monero grew a bit by 7,5% from $ 121 to $ 130, the minimum was $ 114. 






The support above $ 150 was broken. And the decline continued. But the new minimum was not reached. Probably the appeared purchases rebalanced market. 
This week the consolidation on reached levels is more likely. 

DASH declined by further 1% from $ 238 to $ 236, the minimum was $ 210. 






The fall reached the support near $ 220. 
However, it is more likely to just stopped its decrease for a while. The further decline is more likely. 

NEM              went up by 10% from $ 0,15 to $ 0,166 with the minimum of $ 0,14. 






Important support in $ 0,20 was broken. 
There are now no technical obstacles for decline to $ 0,1. The further decline is more likely.

As predicted in my last post  bitcoin -0.56%  has not been successful breaking the  support level  which has been standing since last year. The price of  bitcoin -0.56%  had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks. This would mainly depend on news as there has been a lot of negative news around cryptocurrencies. There is still a chance that the price may fall and test the  support level  once again but this could only be figured out over time. This is mainly due to the  RSI  being very close to oversold just as the price managed to get a little out of the  support zone .

I find the patterns here on the last two rallys eerily similar.  Two bumps against the top of the flag, then only a partial retrace down to the red box before it reaches the top for a 3rd time.  Then a bounce off the bottom and back and forth before another rally up.  

What do you think of that?  My initial 3rd wave projection appears to be off, and if the 4th wave drops any further, it will invalidate my EW count... but even though the wicks of the 4th wave and 1st wave overlap just a smidge, I'm keeping my count where it for now.  Another bounce off the bottom of the  bull flag  could trigger the 5th wave up to 6800-7000.

					Here is the chart when I first spotted the Rising Wedge

1530631012.0,JohnnyPurtoy98,BTCUSD - Back up we go!,"
As predicted in my last post  bitcoin -0.64%  has not been successful breaking the  support level  which has been standing since last year. The price of  bitcoin -0.64%  had managed to bounce and looks like now it is on its way up, the way the price has rejected the support may suggest we see further rises in this pair over the coming weeks. This would mainly depend on news as there has been a lot of negative news around cryptocurrencies. There is still a chance that the price may fall and test the  support level  once again but this could only be figured out over time. This is mainly due to the  RSI  being very close to oversold just as the price managed to get a little out of the  support zone .

Quick analysis of  BTC -0.64%  on the 4hour Chart 

Looking to break overhead resistance (in red) 
The  bullish  scenario would be for  BTC -0.64%  to hold its gains and for a  flag pattern  to form at its current level. If followed by strong  volume  coming in, we may see  BTC -0.64%  looking to retest 8000. 

Hold on to your horses!!

I wanted to plot the correlation between the Crypto Fear and Greed Index and the the  BTC              price.  The index is found here- 
https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/ 

Selling above 60 on the index and buying below 15 would have been good exits and entries this year.  I don't know if anyone else will find my charts useful, I usually just publish ideas I want to go back to and refer to later.
