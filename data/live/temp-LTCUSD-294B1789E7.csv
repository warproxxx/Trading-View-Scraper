1531036861.0,VARZAR_INVESTMENT,Trading plan: LTCUSD (Litecoin),"
The rate of Litecoin rose sharply above the $ 83 level. 
Priority of the day:  LTCUSD -1.44%  rate increase to $ 88. 
Sellers could not lower the price of Litecoin, and the fight was won by buyers. The potential for growth in the price of Litecoin is small, because there has not yet been a good movement downwards for the market reversal.  
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  LTCUSD -1.44%  rate will rise from $ 83 to $ 88. 
2. The  LTCUSD -1.44%  rate may be in flat all day. 
Alternative scenario: 
Too many rollbacks to the momentum of the rise in the price of Litecoin - the first sign of the weakness of buyers. Therefore, at any time we expect the fall of Litecoin to $ 76. Today this plan is unlikely to happen, but it is still possible.
