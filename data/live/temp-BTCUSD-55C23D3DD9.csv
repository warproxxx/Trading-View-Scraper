The next 24-48 hours could be decisive for the next  BTC -1.36%  move. 
BTC -1.36%  has been slowly grinding sideways at support on a  descending triangle , the past few days. 
Descending triangles tend to have a  bearish  bias and we could see a break below support. 

A break of the descending  trendline  may lead to a nice bounce play but right now we're on the fence. 

On the Bull side, Support could hold up, and we could see a bounce from here.

On the  Daily Chart  it looks like the next Bearflag is forming. Possible that we will se 6300 Dollar and then leave the flag bottom. Second Scenario is that this is really the bottom, and we can grow from there. But i think we need to go down and come back with a big pullback to get the 6300 and then 6800.  

For this Bulltrap the Range would bring us to 5804 Dollar.

Idea entirely based off of the  fractal  above. 
Extreme similarities between the two. 

Based on the  fractal  my ideal entry should be just above $6000. This is just as long as support holds.  
Final Target would be the 1.272 fib level. 

Fractal  becomes invalid if we were to make a lower low.

Approximate flat limits 6000-6360. In the previous idea, I thought that coming out of the first fleet we will purposefully start the movement down. But no. We have purposefully come to the second fleet. Therefore, I decided to combine this consolidation in order not to make sharp movements when one of the flutes breaks.

There are two ways to get to 5500:

Look at the previous bear flags. Dramatic fall after the break out of channel, with the exception of the most recent one.

Look at the previous bear flags. Dramatic fall after the break out of channel, with the exception of the most recent one. Speculating here, like I said a breakout is coming in one direction or the other so trying to find anything to help. Parabolic extension support around 5100-5500 incase this doesn't play out.

The next 24-48 hours could be decisive for the next  BTC -1.37%  move. 
BTC -1.37%  has been slowly grinding sideways at support on a  descending triangle , the past few days. 
Descending triangles tend to have a  bearish  bias and we could see a break below support. 

A break of the descending  trendline  may lead to a nice bounce play but right now we're on the fence. 

On the Bull side, Support could hold up, and we could see a bounce from here.

On the  Daily Chart  it looks like the next Bearflag is forming. Possible that we will se 6300 Dollar and then leave the flag bottom. Second Scenario is that this is really the bottom, and we can grow from there. But i think we need to go down and come back with a big pullback to get the 6300 and then 6800.

Idea entirely based off of the  fractal  above. 
Extreme similarities between the two. 

Based on the  fractal  my ideal entry should be just above $6000. This is just as long as support holds.  
Final Target would be the 1.272 fib level. 

Fractal  becomes invalid if we were to make a lower low.

I update the idea of fairy-tale flat, which, hopefully, will end by the end of the month. 
Approximate flat limits 6000-6360. In the previous idea, I thought that coming out of the first fleet we will purposefully start the movement down. But no. We have purposefully come to the second fleet. Therefore, I decided to combine this consolidation in order not to make sharp movements when one of the flutes breaks. In the future, I expect to drop to 5500. 
There are two ways to get to 5500: 
1. Break the flat down now 
2. go to the top of the flat and maybe even test the  trend line  (6460$), then go for 5500

Look at the previous bear flags. Dramatic fall after the break out of channel, with the exception of the most recent one. Speculating here, like I said a breakout is coming in one direction or the other so trying to find anything to help. Parabolic extension support around 5100-5500 incase this doesn't play out.

Descending triangles tend to have a  bearish  bias and we could see a break below support.

On the  Daily Chart  it looks like the next Bearflag is forming. Possible that we will se 6300 Dollar and then leave the flag bottom. Second Scenario is that this is really the bottom, and we can grow from there. But i think we need to go down and come back with a big pullback to get the 6300 and then 6800.

Extreme similarities between the two. 

Based on the  fractal  my ideal entry should be just above $6000. This is just as long as support holds.  
Final Target would be the 1.272 fib level. 

Fractal  becomes invalid if we were to make a lower low.

Look at the previous bear flags. Dramatic fall after the break out of channel, with the exception of the most recent one. Speculating here, like I said a breakout is coming in one direction or the other so trying to find anything to help. Parabolic extension support around 5100-5500 incase this doesn't play out.

The next 24-48 hours could be decisive for the next  BTC              move. 
BTC              has been slowly grinding sideways at support on a  descending triangle , the past few days. 
Descending triangles tend to have a  bearish  bias and we could see a break below support. 

A break of the descending  trendline  may lead to a nice bounce play but right now we're on the fence. 

On the Bull side, Support could hold up, and we could see a bounce from here.

On the  Daily Chart  it looks like the next Bearflag is forming. Possible that we will se 6300 Dollar and then leave the flag bottom. Second Scenario is that this is really the bottom, and we can grow from there. But i think we need to go down and come back with a big pullback to get the 6300 and then 6800.  

For this Bulltrap the Range would bring us to 5804 Dollar.

Idea entirely based off of the  fractal  above. 
Extreme similarities between the two. 

Based on the  fractal  my ideal entry should be just above $6000. This is just as long as support holds.  
Final Target would be the 1.272 fib level. 

Fractal  becomes invalid if we were to make a lower low.

Approximate flat limits 6000-6360. In the previous idea, I thought that coming out of the first fleet we will purposefully start the movement down. But no. We have purposefully come to the second fleet. Therefore, I decided to combine this consolidation in order not to make sharp movements when one of the flutes breaks. In the future, I expect to drop to 5500. 
There are two ways to get to 5500: 
1. Break the flat down now

I update the idea of fairy-tale flat, which, hopefully, will end by the end of the month. 
Approximate flat limits 6000-6360. In the previous idea, I thought that coming out of the first fleet we will purposefully start the movement down. But no. We have purposefully come to the second fleet. Therefore, I decided to combine this consolidation in order not to make sharp movements when one of the flutes breaks. In the future, I expect to drop to 5500. 
There are two ways to get to 5500: 
1. Break the flat down now 
2. go to the top of the flat and maybe even test the  trend line  (6460$), then go for 5500

Look at the previous bear flags. Dramatic fall after the break out of channel, with the exception of the most recent one. Speculating here, like I said a breakout is coming in one direction or the other so trying to find anything to help. Parabolic extension support around 5100-5500 incase this doesn't play out.

Idea entirely based off of the  fractal  above. 
Extreme similarities between the two. 

Based on the  fractal  my ideal entry should be just above $6000. This is just as long as support holds.  
Final Target would be the 1.272 fib level. 

Fractal  becomes invalid if we were to make a lower low.

Based on the  fractal  my ideal entry should be just above $6000. This is just as long as support holds.

Approximate flat limits 6000-6360. In the previous idea, I thought that coming out of the first fleet we will purposefully start the movement down. But no. We have purposefully come to the second fleet. Therefore, I decided to combine this consolidation in order not to make sharp movements when one of the flutes breaks. In the future, I expect to drop to 5500. 
There are two ways to get to 5500: 
1. Break the flat down now

Look at the previous bear flags. Dramatic fall after the break out of channel, with the exception of the most recent one. Speculating here, like I said a breakout is coming in one direction or the other so trying to find anything to help. Parabolic extension support around 5100-5500 incase this doesn't play out.

Look at the previous bear flags. Dramatic fall after the break out of channel, with the exception of the most recent one. Speculating here, like I said a breakout is coming in one direction or the other so trying to find anything to help. Parabolic extension support around 5100-5500 incase this doesn't play out.

The next 24-48 hours could be decisive for the next  BTC -2.38%  move. 
BTC -2.38%  has been slowly grinding sideways at support on a  descending triangle , the past few days. 
Descending triangles tend to have a  bearish  bias and we could see a break below support. 

A break of the descending  trendline  may lead to a nice bounce play but right now we're on the fence. 

On the Bull side, Support could hold up, and we could see a bounce from here.

On the  Daily Chart  it looks like the next Bearflag is forming. Possible that we will se 6300 Dollar and then leave the flag bottom. Second Scenario is that this is really the bottom, and we can grow from there. But i think we need to go down and come back with a big pullback to get the 6300 and then 6800.

Idea entirely based off of the  fractal  above. 
Extreme similarities between the two. 

Based on the  fractal  my ideal entry should be just above $6000. This is just as long as support holds.  
Final Target would be the 1.272 fib level. 

Fractal  becomes invalid if we were to make a lower low.

I update the idea of fairy-tale flat, which, hopefully, will end by the end of the month. 
Approximate flat limits 6000-6360. In the previous idea, I thought that coming out of the first fleet we will purposefully start the movement down. But no. We have purposefully come to the second fleet. Therefore, I decided to combine this consolidation in order not to make sharp movements when one of the flutes breaks. In the future, I expect to drop to 5500. 
There are two ways to get to 5500: 
1. Break the flat down now 
2. go to the top of the flat and maybe even test the  trend line  (6460$), then go for 5500

Look at the previous bear flags. Dramatic fall after the break out of channel, with the exception of the most recent one. Speculating here, like I said a breakout is coming in one direction or the other so trying to find anything to help. Parabolic extension support around 5100-5500 incase this doesn't play out.

On the  Daily Chart  it looks like the next Bearflag is forming. Possible that we will se 6300 Dollar and then leave the flag bottom. Second Scenario is that this is really the bottom, and we can grow from there. But i think we need to go down and come back with a big pullback to get the 6300 and then 6800.

Idea entirely based off of the  fractal  above. 
Extreme similarities between the two. 

Based on the  fractal  my ideal entry should be just above $6000. This is just as long as support holds.  
Final Target would be the 1.272 fib level. 

Fractal  becomes invalid if we were to make a lower low. 

Wish you all the best of luck!

On the  Daily Chart  it looks like the next Bearflag is forming. Possible that we will se 6300 Dollar and then leave the flag bottom. Second Scenario is that this is really the bottom, and we can grow from there. But i think we need to go down and come back with a big pullback to get the 6300 and then 6800.  

For this Bulltrap the Range would bring us to 5804 Dollar.

Based on the  fractal  my ideal entry should be just above $6000. This is just as long as support holds.

Look at the previous bear flags. Dramatic fall after the break out of channel, with the exception of the most recent one. Speculating here, like I said a breakout is coming in one direction or the other so trying to find anything to help. Parabolic extension support around 5100-5500 incase this doesn't play out.

On the  Daily Chart  it looks like the next Bearflag is forming. Possible that we will se 6300 Dollar and then leave the flag bottom. Second Scenario is that this is really the bottom, and we can grow from there. But i think we need to go down and come back with a big pullback to get the 6300 and then 6800.

Idea entirely based off of the  fractal  above. 
Extreme similarities between the two. 

Based on the  fractal  my ideal entry should be just above $6000. This is just as long as support holds.  
Final Target would be the 1.272 fib level. 

Fractal  becomes invalid if we were to make a lower low.

I update the idea of fairy-tale flat, which, hopefully, will end by the end of the month. 
Approximate flat limits 6000-6360. In the previous idea, I thought that coming out of the first fleet we will purposefully start the movement down. But no. We have purposefully come to the second fleet. Therefore, I decided to combine this consolidation in order not to make sharp movements when one of the flutes breaks. In the future, I expect to drop to 5500. 
There are two ways to get to 5500: 
1. Break the flat down now 
2. go to the top of the flat and maybe even test the  trend line  (6460$), then go for 5500

Look at the previous bear flags. Dramatic fall after the break out of channel, with the exception of the most recent one. Speculating here, like I said a breakout is coming in one direction or the other so trying to find anything to help. Parabolic extension support around 5100-5500 incase this doesn't play out.

The next 24-48 hours could be decisive for the next  BTC -2.36%  move. 
BTC -2.36%  has been slowly grinding sideways at support on a  descending triangle , the past few days. 
Descending triangles tend to have a  bearish  bias and we could see a break below support.

On the  Daily Chart  it looks like the next Bearflag is forming. Possible that we will se 6300 Dollar and then leave the flag bottom. Second Scenario is that this is really the bottom, and we can grow from there. But i think we need to go down and come back with a big pullback to get the 6300 and then 6800.

Extreme similarities between the two. 

Based on the  fractal  my ideal entry should be just above $6000. This is just as long as support holds.  
Final Target would be the 1.272 fib level. 

Fractal  becomes invalid if we were to make a lower low.

Look at the previous bear flags. Dramatic fall after the break out of channel, with the exception of the most recent one. Speculating here, like I said a breakout is coming in one direction or the other so trying to find anything to help. Parabolic extension support around 5100-5500 incase this doesn't play out.

The next 24-48 hours could be decisive for the next  BTC -2.27%  move. 
BTC -2.27%  has been slowly grinding sideways at support on a  descending triangle , the past few days. 
Descending triangles tend to have a  bearish  bias and we could see a break below support. 

A break of the descending  trendline  may lead to a nice bounce play but right now we're on the fence. 

On the Bull side, Support could hold up, and we could see a bounce from here.

On the  Daily Chart  it looks like the next Bearflag is forming. Possible that we will se 6300 Dollar and then leave the flag bottom. Second Scenario is that this is really the bottom, and we can grow from there. But i think we need to go down and come back with a big pullback to get the 6300 and then 6800.  

For this Bulltrap the Range would bring us to 5804 Dollar.

Idea entirely based off of the  fractal  above. 
Extreme similarities between the two. 

Based on the  fractal  my ideal entry should be just above $6000. This is just as long as support holds.  
Final Target would be the 1.272 fib level. 

Fractal  becomes invalid if we were to make a lower low.

Approximate flat limits 6000-6360. In the previous idea, I thought that coming out of the first fleet we will purposefully start the movement down. But no. We have purposefully come to the second fleet. Therefore, I decided to combine this consolidation in order not to make sharp movements when one of the flutes breaks.

I update the idea of fairy-tale flat, which, hopefully, will end by the end of the month. 
Approximate flat limits 6000-6360. In the previous idea, I thought that coming out of the first fleet we will purposefully start the movement down. But no. We have purposefully come to the second fleet. Therefore, I decided to combine this consolidation in order not to make sharp movements when one of the flutes breaks. In the future, I expect to drop to 5500. 
There are two ways to get to 5500: 
1. Break the flat down now 
2. go to the top of the flat and maybe even test the  trend line  (6460$), then go for 5500

Look at the previous bear flags. Dramatic fall after the break out of channel, with the exception of the most recent one. Speculating here, like I said a breakout is coming in one direction or the other so trying to find anything to help. Parabolic extension support around 5100-5500 incase this doesn't play out.

Idea entirely based off of the  fractal  above. 
Extreme similarities between the two. 

Based on the  fractal  my ideal entry should be just above $6000. This is just as long as support holds.  
Final Target would be the 1.272 fib level. 

Fractal  becomes invalid if we were to make a lower low.

Approximate flat limits 6000-6360. In the previous idea, I thought that coming out of the first fleet we will purposefully start the movement down. But no. We have purposefully come to the second fleet. Therefore, I decided to combine this consolidation in order not to make sharp movements when one of the flutes breaks. In the future, I expect to drop to 5500. 
There are two ways to get to 5500: 
1. Break the flat down now 
2. go to the top of the flat and maybe even test the  trend line  (6460$), then go for 5500

Look at the previous bear flags. Dramatic fall after the break out of channel, with the exception of the most recent one. Speculating here, like I said a breakout is coming in one direction or the other so trying to find anything to help. Parabolic extension support around 5100-5500 incase this doesn't play out.

Look at the previous bear flags. Dramatic fall after the break out of channel, with the exception of the most recent one. Speculating here, like I said a breakout is coming in one direction or the other so trying to find anything to help. Parabolic extension support around 5100-5500 incase this doesn't play out.

The next 24-48 hours could be decisive for the next  BTC -2.24%  move. 
BTC -2.24%  has been slowly grinding sideways at support on a  descending triangle , the past few days. 
Descending triangles tend to have a  bearish  bias and we could see a break below support. 

A break of the descending  trendline  may lead to a nice bounce play but right now we're on the fence. 

On the Bull side, Support could hold up, and we could see a bounce from here.

On the  Daily Chart  it looks like the next Bearflag is forming. Possible that we will se 6300 Dollar and then leave the flag bottom. Second Scenario is that this is really the bottom, and we can grow from there. But i think we need to go down and come back with a big pullback to get the 6300 and then 6800.

Idea entirely based off of the  fractal  above. 
Extreme similarities between the two. 

Based on the  fractal  my ideal entry should be just above $6000. This is just as long as support holds.  
Final Target would be the 1.272 fib level. 

Fractal  becomes invalid if we were to make a lower low.

Approximate flat limits 6000-6360. In the previous idea, I thought that coming out of the first fleet we will purposefully start the movement down. But no. We have purposefully come to the second fleet. Therefore, I decided to combine this consolidation in order not to make sharp movements when one of the flutes breaks. In the future, I expect to drop to 5500. 
There are two ways to get to 5500:

Last wave (e) may truncate/overshoot, given the FOMO nature of the newborn  BTC -2.86%  market, I'm more biased to the later... 

higher possibility of an overshoot to form a Bull Trap,  triangle pattern  gives 7800-8000 as upside target...before continuing down to form a higher degree Wave C, of an  ABC  correctional structure from 20,000 peak. 

shall the 1st option fail to materialize, then a truncated wave (e) will take place instead, falling short of the 8,000 target. 

Will update again as the wave progresses.

This is where I think we are at the moment.

I update the idea of fairy-tale flat, which, hopefully, will end by the end of the month. 
Approximate flat limits 6000-6360. In the previous idea, I thought that coming out of the first fleet we will purposefully start the movement down. But no. We have purposefully come to the second fleet. Therefore, I decided to combine this consolidation in order not to make sharp movements when one of the flutes breaks. In the future, I expect to drop to 5500. 
There are two ways to get to 5500: 
1. Break the flat down now 
2. go to the top of the flat and maybe even test the  trend line  (6460$), then go for 5500

Look at the previous bear flags. Dramatic fall after the break out of channel, with the exception of the most recent one. Speculating here, like I said a breakout is coming in one direction or the other so trying to find anything to help. Parabolic extension support around 5100-5500 incase this doesn't play out.

The next 24-48 hours could be decisive for the next  BTC -2.96%  move. 
BTC -2.96%  has been slowly grinding sideways at support on a  descending triangle , the past few days. 
Descending triangles tend to have a  bearish  bias and we could see a break below support. 

A break of the descending  trendline  may lead to a nice bounce play but right now we're on the fence. 

On the Bull side, Support could hold up, and we could see a bounce from here.

On the  Daily Chart  it looks like the next Bearflag is forming. Possible that we will se 6300 Dollar and then leave the flag bottom. Second Scenario is that this is really the bottom, and we can grow from there. But i think we need to go down and come back with a big pullback to get the 6300 and then 6800.  

For this Bulltrap the Range would bring us to 5804 Dollar.

Idea entirely based off of the  fractal  above. 
Extreme similarities between the two. 

Based on the  fractal  my ideal entry should be just above $6000. This is just as long as support holds.  
Final Target would be the 1.272 fib level. 

Fractal  becomes invalid if we were to make a lower low. 

Wish you all the best of luck!
