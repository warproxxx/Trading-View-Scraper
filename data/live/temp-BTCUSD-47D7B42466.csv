 Btc -0.38%  broke the uptrend support , if next 4 hours candle doesn't close above the support then we are going to see a dip.  

Possible to head and shoulder formation here , with right shoulder being formed right now. If you go short here take profits at $6300 and get out of trade.

When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement of that  Rising Wedge  move, give ourselves a bit of breathing room on the lower time frame  RSI  and regain a bit of interest on the buy side and then continue our move up since the Daily  RSI  is still progressing slowly higher and nowhere near elevated levels 

I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations.

So to me this chart is a clear example of price manipulation. It looks like  BTC -0.46%  reversed from  bearish  to  bullish  across most market participants June 24th. Price has been making a slow  wedge  up except for the 29th when  CME futures  contracts expired. It was a perfect push down for the close of the trading day to close out short contracts that opened back in december. Then followed by a strong rally back up into the  wedge  by the end of the day. In my mind we will continue in this  wedge  until a breakout that will most likely be up. As long as we stay above 6500 for the next day or so i think we'll  continue this rally all the way back up to $10k in the mid term.

I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations.

So to me this chart is a clear example of price manipulation. It looks like  BTC -0.43%  reversed from  bearish  to  bullish  across most market participants June 24th. Price has been making a slow  wedge  up except for the 29th when  CME futures  contracts expired. It was a perfect push down for the close of the trading day to close out short contracts that opened back in december. Then followed by a strong rally back up into the  wedge  by the end of the day. In my mind we will continue in this  wedge  until a breakout that will most likely be up. As long as we stay above 6500 for the next day or so i think we'll  continue this rally all the way back up to $10k in the mid term.

So to me this chart is a clear example of price manipulation. It looks like  BTC -0.50%  reversed from  bearish  to  bullish  across most market participants June 24th. Price has been making a slow  wedge  up except for the 29th when  CME futures  contracts expired. It was a perfect push down for the close of the trading day to close out short contracts that opened back in december. Then followed by a strong rally back up into the  wedge  by the end of the day. In my mind we will continue in this  wedge  until a breakout that will most likely be up. As long as we stay above 6500 for the next day or so i think we'll  continue this rally all the way back up to $10k in the mid term.

When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement of that  Rising Wedge  move, give ourselves a bit of breathing room on the lower time frame  RSI  and regain a bit of interest on the buy side and then continue our move up since the Daily  RSI  is still progressing slowly higher and nowhere near elevated levels 

I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations.

I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations.

So to me this chart is a clear example of price manipulation. It looks like  BTC -0.15%  reversed from  bearish  to  bullish  across most market participants June 24th. Price has been making a slow  wedge  up except for the 29th when  CME futures  contracts expired. It was a perfect push down for the close of the trading day to close out short contracts that opened back in december. Then followed by a strong rally back up into the  wedge  by the end of the day. In my mind we will continue in this  wedge  until a breakout that will most likely be up. As long as we stay above 6500 for the next day or so i think we'll  continue this rally all the way back up to $10k in the mid term.

When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement of that  Rising Wedge  move, give ourselves a bit of breathing room on the lower time frame  RSI  and regain a bit of interest on the buy side and then continue our move up since the Daily  RSI  is still progressing slowly higher and nowhere near elevated levels 

I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations.

So to me this chart is a clear example of price manipulation. It looks like  BTC -0.26%  reversed from  bearish  to  bullish  across most market participants June 24th. Price has been making a slow  wedge  up except for the 29th when  CME futures  contracts expired. It was a perfect push down for the close of the trading day to close out short contracts that opened back in december. Then followed by a strong rally back up into the  wedge  by the end of the day. In my mind we will continue in this  wedge  until a breakout that will most likely be up. As long as we stay above 6500 for the next day or so i think we'll  continue this rally all the way back up to $10k in the mid term.

So to me this chart is a clear example of price manipulation. It looks like  BTC -0.25%  reversed from  bearish  to  bullish  across most market participants June 24th. Price has been making a slow  wedge  up except for the 29th when  CME futures  contracts expired. It was a perfect push down for the close of the trading day to close out short contracts that opened back in december. Then followed by a strong rally back up into the  wedge  by the end of the day. In my mind we will continue in this  wedge  until a breakout that will most likely be up. As long as we stay above 6500 for the next day or so i think we'll  continue this rally all the way back up to $10k in the mid term.

So to me this chart is a clear example of price manipulation. It looks like  BTC -0.25%  reversed from  bearish  to  bullish  across most market participants June 24th. Price has been making a slow  wedge  up except for the 29th when  CME futures  contracts expired. It was a perfect push down for the close of the trading day to close out short contracts that opened back in december. Then followed by a strong rally back up into the  wedge  by the end of the day. In my mind we will continue in this  wedge  until a breakout that will most likely be up. As long as we stay above 6500 for the next day or so i think we'll  continue this rally all the way back up to $10k in the mid term.

When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement of that  Rising Wedge  move, give ourselves a bit of breathing room on the lower time frame  RSI  and regain a bit of interest on the buy side and then continue our move up since the Daily  RSI  is still progressing slowly higher and nowhere near elevated levels 

I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations.

So to me this chart is a clear example of price manipulation. It looks like  BTC -0.40%  reversed from  bearish  to  bullish  across most market participants June 24th. Price has been making a slow  wedge  up except for the 29th when  CME futures  contracts expired. It was a perfect push down for the close of the trading day to close out short contracts that opened back in december. Then followed by a strong rally back up into the  wedge  by the end of the day. In my mind we will continue in this  wedge  until a breakout that will most likely be up. As long as we stay above 6500 for the next day or so i think we'll  continue this rally all the way back up to $10k in the mid term.

When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement of that  Rising Wedge  move, give ourselves a bit of breathing room on the lower time frame  RSI  and regain a bit of interest on the buy side and then continue our move up since the Daily  RSI  is still progressing slowly higher and nowhere near elevated levels 

I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations.

So to me this chart is a clear example of price manipulation. It looks like  BTC              reversed from  bearish  to  bullish  across most market participants June 24th. Price has been making a slow  wedge  up except for the 29th when  CME futures  contracts expired. It was a perfect push down for the close of the trading day to close out short contracts that opened back in december. Then followed by a strong rally back up into the  wedge  by the end of the day. In my mind we will continue in this  wedge  until a breakout that will most likely be up. As long as we stay above 6500 for the next day or so i think we'll  continue this rally all the way back up to $10k in the mid term.

When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement of that  Rising Wedge  move, give ourselves a bit of breathing room on the lower time frame  RSI  and regain a bit of interest on the buy side and then continue our move up since the Daily  RSI  is still progressing slowly higher and nowhere near elevated levels 

I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations.

So to me this chart is a clear example of price manipulation. It looks like  BTC -0.44%  reversed from  bearish  to  bullish  across most market participants June 24th. Price has been making a slow  wedge  up except for the 29th when  CME futures  contracts expired. It was a perfect push down for the close of the trading day to close out short contracts that opened back in december. Then followed by a strong rally back up into the  wedge  by the end of the day. In my mind we will continue in this  wedge  until a breakout that will most likely be up. As long as we stay above 6500 for the next day or so i think we'll  continue this rally all the way back up to $10k in the mid term.

As long as we stay above 6500 for the next day or so i think we'll  continue this rally all the way back up to $10k in the mid term.

When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement of that  Rising Wedge  move, give ourselves a bit of breathing room on the lower time frame  RSI  and regain a bit of interest on the buy side and then continue our move up since the Daily  RSI  is still progressing slowly higher and nowhere near elevated levels 

I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations.

So to me this chart is a clear example of price manipulation. It looks like  BTC -0.49%  reversed from  bearish  to  bullish  across most market participants June 24th. Price has been making a slow  wedge  up except for the 29th when  CME futures  contracts expired. It was a perfect push down for the close of the trading day to close out short contracts that opened back in december. Then followed by a strong rally back up into the  wedge  by the end of the day.

So to me this chart is a clear example of price manipulation. It looks like  BTC -0.50%  reversed from  bearish  to  bullish  across most market participants June 24th. Price has been making a slow  wedge  up except for the 29th when  CME futures  contracts expired. It was a perfect push down for the close of the trading day to close out short contracts that opened back in december. Then followed by a strong rally back up into the  wedge  by the end of the day. In my mind we will continue in this  wedge  until a breakout that will most likely be up. As long as we stay above 6500 for the next day or so i think we'll  continue this rally all the way back up to $10k in the mid term.

When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement of that  Rising Wedge  move, give ourselves a bit of breathing room on the lower time frame  RSI  and regain a bit of interest on the buy side and then continue our move up since the Daily  RSI  is still progressing slowly higher and nowhere near elevated levels 

I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations.

When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement of that  Rising Wedge  move, give ourselves a bit of breathing room on the lower time frame  RSI  and regain a bit of interest on the buy side and then continue our move up since the Daily  RSI  is still progressing slowly higher and nowhere near elevated levels 

I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations.

So to me this chart is a clear example of price manipulation. It looks like  BTC -1.93%  reversed from  bearish  to  bullish  across most market participants June 24th. Price has been making a slow  wedge  up except for the 29th when  CME futures  contracts expired. It was a perfect push down for the close of the trading day to close out short contracts that opened back in december. Then followed by a strong rally back up into the  wedge  by the end of the day. In my mind we will continue in this  wedge  until a breakout that will most likely be up. As long as we stay above 6500 for the next day or so i think we'll  continue this rally all the way back up to $10k in the mid term.

When I look at  RSI  and  MACD  levels and progression on 1H, 4H and Daily and other things like the  Rising Wedge  and a few other things I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement of that  Rising Wedge  move, give ourselves a bit of breathing room on the lower time frame  RSI  and regain a bit of interest on the buy side and then continue our move up since the Daily  RSI  is still progressing slowly higher and nowhere near elevated levels 

I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper. As always we have to wait and see what the market makers have in store for us in these situations.

So to me this chart is a clear example of price manipulation. It looks like  BTC -1.69%  reversed from  bearish  to  bullish  across most market participants June 24th. Price has been making a slow  wedge  up except for the 29th when  CME futures  contracts expired. It was a perfect push down for the close of the trading day to close out short contracts that opened back in december. Then followed by a strong rally back up into the  wedge  by the end of the day. In my mind we will continue in this  wedge  until a breakout that will most likely be up. As long as we stay above 6500 for the next day or so i think we'll  continue this rally all the way back up to $10k in the mid term.

So to me this chart is a clear example of price manipulation. It looks like  BTC -1.65%  reversed from  bearish  to  bullish  across most market participants June 24th. Price has been making a slow  wedge  up except for the 29th when  CME futures  contracts expired. It was a perfect push down for the close of the trading day to close out short contracts that opened back in december. Then followed by a strong rally back up into the  wedge  by the end of the day. In my mind we will continue in this  wedge  until a breakout that will most likely be up. As long as we stay above 6500 for the next day or so i think we'll  continue this rally all the way back up to $10k in the mid term.
