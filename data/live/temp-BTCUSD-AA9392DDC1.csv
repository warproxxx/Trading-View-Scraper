The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y              (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context. We are looking at the ending of the corrective structure. For those who are interested in this formation, you can take a look at my analysis of  AROC              which I have put the link here. You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.39%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar -0.46% . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.39%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)? 

Elliott Waves  tells us that price moves before macro-economics actions. Maybe the news may tell us what I have just said soon. 

Good Luck!

However, in the chart we also find the situations that market didn't follow the mentioned rule. 







In the above case, if we carefully examine, we would see a pair of candle close below a  resistance zone  and make price go down. And price is still following rule of breakout and give confirmation as usual. 






There are a lot of S/R appear in trading market. So, we have to choose by our own which is the S/R zone to play in each situation depending on our own experiences. No situation is exactly the same with each other! In the same above situation, at the same  S/R level  that we identified and used before, prices move differently (at that points, mostly our stoploss is hunted)

1531055691.0,rzmb44,Looking for Rally to Top and Make a Lower Low Below $5700,"
It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin -0.41% . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin -0.41%  going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

1531055691.0,rzmb44,Looking for Rally to Top and Make a Lower Low Below $5700,"
It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin             . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin              going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

But the overall atmosphere of  Bitcoin -0.34%  has changed significantly over of the past. At the moment, the 7-month decline flag has been completely broken. That is a good sign.

The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y              (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context. We are looking at the ending of the corrective structure. For those who are interested in this formation, you can take a look at my analysis of  AROC              which I have put the link here. You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.35%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar -0.46% . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.35%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)? 

Elliott Waves  tells us that price moves before macro-economics actions. Maybe the news may tell us what I have just said soon. 

Good Luck!

Break  support/Resistance , give confirmation? 
- We usually trade base on S/R to find the entry point, exit or to predict the trend. 
- One of an effective and simple way in trading is to trade when price breakout from a  S/R level 
- However, to identify an area or a point of good S/R in trading is mostly based on trading style, knowledge and trading experiences from each individual. 
Today I would like to talk about Breakout in trading. When it is breakout, when it is failed breakout. 
Before talking about breakout, we need to identify price closes above a  S/R level  or below a  S/R level . Examine the below chart: 







However, in the chart we also find the situations that market didn't follow the mentioned rule. 







In the above case, if we carefully examine, we would see a pair of candle close below a  resistance zone  and make price go down. And price is still following rule of breakout and give confirmation as usual. 






There are a lot of S/R appear in trading market. So, we have to choose by our own which is the S/R zone to play in each situation depending on our own experiences. No situation is exactly the same with each other! In the same above situation, at the same  S/R level  that we identified and used before, prices move differently (at that points, mostly our stoploss is hunted) 












Here, experienced traders would easily recognize failed breakout based on trend analysis, or the way prices breaks, or at least don't follow the breakout. 
We can analyze in a simple way as follow: 






And then price continues its trend 






I have presented some simple cases of successful breakout, failed breakout or fake breakout in the above chart. 
I would like to receive the contributions from the community to learn from each other. Noone is right or wrong all the time. Every wrong or right cases have its own price. Hope that people would not keep silence instread of telling what you know or learned. Nothing has its own value unless it spent some prices. I hope that people would give a way their knowledge, don't try to hide for your own if not we are all failed to this market.

In this post I'll suggest the next pump by the timeframe of the  bearish  opposite. In the exact same duration of 3D & 8H we would squeeze to the major Bull uprtrend support. Thats the point where I think the price action will happen. T1 would  be 7149. Fingers crossed.

The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y 0.66%  (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context. We are looking at the ending of the corrective structure. For those who are interested in this formation, you can take a look at my analysis of  AROC -0.79%  which I have put the link here. You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.32%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar -0.46% . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.32%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)? 

Elliott Waves  tells us that price moves before macro-economics actions. Maybe the news may tell us what I have just said soon.

However, in the chart we also find the situations that market didn't follow the mentioned rule. 







In the above case, if we carefully examine, we would see a pair of candle close below a  resistance zone  and make price go down. And price is still following rule of breakout and give confirmation as usual. 






There are a lot of S/R appear in trading market. So, we have to choose by our own which is the S/R zone to play in each situation depending on our own experiences. No situation is exactly the same with each other! In the same above situation, at the same  S/R level  that we identified and used before, prices move differently (at that points, mostly our stoploss is hunted)

1531055691.0,rzmb44,Looking for Rally to Top and Make a Lower Low Below $5700,"
It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin -0.32% . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin -0.32%  going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin -0.30% . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin -0.30%  going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y              (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context. We are looking at the ending of the corrective structure. For those who are interested in this formation, you can take a look at my analysis of  AROC -0.79%  which I have put the link here. You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.30%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar -0.46% . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.30%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)? 

Elliott Waves  tells us that price moves before macro-economics actions. Maybe the news may tell us what I have just said soon. 

Good Luck!

Break  support/Resistance , give confirmation? 
- We usually trade base on S/R to find the entry point, exit or to predict the trend. 
- One of an effective and simple way in trading is to trade when price breakout from a  S/R level 
- However, to identify an area or a point of good S/R in trading is mostly based on trading style, knowledge and trading experiences from each individual. 
Today I would like to talk about Breakout in trading. When it is breakout, when it is failed breakout. 
Before talking about breakout, we need to identify price closes above a  S/R level  or below a  S/R level . Examine the below chart: 







However, in the chart we also find the situations that market didn't follow the mentioned rule. 







In the above case, if we carefully examine, we would see a pair of candle close below a  resistance zone  and make price go down. And price is still following rule of breakout and give confirmation as usual. 






There are a lot of S/R appear in trading market. So, we have to choose by our own which is the S/R zone to play in each situation depending on our own experiences. No situation is exactly the same with each other! In the same above situation, at the same  S/R level  that we identified and used before, prices move differently (at that points, mostly our stoploss is hunted) 












Here, experienced traders would easily recognize failed breakout based on trend analysis, or the way prices breaks, or at least don't follow the breakout. 
We can analyze in a simple way as follow: 






And then price continues its trend 






I have presented some simple cases of successful breakout, failed breakout or fake breakout in the above chart. 
I would like to receive the contributions from the community to learn from each other. Noone is right or wrong all the time. Every wrong or right cases have its own price. Hope that people would not keep silence instread of telling what you know or learned. Nothing has its own value unless it spent some prices. I hope that people would give a way their knowledge, don't try to hide for your own if not we are all failed to this market.

The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y              (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context. We are looking at the ending of the corrective structure. For those who are interested in this formation, you can take a look at my analysis of  AROC              which I have put the link here. You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.30%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar -0.46% . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.30%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)? 

Elliott Waves  tells us that price moves before macro-economics actions. Maybe the news may tell us what I have just said soon. 

Good Luck!

- We usually trade base on S/R to find the entry point, exit or to predict the trend. 
- One of an effective and simple way in trading is to trade when price breakout from a  S/R level 
- However, to identify an area or a point of good S/R in trading is mostly based on trading style, knowledge and trading experiences from each individual.

However, in the chart we also find the situations that market didn't follow the mentioned rule. 







In the above case, if we carefully examine, we would see a pair of candle close below a  resistance zone  and make price go down. And price is still following rule of breakout and give confirmation as usual. 






There are a lot of S/R appear in trading market. So, we have to choose by our own which is the S/R zone to play in each situation depending on our own experiences. No situation is exactly the same with each other! In the same above situation, at the same  S/R level  that we identified and used before, prices move differently (at that points, mostly our stoploss is hunted) 












Here, experienced traders would easily recognize failed breakout based on trend analysis, or the way prices breaks, or at least don't follow the breakout.

1531055691.0,rzmb44,Looking for Rally to Top and Make a Lower Low Below $5700,"
It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin -0.30% . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin -0.30%  going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin -0.31% . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin -0.31%  going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y              (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context. We are looking at the ending of the corrective structure. For those who are interested in this formation, you can take a look at my analysis of  AROC              which I have put the link here. You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.30%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar -0.46% . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.30%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)? 

Elliott Waves  tells us that price moves before macro-economics actions. Maybe the news may tell us what I have just said soon. 

Good Luck!

Break  support/Resistance , give confirmation? 
- We usually trade base on S/R to find the entry point, exit or to predict the trend. 
- One of an effective and simple way in trading is to trade when price breakout from a  S/R level 
- However, to identify an area or a point of good S/R in trading is mostly based on trading style, knowledge and trading experiences from each individual. 
Today I would like to talk about Breakout in trading. When it is breakout, when it is failed breakout. 
Before talking about breakout, we need to identify price closes above a  S/R level  or below a  S/R level . Examine the below chart: 







However, in the chart we also find the situations that market didn't follow the mentioned rule. 







In the above case, if we carefully examine, we would see a pair of candle close below a  resistance zone  and make price go down. And price is still following rule of breakout and give confirmation as usual. 






There are a lot of S/R appear in trading market. So, we have to choose by our own which is the S/R zone to play in each situation depending on our own experiences. No situation is exactly the same with each other! In the same above situation, at the same  S/R level  that we identified and used before, prices move differently (at that points, mostly our stoploss is hunted) 












Here, experienced traders would easily recognize failed breakout based on trend analysis, or the way prices breaks, or at least don't follow the breakout. 
We can analyze in a simple way as follow: 






And then price continues its trend 






I have presented some simple cases of successful breakout, failed breakout or fake breakout in the above chart. 
I would like to receive the contributions from the community to learn from each other. Noone is right or wrong all the time. Every wrong or right cases have its own price. Hope that people would not keep silence instread of telling what you know or learned. Nothing has its own value unless it spent some prices. I hope that people would give a way their knowledge, don't try to hide for your own if not we are all failed to this market.

The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y              (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context. We are looking at the ending of the corrective structure. For those who are interested in this formation, you can take a look at my analysis of  AROC              which I have put the link here. You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.36%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar -0.46% . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.36%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)? 

Elliott Waves  tells us that price moves before macro-economics actions. Maybe the news may tell us what I have just said soon.

However, in the chart we also find the situations that market didn't follow the mentioned rule. 







In the above case, if we carefully examine, we would see a pair of candle close below a  resistance zone  and make price go down. And price is still following rule of breakout and give confirmation as usual. 






There are a lot of S/R appear in trading market. So, we have to choose by our own which is the S/R zone to play in each situation depending on our own experiences. No situation is exactly the same with each other! In the same above situation, at the same  S/R level  that we identified and used before, prices move differently (at that points, mostly our stoploss is hunted)

1531055691.0,rzmb44,Looking for Rally to Top and Make a Lower Low Below $5700,"
It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin -0.37% . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin -0.37%  going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin -0.41% . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin -0.41%  going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y 0.66%  (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context. We are looking at the ending of the corrective structure. For those who are interested in this formation, you can take a look at my analysis of  AROC -0.79%  which I have put the link here. You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.34%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar             . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.34%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)? 

Elliott Waves  tells us that price moves before macro-economics actions. Maybe the news may tell us what I have just said soon. 

Good Luck!

Break  support/Resistance , give confirmation? 
- We usually trade base on S/R to find the entry point, exit or to predict the trend. 
- One of an effective and simple way in trading is to trade when price breakout from a  S/R level 
- However, to identify an area or a point of good S/R in trading is mostly based on trading style, knowledge and trading experiences from each individual. 
Today I would like to talk about Breakout in trading. When it is breakout, when it is failed breakout. 
Before talking about breakout, we need to identify price closes above a  S/R level  or below a  S/R level . Examine the below chart: 







However, in the chart we also find the situations that market didn't follow the mentioned rule. 







In the above case, if we carefully examine, we would see a pair of candle close below a  resistance zone  and make price go down. And price is still following rule of breakout and give confirmation as usual. 






There are a lot of S/R appear in trading market. So, we have to choose by our own which is the S/R zone to play in each situation depending on our own experiences. No situation is exactly the same with each other! In the same above situation, at the same  S/R level  that we identified and used before, prices move differently (at that points, mostly our stoploss is hunted) 












Here, experienced traders would easily recognize failed breakout based on trend analysis, or the way prices breaks, or at least don't follow the breakout. 
We can analyze in a simple way as follow: 






And then price continues its trend 






I have presented some simple cases of successful breakout, failed breakout or fake breakout in the above chart. 
I would like to receive the contributions from the community to learn from each other. Noone is right or wrong all the time. Every wrong or right cases have its own price. Hope that people would not keep silence instread of telling what you know or learned. Nothing has its own value unless it spent some prices. I hope that people would give a way their knowledge, don't try to hide for your own if not we are all failed to this market.

The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y              (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context. We are looking at the ending of the corrective structure. For those who are interested in this formation, you can take a look at my analysis of  AROC              which I have put the link here. You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.50%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar -0.46% . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.50%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)? 

Elliott Waves  tells us that price moves before macro-economics actions. Maybe the news may tell us what I have just said soon.

However, in the chart we also find the situations that market didn't follow the mentioned rule. 







In the above case, if we carefully examine, we would see a pair of candle close below a  resistance zone  and make price go down. And price is still following rule of breakout and give confirmation as usual. 






There are a lot of S/R appear in trading market. So, we have to choose by our own which is the S/R zone to play in each situation depending on our own experiences. No situation is exactly the same with each other! In the same above situation, at the same  S/R level  that we identified and used before, prices move differently (at that points, mostly our stoploss is hunted)

1531055691.0,rzmb44,Looking for Rally to Top and Make a Lower Low Below $5700,"
It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin             . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin              going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin -0.54% . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin -0.54%  going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y              (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context. We are looking at the ending of the corrective structure. For those who are interested in this formation, you can take a look at my analysis of  AROC              which I have put the link here. You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.55%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar -0.46% . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.55%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)? 

Elliott Waves  tells us that price moves before macro-economics actions. Maybe the news may tell us what I have just said soon. 

Good Luck!

Break  support/Resistance , give confirmation? 
- We usually trade base on S/R to find the entry point, exit or to predict the trend. 
- One of an effective and simple way in trading is to trade when price breakout from a  S/R level 
- However, to identify an area or a point of good S/R in trading is mostly based on trading style, knowledge and trading experiences from each individual. 
Today I would like to talk about Breakout in trading. When it is breakout, when it is failed breakout. 
Before talking about breakout, we need to identify price closes above a  S/R level  or below a  S/R level . Examine the below chart: 







However, in the chart we also find the situations that market didn't follow the mentioned rule. 







In the above case, if we carefully examine, we would see a pair of candle close below a  resistance zone  and make price go down. And price is still following rule of breakout and give confirmation as usual. 






There are a lot of S/R appear in trading market. So, we have to choose by our own which is the S/R zone to play in each situation depending on our own experiences. No situation is exactly the same with each other! In the same above situation, at the same  S/R level  that we identified and used before, prices move differently (at that points, mostly our stoploss is hunted) 












Here, experienced traders would easily recognize failed breakout based on trend analysis, or the way prices breaks, or at least don't follow the breakout. 
We can analyze in a simple way as follow: 






And then price continues its trend 






I have presented some simple cases of successful breakout, failed breakout or fake breakout in the above chart. 
I would like to receive the contributions from the community to learn from each other. Noone is right or wrong all the time. Every wrong or right cases have its own price. Hope that people would not keep silence instread of telling what you know or learned. Nothing has its own value unless it spent some prices. I hope that people would give a way their knowledge, don't try to hide for your own if not we are all failed to this market.

The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y              (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context.

You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.54%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar -0.46% . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.54%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)?

1531055691.0,rzmb44,Looking for Rally to Top and Make a Lower Low Below $5700,"
It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin             . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin              going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin -0.39% . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin -0.39%  going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

But the overall atmosphere of  Bitcoin -0.39%  has changed significantly over of the past. At the moment, the 7-month decline flag has been completely broken. That is a good sign.

The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y 0.66%  (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context. We are looking at the ending of the corrective structure. For those who are interested in this formation, you can take a look at my analysis of  AROC -0.79%  which I have put the link here. You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.39%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar -0.46% . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.39%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)? 

Elliott Waves  tells us that price moves before macro-economics actions. Maybe the news may tell us what I have just said soon. 

Good Luck!

Break  support/Resistance , give confirmation? 
- We usually trade base on S/R to find the entry point, exit or to predict the trend. 
- One of an effective and simple way in trading is to trade when price breakout from a  S/R level 
- However, to identify an area or a point of good S/R in trading is mostly based on trading style, knowledge and trading experiences from each individual. 
Today I would like to talk about Breakout in trading. When it is breakout, when it is failed breakout. 
Before talking about breakout, we need to identify price closes above a  S/R level  or below a  S/R level . Examine the below chart: 







However, in the chart we also find the situations that market didn't follow the mentioned rule. 







In the above case, if we carefully examine, we would see a pair of candle close below a  resistance zone  and make price go down. And price is still following rule of breakout and give confirmation as usual. 






There are a lot of S/R appear in trading market. So, we have to choose by our own which is the S/R zone to play in each situation depending on our own experiences. No situation is exactly the same with each other! In the same above situation, at the same  S/R level  that we identified and used before, prices move differently (at that points, mostly our stoploss is hunted) 












Here, experienced traders would easily recognize failed breakout based on trend analysis, or the way prices breaks, or at least don't follow the breakout. 
We can analyze in a simple way as follow: 






And then price continues its trend 






I have presented some simple cases of successful breakout, failed breakout or fake breakout in the above chart. 
I would like to receive the contributions from the community to learn from each other. Noone is right or wrong all the time. Every wrong or right cases have its own price. Hope that people would not keep silence instread of telling what you know or learned. Nothing has its own value unless it spent some prices. I hope that people would give a way their knowledge, don't try to hide for your own if not we are all failed to this market.

The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y              (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context. We are looking at the ending of the corrective structure. For those who are interested in this formation, you can take a look at my analysis of  AROC              which I have put the link here. You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.40%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar -0.46% . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.40%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)? 

Elliott Waves  tells us that price moves before macro-economics actions. Maybe the news may tell us what I have just said soon.

However, in the chart we also find the situations that market didn't follow the mentioned rule. 







In the above case, if we carefully examine, we would see a pair of candle close below a  resistance zone  and make price go down. And price is still following rule of breakout and give confirmation as usual. 






There are a lot of S/R appear in trading market. So, we have to choose by our own which is the S/R zone to play in each situation depending on our own experiences. No situation is exactly the same with each other! In the same above situation, at the same  S/R level  that we identified and used before, prices move differently (at that points, mostly our stoploss is hunted)

1531055691.0,rzmb44,Looking for Rally to Top and Make a Lower Low Below $5700,"
It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin -0.41% . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin -0.41%  going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin -0.42% . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin -0.42%  going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y 0.66%  (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context. We are looking at the ending of the corrective structure. For those who are interested in this formation, you can take a look at my analysis of  AROC -0.79%  which I have put the link here. You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.42%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar -0.46% . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.42%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)? 

Elliott Waves  tells us that price moves before macro-economics actions. Maybe the news may tell us what I have just said soon. 

Good Luck!

Break  support/Resistance , give confirmation? 
- We usually trade base on S/R to find the entry point, exit or to predict the trend. 
- One of an effective and simple way in trading is to trade when price breakout from a  S/R level 
- However, to identify an area or a point of good S/R in trading is mostly based on trading style, knowledge and trading experiences from each individual. 
Today I would like to talk about Breakout in trading. When it is breakout, when it is failed breakout. 
Before talking about breakout, we need to identify price closes above a  S/R level  or below a  S/R level . Examine the below chart: 







However, in the chart we also find the situations that market didn't follow the mentioned rule. 







In the above case, if we carefully examine, we would see a pair of candle close below a  resistance zone  and make price go down. And price is still following rule of breakout and give confirmation as usual. 






There are a lot of S/R appear in trading market. So, we have to choose by our own which is the S/R zone to play in each situation depending on our own experiences. No situation is exactly the same with each other! In the same above situation, at the same  S/R level  that we identified and used before, prices move differently (at that points, mostly our stoploss is hunted) 












Here, experienced traders would easily recognize failed breakout based on trend analysis, or the way prices breaks, or at least don't follow the breakout. 
We can analyze in a simple way as follow: 






And then price continues its trend 






I have presented some simple cases of successful breakout, failed breakout or fake breakout in the above chart. 
I would like to receive the contributions from the community to learn from each other. Noone is right or wrong all the time. Every wrong or right cases have its own price. Hope that people would not keep silence instread of telling what you know or learned. Nothing has its own value unless it spent some prices. I hope that people would give a way their knowledge, don't try to hide for your own if not we are all failed to this market.

The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y              (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context. We are looking at the ending of the corrective structure. For those who are interested in this formation, you can take a look at my analysis of  AROC              which I have put the link here. You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.43%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar -0.46% . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.43%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)? 

Elliott Waves  tells us that price moves before macro-economics actions. Maybe the news may tell us what I have just said soon. 

Good Luck!

- We usually trade base on S/R to find the entry point, exit or to predict the trend. 
- One of an effective and simple way in trading is to trade when price breakout from a  S/R level 
- However, to identify an area or a point of good S/R in trading is mostly based on trading style, knowledge and trading experiences from each individual. 
Today I would like to talk about Breakout in trading. When it is breakout, when it is failed breakout. 
Before talking about breakout, we need to identify price closes above a  S/R level  or below a  S/R level . Examine the below chart: 







However, in the chart we also find the situations that market didn't follow the mentioned rule. 







In the above case, if we carefully examine, we would see a pair of candle close below a  resistance zone  and make price go down. And price is still following rule of breakout and give confirmation as usual. 






There are a lot of S/R appear in trading market. So, we have to choose by our own which is the S/R zone to play in each situation depending on our own experiences. No situation is exactly the same with each other! In the same above situation, at the same  S/R level  that we identified and used before, prices move differently (at that points, mostly our stoploss is hunted) 












Here, experienced traders would easily recognize failed breakout based on trend analysis, or the way prices breaks, or at least don't follow the breakout. 
We can analyze in a simple way as follow: 






And then price continues its trend

1531055691.0,rzmb44,Looking for Rally to Top and Make a Lower Low Below $5700,"
It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin             . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin              going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin -0.43% . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin -0.43%  going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y 0.66%  (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context. We are looking at the ending of the corrective structure. For those who are interested in this formation, you can take a look at my analysis of  AROC -0.79%  which I have put the link here. You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.44%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar -0.46% . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.44%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)? 

Elliott Waves  tells us that price moves before macro-economics actions. Maybe the news may tell us what I have just said soon. 

Good Luck!

Break  support/Resistance , give confirmation? 
- We usually trade base on S/R to find the entry point, exit or to predict the trend. 
- One of an effective and simple way in trading is to trade when price breakout from a  S/R level 
- However, to identify an area or a point of good S/R in trading is mostly based on trading style, knowledge and trading experiences from each individual. 
Today I would like to talk about Breakout in trading. When it is breakout, when it is failed breakout. 
Before talking about breakout, we need to identify price closes above a  S/R level  or below a  S/R level . Examine the below chart: 







However, in the chart we also find the situations that market didn't follow the mentioned rule. 







In the above case, if we carefully examine, we would see a pair of candle close below a  resistance zone  and make price go down. And price is still following rule of breakout and give confirmation as usual. 






There are a lot of S/R appear in trading market. So, we have to choose by our own which is the S/R zone to play in each situation depending on our own experiences. No situation is exactly the same with each other! In the same above situation, at the same  S/R level  that we identified and used before, prices move differently (at that points, mostly our stoploss is hunted) 












Here, experienced traders would easily recognize failed breakout based on trend analysis, or the way prices breaks, or at least don't follow the breakout. 
We can analyze in a simple way as follow: 






And then price continues its trend 






I have presented some simple cases of successful breakout, failed breakout or fake breakout in the above chart. 
I would like to receive the contributions from the community to learn from each other. Noone is right or wrong all the time. Every wrong or right cases have its own price. Hope that people would not keep silence instread of telling what you know or learned. Nothing has its own value unless it spent some prices. I hope that people would give a way their knowledge, don't try to hide for your own if not we are all failed to this market.

The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y 0.66%  (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context. We are looking at the ending of the corrective structure. For those who are interested in this formation, you can take a look at my analysis of  AROC -0.79%  which I have put the link here. You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.44%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar -0.46% . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.44%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)? 

Elliott Waves  tells us that price moves before macro-economics actions. Maybe the news may tell us what I have just said soon.

In the above case, if we carefully examine, we would see a pair of candle close below a  resistance zone  and make price go down. And price is still following rule of breakout and give confirmation as usual. 






There are a lot of S/R appear in trading market. So, we have to choose by our own which is the S/R zone to play in each situation depending on our own experiences. No situation is exactly the same with each other! In the same above situation, at the same  S/R level  that we identified and used before, prices move differently (at that points, mostly our stoploss is hunted)

1531055691.0,rzmb44,Looking for Rally to Top and Make a Lower Low Below $5700,"
It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin -0.44% . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin -0.44%  going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin -0.44% . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin -0.44%  going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y 0.66%  (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context. We are looking at the ending of the corrective structure. For those who are interested in this formation, you can take a look at my analysis of  AROC -0.79%  which I have put the link here. You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.44%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar -0.46% . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.44%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)? 

Elliott Waves  tells us that price moves before macro-economics actions. Maybe the news may tell us what I have just said soon. 

Good Luck!

Break  support/Resistance , give confirmation? 
- We usually trade base on S/R to find the entry point, exit or to predict the trend. 
- One of an effective and simple way in trading is to trade when price breakout from a  S/R level 
- However, to identify an area or a point of good S/R in trading is mostly based on trading style, knowledge and trading experiences from each individual. 
Today I would like to talk about Breakout in trading. When it is breakout, when it is failed breakout. 
Before talking about breakout, we need to identify price closes above a  S/R level  or below a  S/R level . Examine the below chart: 







However, in the chart we also find the situations that market didn't follow the mentioned rule. 







In the above case, if we carefully examine, we would see a pair of candle close below a  resistance zone  and make price go down. And price is still following rule of breakout and give confirmation as usual. 






There are a lot of S/R appear in trading market. So, we have to choose by our own which is the S/R zone to play in each situation depending on our own experiences. No situation is exactly the same with each other! In the same above situation, at the same  S/R level  that we identified and used before, prices move differently (at that points, mostly our stoploss is hunted) 












Here, experienced traders would easily recognize failed breakout based on trend analysis, or the way prices breaks, or at least don't follow the breakout. 
We can analyze in a simple way as follow: 






And then price continues its trend 






I have presented some simple cases of successful breakout, failed breakout or fake breakout in the above chart. 
I would like to receive the contributions from the community to learn from each other. Noone is right or wrong all the time. Every wrong or right cases have its own price. Hope that people would not keep silence instread of telling what you know or learned. Nothing has its own value unless it spent some prices. I hope that people would give a way their knowledge, don't try to hide for your own if not we are all failed to this market.

The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y 0.66%  (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context. We are looking at the ending of the corrective structure. For those who are interested in this formation, you can take a look at my analysis of  AROC -0.79%  which I have put the link here. You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.44%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar -0.46% . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.44%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)? 

Elliott Waves  tells us that price moves before macro-economics actions. Maybe the news may tell us what I have just said soon.

However, in the chart we also find the situations that market didn't follow the mentioned rule. 







In the above case, if we carefully examine, we would see a pair of candle close below a  resistance zone  and make price go down. And price is still following rule of breakout and give confirmation as usual. 






There are a lot of S/R appear in trading market. So, we have to choose by our own which is the S/R zone to play in each situation depending on our own experiences. No situation is exactly the same with each other! In the same above situation, at the same  S/R level  that we identified and used before, prices move differently (at that points, mostly our stoploss is hunted) 












Here, experienced traders would easily recognize failed breakout based on trend analysis, or the way prices breaks, or at least don't follow the breakout. 
We can analyze in a simple way as follow:

1531055691.0,rzmb44,Looking for Rally to Top and Make a Lower Low Below $5700,"
It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin -0.44% . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin -0.44%  going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin -0.44% . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin -0.44%  going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y              (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context. We are looking at the ending of the corrective structure. For those who are interested in this formation, you can take a look at my analysis of  AROC              which I have put the link here. You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.44%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar -0.46% . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.44%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)? 

Elliott Waves  tells us that price moves before macro-economics actions. Maybe the news may tell us what I have just said soon. 

Good Luck!

Break  support/Resistance , give confirmation? 
- We usually trade base on S/R to find the entry point, exit or to predict the trend. 
- One of an effective and simple way in trading is to trade when price breakout from a  S/R level 
- However, to identify an area or a point of good S/R in trading is mostly based on trading style, knowledge and trading experiences from each individual. 
Today I would like to talk about Breakout in trading. When it is breakout, when it is failed breakout. 
Before talking about breakout, we need to identify price closes above a  S/R level  or below a  S/R level . Examine the below chart: 







However, in the chart we also find the situations that market didn't follow the mentioned rule. 







In the above case, if we carefully examine, we would see a pair of candle close below a  resistance zone  and make price go down. And price is still following rule of breakout and give confirmation as usual. 






There are a lot of S/R appear in trading market. So, we have to choose by our own which is the S/R zone to play in each situation depending on our own experiences. No situation is exactly the same with each other! In the same above situation, at the same  S/R level  that we identified and used before, prices move differently (at that points, mostly our stoploss is hunted) 












Here, experienced traders would easily recognize failed breakout based on trend analysis, or the way prices breaks, or at least don't follow the breakout. 
We can analyze in a simple way as follow: 






And then price continues its trend 






I have presented some simple cases of successful breakout, failed breakout or fake breakout in the above chart. 
I would like to receive the contributions from the community to learn from each other. Noone is right or wrong all the time. Every wrong or right cases have its own price. Hope that people would not keep silence instread of telling what you know or learned. Nothing has its own value unless it spent some prices. I hope that people would give a way their knowledge, don't try to hide for your own if not we are all failed to this market.

The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y              (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context. We are looking at the ending of the corrective structure. For those who are interested in this formation, you can take a look at my analysis of  AROC -0.79%  which I have put the link here. You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.43%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar -0.46% . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.43%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)? 

Elliott Waves  tells us that price moves before macro-economics actions. Maybe the news may tell us what I have just said soon. 

Good Luck!

- We usually trade base on S/R to find the entry point, exit or to predict the trend. 
- One of an effective and simple way in trading is to trade when price breakout from a  S/R level 
- However, to identify an area or a point of good S/R in trading is mostly based on trading style, knowledge and trading experiences from each individual. 
Today I would like to talk about Breakout in trading. When it is breakout, when it is failed breakout. 
Before talking about breakout, we need to identify price closes above a  S/R level  or below a  S/R level . Examine the below chart: 







However, in the chart we also find the situations that market didn't follow the mentioned rule. 







In the above case, if we carefully examine, we would see a pair of candle close below a  resistance zone  and make price go down. And price is still following rule of breakout and give confirmation as usual. 






There are a lot of S/R appear in trading market. So, we have to choose by our own which is the S/R zone to play in each situation depending on our own experiences. No situation is exactly the same with each other! In the same above situation, at the same  S/R level  that we identified and used before, prices move differently (at that points, mostly our stoploss is hunted) 












Here, experienced traders would easily recognize failed breakout based on trend analysis, or the way prices breaks, or at least don't follow the breakout. 
We can analyze in a simple way as follow: 






And then price continues its trend

1531055691.0,rzmb44,Looking for Rally to Top and Make a Lower Low Below $5700,"
It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin -0.43% . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin -0.43%  going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin -0.37% . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin -0.37%  going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y              (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context. We are looking at the ending of the corrective structure. For those who are interested in this formation, you can take a look at my analysis of  AROC -0.79%  which I have put the link here. You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.36%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar -0.46% . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.36%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)? 

Elliott Waves  tells us that price moves before macro-economics actions. Maybe the news may tell us what I have just said soon. 

Good Luck!

Break  support/Resistance , give confirmation? 
- We usually trade base on S/R to find the entry point, exit or to predict the trend. 
- One of an effective and simple way in trading is to trade when price breakout from a  S/R level 
- However, to identify an area or a point of good S/R in trading is mostly based on trading style, knowledge and trading experiences from each individual. 
Today I would like to talk about Breakout in trading. When it is breakout, when it is failed breakout. 
Before talking about breakout, we need to identify price closes above a  S/R level  or below a  S/R level . Examine the below chart: 







However, in the chart we also find the situations that market didn't follow the mentioned rule. 







In the above case, if we carefully examine, we would see a pair of candle close below a  resistance zone  and make price go down. And price is still following rule of breakout and give confirmation as usual. 






There are a lot of S/R appear in trading market. So, we have to choose by our own which is the S/R zone to play in each situation depending on our own experiences. No situation is exactly the same with each other! In the same above situation, at the same  S/R level  that we identified and used before, prices move differently (at that points, mostly our stoploss is hunted) 












Here, experienced traders would easily recognize failed breakout based on trend analysis, or the way prices breaks, or at least don't follow the breakout. 
We can analyze in a simple way as follow: 






And then price continues its trend 






I have presented some simple cases of successful breakout, failed breakout or fake breakout in the above chart. 
I would like to receive the contributions from the community to learn from each other. Noone is right or wrong all the time. Every wrong or right cases have its own price. Hope that people would not keep silence instread of telling what you know or learned. Nothing has its own value unless it spent some prices. I hope that people would give a way their knowledge, don't try to hide for your own if not we are all failed to this market.

We are seeing the W bottom ""breakout"" playing out in  BTC -0.34% .  See how the previous resistance at 6300 now becomes support for the breakout.  Here are the current target of potential.

The Big Picture 







The Wave Structure 
As you can see, from the left, we have the super cycle impulse 1-2-3-4-5. Then we have a double combination for the corrective wave  W-X-Y              (in black) consisting of  
1.  Zig-Zag  (pink) 
2. X 
3.  Ending Diagonal  (red) 

The entire picture is itself a  descending triangle . In traditional  technical analysis , it is actually a  bearish  formation. However,  Elliott Waves  gives it the proper context. We are looking at the ending of the corrective structure. For those who are interested in this formation, you can take a look at my analysis of  AROC              which I have put the link here. You can see that the formation itself was actually a  bullish  formation instead of  bearish , just like the current formation. 

We also see that  Bitcoin -0.34%  did break out of the triangle on the 30th of June. What this means is that our stop will be below the low made then: < $5780. 

The Macro Setup 
In this section, I talk about what I see in the financial markets as a whole. If you have followed my recent ideas, you will know that I have been getting VERY  BEARISH  on the  US Dollar -0.46% . What this means is that financial instruments priced in USD will strengthen.  Bitcoin -0.34%  is no exception here. I do not speculate on the fundamental economic reasons. The news may tell you that it is due to the trade war. Maybe Trump may counter on the Chinese Yuan depreciation (note that I have a  BULLISH  analysis on the Chinese Yuan)? 

Elliott Waves  tells us that price moves before macro-economics actions. Maybe the news may tell us what I have just said soon. 

Good Luck!

Break  support/Resistance , give confirmation? 
- We usually trade base on S/R to find the entry point, exit or to predict the trend. 
- One of an effective and simple way in trading is to trade when price breakout from a  S/R level 
- However, to identify an area or a point of good S/R in trading is mostly based on trading style, knowledge and trading experiences from each individual. 
Today I would like to talk about Breakout in trading. When it is breakout, when it is failed breakout. 
Before talking about breakout, we need to identify price closes above a  S/R level  or below a  S/R level . Examine the below chart: 







However, in the chart we also find the situations that market didn't follow the mentioned rule. 







In the above case, if we carefully examine, we would see a pair of candle close below a  resistance zone  and make price go down. And price is still following rule of breakout and give confirmation as usual. 






There are a lot of S/R appear in trading market. So, we have to choose by our own which is the S/R zone to play in each situation depending on our own experiences. No situation is exactly the same with each other! In the same above situation, at the same  S/R level  that we identified and used before, prices move differently (at that points, mostly our stoploss is hunted) 












Here, experienced traders would easily recognize failed breakout based on trend analysis, or the way prices breaks, or at least don't follow the breakout. 
We can analyze in a simple way as follow: 






And then price continues its trend 






I have presented some simple cases of successful breakout, failed breakout or fake breakout in the above chart. 
I would like to receive the contributions from the community to learn from each other. Noone is right or wrong all the time. Every wrong or right cases have its own price. Hope that people would not keep silence instread of telling what you know or learned. Nothing has its own value unless it spent some prices. I hope that people would give a way their knowledge, don't try to hide for your own if not we are all failed to this market.

Hello guys,  




In this post I'll suggest the next pump by the timeframe of the  bearish  opposite. In the exact same duration of 3D & 8H we would squeeze to the major Bull uprtrend support. Thats the point where I think the price action will happen. T1 would  be 7149. Fingers crossed.  


What do you think? 

Cheers

1531055691.0,rzmb44,Looking for Rally to Top and Make a Lower Low Below $5700,"
It’s my belief that probabilities are high that we go lower and that this next low could be the major bear market low or at least the 2018 low. If not late July then late September, but I’m preparing to short this rally and buy the next low for a long term  bullish  swing trade. 

I am not convinced this current rally has staying power. However, I will explain why I believe that and what would change my mind.  

First let me explain the foundation of the  bearish  case 

Overall when you have a big  bullish  parabolic move, it always comes with a bear market. And based on the accelerating channel in 2017, the ideal time for the 2018 low would be late July to late September 2018.   
Bitcoin has a weekly cycle that is usually lasts 24-28 weeks. Late July would be around the 25 week mark. 
The 60 day cycle low is due in late July. 
I did not find the June bottom to be convincing of a rally that had a lot of  bullish  conviction. This generally looks like profit taking and series of small short queezes rather than  bullish  participation. 
Usually a strong rally comes after a capitulation and we have not seen capitulation. 
BTCUSD longs are piling up.  
Low  volume 
Medium term trend is still  bearish  until we get a daily swing low. 
 
Can I be wrong? What is the  bullish  case? 

Yes, of course. This is why risk management is more important than analysis. I’ve done well since December, but the market has fooled me at times and generally I took profits too early several times.  Cycles are not perfect and sometimes you get a slow turn.   

If the market continues to march higher I will eventually become  bullish . The big key to this is to close above the breakdown  trendline  green area above $7300 and then make a higher low late July and higher high in August.  Both would turn the weekly chart and I’ll become a dip buyer. It would be arrogant and simply stupid to think that we can’t turn  bullish . It’s  bitcoin -0.34% . In the long run it's going much higher and a huge crypto bull so I’d love to see us turn and I would gladly move to the  bullish  side.  I just want to see more evidence before I turn  bullish . 

My biggest concern if we don't make lower lows in July is a long sideways ranging market.     








Thats an example of  bitcoin -0.34%  going into a tight range for 5 month in 2016. This is a real possibility, it's tough trade.  Cycles are never clear. 90% of people aren’t ready to trade a long tight range. 

Trading the  Bearish  Scenario 

So if we drop in the next 5 days, we’d have a little less than 3 weeks of downside.  If this rally continues past July 12th, then I start to get neutral. If the rally makes a high past July 15th then I’d lose confidence in a lower low in late July. A rally that long, this late in a 60 day cycle is definitely  bullish  and more than just a bear market bounce.  So I have to change my strategy in that case.   

Again, with proper risk management this is not hard to trade.  
I go short here, watch for continued trading above $6800 and get cautious possibly cover some of my short with a hard stop at $6880 where I would get out and watch price action with a small loss. 
I go short at $7100 area and again, be careful with price action. And close near $7300 and I’m cautious and in that green area, i’m out.  My  bearish  scenario loses major probabilities at that price level. Too much risk to continue to short 
If we proceed down, I add when in a position of strength at $6400, $6100.  This also depends on how close we are to the timing band of the cycle low. 
 
I put the  bearish  scenario at 75%.  But again, If bullishness continues and I manage my risk so I don’t take big losses if I’m wrong. I cannot stress how important this is.   

But… if I’m right, this will be a nice trade and we’ll be mentally prepared to buy a major low. Capitulation would be an amazing opportunity if we get it.

At 1 hour timezone, there are signs of falling or at least temporary rest, which, if realized,will be up to 6650 and then 6590 fall. 

But the overall atmosphere of  Bitcoin -0.34%  has changed significantly over of the past. At the moment, the 7-month decline flag has been completely broken. That is a good sign.

Top could already be in, but I do expect another small push up to somewhere between the 50%-65% fib levels 
From there it looks like we are in a good position to start going down towards the $5.3k region
