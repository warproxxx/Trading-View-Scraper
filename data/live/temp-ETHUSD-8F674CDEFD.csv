1531072924.0,infbp22,ETH: finally breaking out of descending resistance?,"
ETH has been held down by descending resistance (orange line) since its last run up on May 5th. It has finally broken free of  it, but we want to confirm it's not a throw-over first. I'll be very  bullish  if we correct out of this ascending  wedge  and bounce off either green box. Preferably the lower one, as we could get a wick below the orange line to test the bulls and establish support hopefully. Confirmations are much stronger if tested and proven to hold above/below.
