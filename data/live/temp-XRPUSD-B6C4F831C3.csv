1530118189.0,JohnnyPurtoy98,XRPUSD - descending triangle!,"
A  descending triangle  has formed, this usually shows signs of a bear move, but in this case we could see the price break out the  resistance level  of the triangle. We would have to wait and see for the direction of this pair and I would be posting regular updates to keep everyone updated about what is happening with this pair. The  RSI  is at an oversold level meaning the price may make its way back up and if it has gained enough momentum may even be able to break, a break is very likely as the triangle has become very narrow.

This is the market cap (kind of outdated, I should change the coins but I'm just not in the mood). I'm gonna keep it simple this time. One line that describes a lot of potential ;). Never forget to look at the big picture. You don't understand the behaviour of a Termite colony by studying the ant solely. 


Happy trading!
