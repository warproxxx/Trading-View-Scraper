It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.07%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE -2.09%  has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY -0.68% volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook 2.41%  has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.07%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.07%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.07%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

1531080838.0,Giorgioversace,Bitcoin: possibly bottomed at 5.800$,"
Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin 0.00%  has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc 0.00%  was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc 0.00%  created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin 0.00%  should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin 0.00%  could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin 0.00%  ""100$ on  bitcoin 0.00%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin 0.00%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin 0.00%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin 0.00% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin 0.00%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

- the  RSI , which is indicating a divergence

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.04%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.04%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.04%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.04% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.04% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only.

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.05%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE -2.09%  has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY             volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook              has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.05%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.05%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.05%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin              has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc              was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc              created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin              should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin              could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.05%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.05%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.05%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.05%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.05% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.05%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin              is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE              has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY             volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook              has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin              going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin              will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC              losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin -0.06%  has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc -0.06%  was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc -0.06%  created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin -0.06%  should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin -0.06%  could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.06%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.06%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.06%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.06%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.06% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.06%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin              is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE              has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY             volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook              has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin              going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin              will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC              losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin              has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc              was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc              created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin              should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin              could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.07%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.07%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.07%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.07%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.07% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.07%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

In our view, the  BTC -0.07%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.07%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.07%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.07% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.07% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only. 

Sincerely, thank you!

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.07%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE -2.09%  has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY             volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook              has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.07%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.07%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.07%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin              has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc              was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc              created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin              should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin              could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.07%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.07%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.07%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.07%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.07% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.07%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

- the  RSI , which is indicating a divergence

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.07%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.07%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.07%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.07% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.07% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only.

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin              is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE              has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY             volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook              has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin              going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin              will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC              losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin -0.07%  has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc -0.07%  was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc -0.07%  created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin -0.07%  should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin -0.07%  could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.07%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.07%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.07%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.07%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.07% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.07%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

 BTC -0.14%  / USD - H4 - Towards the price target of 7800 

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.14%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.14%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.14%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.14% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.14% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only.

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.14%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE              has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY -0.68% volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook              has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.14%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.14%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.14%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin              has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc              was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc              created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin              should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin              could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.14%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.14%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.14%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.14%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.14% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.14%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

- the  RSI , which is indicating a divergence

 BTC -0.14%  / USD - H4 - Towards the price target of 7800 

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.14%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.14%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR              50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.14%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.14% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.14% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only. 

Sincerely, thank you!

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.14%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE -2.09%  has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY             volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook 2.41%  has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.14%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.14%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.14%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

1531080838.0,Giorgioversace,Bitcoin: possibly bottomed at 5.800$,"
Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin              has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc              was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc              created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin              should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin              could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.14%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.14%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.14%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.14%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.14% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.14%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

- the  RSI , which is indicating a divergence

 BTC -0.10%  / USD - H4 - Towards the price target of 7800 

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.10%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.10%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.10%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.10% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.10% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only.

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.10%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE -2.09%  has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY             volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook              has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.10%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.10%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.10%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

1531080838.0,Giorgioversace,Bitcoin: possibly bottomed at 5.800$,"
Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin -0.10%  has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc -0.10%  was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc -0.10%  created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin -0.10%  should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin -0.10%  could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.10%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.10%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.10%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.10%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.10% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.10%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

- the  RSI , which is indicating a divergence

 BTC -0.10%  / USD - H4 - Towards the price target of 7800 

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.10%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.10%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.10%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.10% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.10% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only.

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.10%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE -2.09%  has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY -0.68% volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook 2.41%  has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.10%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.10%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.10%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

1531080838.0,Giorgioversace,Bitcoin: possibly bottomed at 5.800$,"
Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin -0.10%  has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc -0.10%  was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc -0.10%  created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin -0.10%  should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin -0.10%  could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.10%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.10%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.10%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.10%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.10% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.10%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

- the  RSI , which is indicating a divergence

 BTC -0.10%  / USD - H4 - Towards the price target of 7800 

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.10%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.10%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.10%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.10% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.10% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only.

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.10%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE -2.09%  has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY -0.68% volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook 2.41%  has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.10%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.10%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.10%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

1531080838.0,Giorgioversace,Bitcoin: possibly bottomed at 5.800$,"
Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin -0.10%  has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc -0.10%  was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc -0.10%  created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin -0.10%  should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin -0.10%  could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.10%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.10%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.10%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.10%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.10% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.10%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

- the  RSI , which is indicating a divergence

 BTC -0.10%  / USD - H4 - Towards the price target of 7800 

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.10%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.10%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.10%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.10% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.10% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only.

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.10%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE -2.09%  has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY             volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook              has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.10%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.10%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.10%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

1531080838.0,Giorgioversace,Bitcoin: possibly bottomed at 5.800$,"
Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin -0.10%  has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc -0.10%  was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc -0.10%  created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin -0.10%  should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin -0.10%  could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.10%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.10%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.10%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.10%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.10% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.10%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

- the  RSI , which is indicating a divergence

 BTC -0.10%  / USD - H4 - Towards the price target of 7800 

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.10%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.10%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.10%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.10% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.10% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only. 

Sincerely, thank you!

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.10%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE              has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY -0.68% volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook 2.41%  has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.10%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.10%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.10%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

1531080838.0,Giorgioversace,Bitcoin: possibly bottomed at 5.800$,"
Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin -0.10%  has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc -0.10%  was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc -0.10%  created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin -0.10%  should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin -0.10%  could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.10%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.10%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.10%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.10%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.10% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.10%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

hey traders, as you can see we had a big rejection on the 5700 level, now bulls are trying to take control but we are seeing some weakness which we can see on: 

- the  RSI , which is indicating a divergence

 BTC -0.10%  / USD - H4 - Towards the price target of 7800 

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.10%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.10%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.10%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.10% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.10% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only.

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.10%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE              has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY             volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook              has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.10%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.10%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.10%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

1531080838.0,Giorgioversace,Bitcoin: possibly bottomed at 5.800$,"
Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin -0.10%  has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc -0.10%  was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc -0.10%  created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin -0.10%  should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin -0.10%  could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.10%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.10%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.10%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.10%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.10% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.10%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

- the  RSI , which is indicating a divergence

 BTC -0.14%  / USD - H4 - Towards the price target of 7800 

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.14%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.14%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.14%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.14% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.14% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only. 

Sincerely, thank you!

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.14%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE -2.09%  has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY -0.68% volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook 2.41%  has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.14%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.14%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.14%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

1531080838.0,Giorgioversace,Bitcoin: possibly bottomed at 5.800$,"
Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin -0.16%  has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc -0.16%  was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc -0.16%  created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin -0.16%  should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin -0.16%  could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.16%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.16%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.16%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.16%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.16% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.16%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

 BTC -0.17%  / USD - H4 - Towards the price target of 7800 

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.17%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.17%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.17%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.17% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.17% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only.

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin              is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE              has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY             volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook              has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin              going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin              will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC              losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

1531080838.0,Giorgioversace,Bitcoin: possibly bottomed at 5.800$,"
Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin -0.17%  has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc -0.17%  was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc -0.17%  created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin -0.17%  should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin -0.17%  could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.17%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.17%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.17%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.17%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.17% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.17%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

hey traders, as you can see we had a big rejection on the 5700 level, now bulls are trying to take control but we are seeing some weakness which we can see on: 

- the  RSI , which is indicating a divergence 
- the descending  volume  which indicates, weakness in the uptrend. 

on the short-mid term we see a  head and shoulders  formation, which will make the price to retrace to 6200 or 6200 to start moving higher if not, the las support would be last 5700 down.  BITFINEX:BTCUSD -0.17%

 BTC -0.17%  / USD - H4 - Towards the price target of 7800 

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.17%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.17%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.17%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.17% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.17% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only. 

Sincerely, thank you!

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.17%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE -2.09%  has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY             volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook              has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.17%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.17%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.17%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

1531080838.0,Giorgioversace,Bitcoin: possibly bottomed at 5.800$,"
Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin -0.19%  has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc -0.19%  was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc -0.19%  created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin -0.19%  should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin -0.19%  could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.19%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.19%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.19%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.19%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.19% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.19%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

- the  RSI , which is indicating a divergence

 BTC -0.17%  / USD - H4 - Towards the price target of 7800 

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.17%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.17%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.17%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.17% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.17% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only.

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.17%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE              has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY -0.68% volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook              has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.17%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.17%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.17%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

1531080838.0,Giorgioversace,Bitcoin: possibly bottomed at 5.800$,"
Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin -0.16%  has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc -0.16%  was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc -0.16%  created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin -0.16%  should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin -0.16%  could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.14%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.14%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.14%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.14%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.14% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.14%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

- the  RSI , which is indicating a divergence

 BTC -0.13%  / USD - H4 - Towards the price target of 7800 

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.13%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.13%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.13%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.13% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.13% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only.

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.13%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE              has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY             volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook 2.41%  has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.13%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.13%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.13%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

1531080838.0,Giorgioversace,Bitcoin: possibly bottomed at 5.800$,"
Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin              has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc              was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc              created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin              should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin              could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.14%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.14%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.14%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.14%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.14% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.14%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

- the  RSI , which is indicating a divergence

 BTC -0.14%  / USD - H4 - Towards the price target of 7800 

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.14%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.14%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.14%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.14% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.14% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only. 

Sincerely, thank you!

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.14%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE              has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY -0.68% volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook              has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.14%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.14%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.14%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

1531080838.0,Giorgioversace,Bitcoin: possibly bottomed at 5.800$,"
Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin -0.15%  has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc -0.15%  was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc -0.15%  created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin -0.15%  should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin -0.15%  could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.15%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.15%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.15%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.15%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.15% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.15%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

 BTC -0.15%  / USD - H4 - Towards the price target of 7800 

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.15%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.15%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.15%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.15% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.15% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only.

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.14%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE -2.09%  has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY             volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook              has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.14%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.14%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.14%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

1531080838.0,Giorgioversace,Bitcoin: possibly bottomed at 5.800$,"
Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin -0.14%  has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc -0.14%  was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc -0.14%  created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin -0.14%  should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin -0.14%  could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.14%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.14%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.14%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.14%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.14% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.14%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

 BTC -0.14%  / USD - H4 - Towards the price target of 7800 

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.14%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.14%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.14%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.14% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.14% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only. 

Sincerely, thank you!

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.13%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE -2.09%  has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY -0.68% volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook 2.41%  has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.13%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.13%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.13%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

1531080838.0,Giorgioversace,Bitcoin: possibly bottomed at 5.800$,"
Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin -0.14%  has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc -0.14%  was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc -0.14%  created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin -0.14%  should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin -0.14%  could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.14%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.14%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.14%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.14%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.14% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.14%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

 BTC -0.14%  / USD - H4 - Towards the price target of 7800 

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.14%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.14%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.14%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.14% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.14% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only. 

Sincerely, thank you!

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.14%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE -2.09%  has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY -0.68% volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook 2.41%  has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.14%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.14%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.14%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

1531080838.0,Giorgioversace,Bitcoin: possibly bottomed at 5.800$,"
Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin -0.15%  has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc -0.15%  was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc -0.15%  created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin -0.15%  should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin -0.15%  could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.15%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.15%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.15%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.15%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.15% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.15%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

 BTC -0.14%  / USD - H4 - Towards the price target of 7800 

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.14%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.14%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.14%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.14% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.14% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only.

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.14%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE -2.09%  has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY             volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook              has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.14%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.14%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.14%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

1531080838.0,Giorgioversace,Bitcoin: possibly bottomed at 5.800$,"
Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin              has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc              was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc              created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin              should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin              could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.17%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.17%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.17%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.17%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.17% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.17%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

hey traders, as you can see we had a big rejection on the 5700 level, now bulls are trying to take control but we are seeing some weakness which we can see on: 

- the  RSI , which is indicating a divergence 
- the descending  volume  which indicates, weakness in the uptrend. 

on the short-mid term we see a  head and shoulders  formation, which will make the price to retrace to 6200 or 6200 to start moving higher if not, the las support would be last 5700 down.  BITFINEX:BTCUSD -0.17%

 BTC -0.17%  / USD - H4 - Towards the price target of 7800 

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.17%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.17%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR              50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.17%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.17% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.17% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only. 

Sincerely, thank you!

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.17%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE -2.09%  has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY -0.68% volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook 2.41%  has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.17%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.17%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.17%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

1531080838.0,Giorgioversace,Bitcoin: possibly bottomed at 5.800$,"
Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin -0.17%  has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc -0.17%  was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc -0.17%  created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin -0.17%  should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin -0.17%  could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.17%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.17%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.17%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.17%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.17% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.17%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

hey traders, as you can see we had a big rejection on the 5700 level, now bulls are trying to take control but we are seeing some weakness which we can see on: 

- the  RSI , which is indicating a divergence 
- the descending  volume  which indicates, weakness in the uptrend. 

on the short-mid term we see a  head and shoulders  formation, which will make the price to retrace to 6200 or 6200 to start moving higher if not, the las support would be last 5700 down.  BITFINEX:BTCUSD

 BTC -0.17%  / USD - H4 - Towards the price target of 7800 

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.17%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.17%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.17%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.17% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.17% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only.

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.17%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE -2.09%  has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY -0.68% volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook 2.41%  has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.17%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.17%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.17%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

1531080838.0,Giorgioversace,Bitcoin: possibly bottomed at 5.800$,"
Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin -0.16%  has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc -0.16%  was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc -0.16%  created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin -0.16%  should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin -0.16%  could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.16%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.16%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.16%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.16%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.16% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.16%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

- the  RSI , which is indicating a divergence

 BTC -0.17%  / USD - H4 - Towards the price target of 7800 

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.17%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.17%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.17%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.17% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.17% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only. 

Sincerely, thank you!

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin              is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE              has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY             volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook              has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin              going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin              will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC              losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

1531080838.0,Giorgioversace,Bitcoin: possibly bottomed at 5.800$,"
Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin              has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc              was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc              created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin              should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin              could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.21%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.21%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.21%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.21%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.21% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.21%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.

- the  RSI , which is indicating a divergence

 BTC -0.23%  / USD - H4 - Towards the price target of 7800 

Hello 

In our view, the  BTC -0.23%  is still in a rising trend and is preparing to hit a peak of $ 7028.3 on Bitfinex. 
In this area,  BTC -0.23%  will turn around for a correction of 3 days to $ 6558.5 per  Ichimoku  Kumo. We note that on July 11th, we see a possible reversal of the upside potential from $ 6558.5.  FR 0.06%  50% of the previous wave, or US $ 7850.4. 

This possibility is generated by the bottom convergence of the  RSI  and  MACD  indicators at the discounted price of  Bitcoin -0.23%  over the past few months, forming the accumulation area for the medium wave correction increase to prepare for too Long-term reduction of  BTC -0.23% . 

Observed in 1D frame we are calculating the bottom of this wave estimated at 4728.1 USD 

We are waiting for the upcoming events of  BTC -0.23% , we will update continuously on the group's daily, weekly news. Like and share if you like us. Please self-regulate your account, all information is for reference only.

It appears that we are beginning to round a corner on many cryptocurrencies which will likely lead to significantly higher prices than what we saw last year.  

The news is becoming overwhelmingly positive and the massive expansion by exchanges and brokers into more global and traditional markets will lead to the new money buyers required to end this sell-off and begin a new uptrend. Governments are beginning to clarify their regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and we will soon start to see ETFs and related products being traded on major traditional exchanges. Now that the SEC has said that  Bitcoin -0.23%  is not a security it has opened the door to an  ETF  having much greater chance of being accepted, due to the fact that it was rejected last time solely on the fact that it was unregulated. The  CBOE              has just recently put in their application for another  ETF  after the SEC's decision to regulate most cryptocurrencies as non-securities. The China shutdown is also no longer a major factor due to their massive decrease of  CNY             volume , and South Korea seems to be leaning towards loosening up their restrictions towards cryptocurrencies in their country. Even  Facebook 2.41%  has started to allow cryptocurrencies ads again which will help bring more new money into the space. 

Apart from the news starting to improve, we are also seeing major momentum divergences and  elliott wave  patterns forming that indicate that we are at a significant bottom now. There's also  harmonic patterns  forming on multiple other cryptocurrencies, such as LTC, that are very large and will likely provide a large amount of support at these prices. There's also  bullish  divergent bars on multiple cryptos on the weekly charts and below, which again increases the probability of a reversal here. 

With all of these factors occurring simultaneously, it's very likely for some sort of  bullish  retracement or a complete reversal here. Most likely, due to the potential EW pattern, we will see a complete reversal here and it will send us to new all time highs over the next year, with  Bitcoin -0.23%  going as high as 100k sometime next year.  Bitcoin -0.23%  will also probably be one of the less  bullish  currencies because of competition and issues with scalability. We will also probably see a continuation of  BTC -0.23%  losing its market cap dominance to other top cryptocurrencies until it loses its seat as the biggest cryptocurrency.

1531080838.0,Giorgioversace,Bitcoin: possibly bottomed at 5.800$,"
Hi to you if you are still interested with this market after the intense  bearish  pressure of the previous months. 
Bitcoin -0.23%  has possibly bottomed at around 5.800$. 
Weekly chart clearly shows a possible reversal trend start. 
Btc -0.23%  was supported by the weekly 50  Smma , and nicely bounced on it which is very important and actually  bullish , even if this looks weak. 
Btc -0.23%  created a panic false breakout of the extremely important 6.000$ support, which is actually  bullish . There is still a massive daily hidden  bearish  divergence though. 







I feel some incoming possible bullishness : majority of people seems to be  bearish , only a few people is currently trading, more shorts than longs,  volatility  is starting to be low, false breakout of a major  structure support  can start a rally. This clearly ressembles a post bottoming slow rally start.  Bitcoin -0.23%  should normally try to retest the 6k area. 

Of course  Bitcoin -0.23%  could drop again and find new lows. 
If we want to remain careful, which is a good choice in such a market, a stop loss could be set below 5.700$.  
This could be an interesting contrarian trade to start beeing  bullish , as the risk reward is very correct (you could lose 10% but there is a lot of possible upside). 
Breaking the 6k support and settling below it after a weekly candle would signify more incoming downside with high probabilities.

We all know the history of the  bitcoin -0.23%  ""100$ on  bitcoin -0.23%  -0.21% years ago and today I would be a millionaire"". Or at least, so they say around. 
But is it really like that? 
Obviously the answer is not simple and remains in a gray area among those that we could expect. 
Around too many voices, too much confusion. 
So I thought to make a point of the exhaustive situation, from the general to the particular. 

For long-term analysis 
this is the situation between mid-2013 and mid-2015 





		inversion in August 2015, 1 year and 9 months after the bubble. Could this be the fate that awaits bitcoin? 
Note how the times of the oscillations have reversed the inversion of the trend and how this phenomenon has recurred in recent months 
(The long low shadow circled is not counted because on that day the  bitcoin -0.23%  exchange rate decreases by 30%, to the level of $ 600). 





		similar situation to the current one. The same period of time and the same percentage change in price. 










		And finally, after 3 years and 1 month the price of the  bitcoin -0.23%  returns to the previous highs. 




And beyond. 348 days after the story are repeating. + 1500%. 





		The future could therefore be  bullish , with a real inversion in mid-2019, according to the cyclic just considered. 
 This could be the scenario that awaits the fate of the  bitcoin -0.23% 
  
In the medium term (July-October2018) instead, the cyclical analysis gives us a clearer view of the temporal constant: 





		By combining the cycles with Elliott's Wave Theory we can see how the  bearish  tendency, in the medium term, can continue to be burdened by an ascending a-b-c in the short, which can also bring the price to the old resistance levels 11000-12000. 
snapshot
			




		Supports and rasistances with medium-long moving averages and maximum / minimum  pivot  last 80 days 





		Retracement of fibonacci, do we confirm the importance of these prices? 





		will the medium-term trend reverse between the months of August and September and then return  bearish  over the long term, up to the mid-2019 reversal? 

In the short term (July-August) two scenarios open before us: 
- The  bearish  scenario, but not before the rebound 
-The  bullish  scenario, towards the resistance 





		- First targets in zone 8000 usd if the long position is opened; 
- I wait for the conclusion of the uptrend (in all cases, therefore),  bearish  targets below 5500usd. 
at that point the scenario may slightly change, perhaps a period of stasis in the range of the first resistance. 

Conclusions 

It is certain that a very small number of people have managed to get over 70000% more than the invested capital. A part of these people has certainly succeeded thanks to talent and preparation. But the majority succeeded in the task by forgetting them. 
As we can see, the oscillations of the  bitcoin -0.23%  -from 2013 to today- are deep. 
Any hike of -70% -40% could be the good excuse to close. 
""The chances that the majority can grab everything and run away are high and there is a limit to everything"", you could have thought. At that point, maybe you came out well, even if you're not a millionaire yet. 
The only way to get out well is knowing exactly what to do and what can be expected from the future, knowing how to manage the situations that will come without being too surprised.

1531083792.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 133),"
Yesterday we looked at the reasons why I am expecting a $750 - $1,000 pump from the current price level. Today we will look at the mounting  bullish  indicators and ask ourselves if they are enough to bet against the bear trend.  

Today is Sunday and we only have a few hours left before the weekly candle closes.  








We are on a red 8 out of 9 on the TD Sequential and I would really like to see the the countdown complete before this pump continues. If we rally through $6,886 in the next couple hours then we will get a price flip before the red 9. If the countdown doesn't complete this time then it is very likely to complete in the future before this bear markets comes to an end.  

We are bouncing strong off the Stochastic buy signal and the Tweezer bottom. I do think there is plenty of room for this dead cat to bounce, however I am hoping that it doesn’t happen too fast such that it ruins the countdown to a 9.  

The RSI is back above 50 on the  daily chart  for the first time in two months.  








I view this like the 50 yard line of a football field. The bulls are now on offense and getting close to scoring position. This is an important confirmation for me when considering a long.  

There are currently multiple divergences in the On Balance Volume. One in the  daily chart  and one in the weekly.  















This is indicative of bigger players building a long position. The price has stayed level and the buying  volume  has spiked. That tells me that the proverbial smart money is accumulating at these levels and that is a very good sign for the bulls.  

The 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the  daily chart  are posturing for a bullish crossover as well as the 50 and 200 period MA’s on the 4 hour chart. Longing one or both of those buy signals is becoming more and more attractive. If you elect to do so then I would suggest using ½ of your normal position size due to betting against the trend.  

A profit target of $7,500 - $8,000 is reasonable and a 5% stop loss provides a favorable risk:reward.  

I am going to remain on the sidelines for the time being and will be strongly considering buying each of the moving average crossovers. The main reason I am being cautious is because of the visible range  volume  profile. It is showing resistance stacked up from here to $9,000 with a big gap at $5,000 that is begging to be filled. Shorting this bounce and longing $5,000 are my priorities and it will not be a cause for much concern if I miss a move in between.
