BTC- Tripple  Doji  on the 4 hour  indicating an extended move down. 
This can  move down to  6240.






an hour ago





Comment:
					The  extended move down is cancelled only if BTC remains above the support at 6458.

This is my simple analysis. If you remove all thoughts of profit and loss, you're left with a simple  falling wedge  and a bright, innovative future. We may very well see new lows into October while this pattern completes. However, I do not believe in an extended future for this bear market.

 BTC              is bouncing but we certainly have to be aware of the weakness via the  volume  and inability to close over resistance levels. Key test at 7k for this count as can cant break into 1 wave territory on a wave 3. On the downside we have excellent algo target confluence at the 5300 to 5k zone and finally in the 4200 region along with a high  volume  node that I suspect may be the low for  BTC             . We will likely have a period of accumulation following this low after a good bounce as the whales load up for a large degree 3 wave that will  IMO              be quite incredible to be a part of. Not to mention the dollar and central banks are showing weakness, brexit coming soon and the stock market clearly nearing correction time. Will  BTC              be a beneficiary of a crumbling oligarchy? I think so.

This is my simple analysis. If you remove all thoughts of profit and loss, you're left with a simple  falling wedge  and a bright, innovative future. We may very well see new lows into October while this pattern completes. However, I do not believe in an extended future for this bear market.

 BTC 0.00%  is bouncing but we certainly have to be aware of the weakness via the  volume  and inability to close over resistance levels. Key test at 7k for this count as can cant break into 1 wave territory on a wave 3. On the downside we have excellent algo target confluence at the 5300 to 5k zone and finally in the 4200 region along with a high  volume  node that I suspect may be the low for  BTC 0.00% . We will likely have a period of accumulation following this low after a good bounce as the whales load up for a large degree 3 wave that will  IMO              be quite incredible to be a part of. Not to mention the dollar and central banks are showing weakness, brexit coming soon and the stock market clearly nearing correction time. Will  BTC 0.00%  be a beneficiary of a crumbling oligarchy? I think so.

This is my simple analysis. If you remove all thoughts of profit and loss, you're left with a simple  falling wedge  and a bright, innovative future. We may very well see new lows into October while this pattern completes. However, I do not believe in an extended future for this bear market.

 BTC 0.22%  is bouncing but we certainly have to be aware of the weakness via the  volume  and inability to close over resistance levels. Key test at 7k for this count as can cant break into 1 wave territory on a wave 3. On the downside we have excellent algo target confluence at the 5300 to 5k zone and finally in the 4200 region along with a high  volume  node that I suspect may be the low for  BTC 0.22% . We will likely have a period of accumulation following this low after a good bounce as the whales load up for a large degree 3 wave that will  IMO 0.27%  be quite incredible to be a part of. Not to mention the dollar and central banks are showing weakness, brexit coming soon and the stock market clearly nearing correction time. Will  BTC 0.22%  be a beneficiary of a crumbling oligarchy? I think so.

This is my simple analysis. If you remove all thoughts of profit and loss, you're left with a simple  falling wedge  and a bright, innovative future. We may very well see new lows into October while this pattern completes. However, I do not believe in an extended future for this bear market.

 BTC 0.23%  is bouncing but we certainly have to be aware of the weakness via the  volume  and inability to close over resistance levels. Key test at 7k for this count as can cant break into 1 wave territory on a wave 3. On the downside we have excellent algo target confluence at the 5300 to 5k zone and finally in the 4200 region along with a high  volume  node that I suspect may be the low for  BTC 0.23% . We will likely have a period of accumulation following this low after a good bounce as the whales load up for a large degree 3 wave that will  IMO 0.27%  be quite incredible to be a part of. Not to mention the dollar and central banks are showing weakness, brexit coming soon and the stock market clearly nearing correction time. Will  BTC 0.23%  be a beneficiary of a crumbling oligarchy? I think so.

This is my simple analysis. If you remove all thoughts of profit and loss, you're left with a simple  falling wedge  and a bright, innovative future. We may very well see new lows into October while this pattern completes. However, I do not believe in an extended future for this bear market.

 BTC              is bouncing but we certainly have to be aware of the weakness via the  volume  and inability to close over resistance levels. Key test at 7k for this count as can cant break into 1 wave territory on a wave 3. On the downside we have excellent algo target confluence at the 5300 to 5k zone and finally in the 4200 region along with a high  volume  node that I suspect may be the low for  BTC             . We will likely have a period of accumulation following this low after a good bounce as the whales load up for a large degree 3 wave that will  IMO              be quite incredible to be a part of. Not to mention the dollar and central banks are showing weakness, brexit coming soon and the stock market clearly nearing correction time. Will  BTC              be a beneficiary of a crumbling oligarchy? I think so.

This is my simple analysis. If you remove all thoughts of profit and loss, you're left with a simple  falling wedge  and a bright, innovative future. We may very well see new lows into October while this pattern completes. However, I do not believe in an extended future for this bear market.

 BTC 0.11%  is bouncing but we certainly have to be aware of the weakness via the  volume  and inability to close over resistance levels. Key test at 7k for this count as can cant break into 1 wave territory on a wave 3. On the downside we have excellent algo target confluence at the 5300 to 5k zone and finally in the 4200 region along with a high  volume  node that I suspect may be the low for  BTC 0.11% . We will likely have a period of accumulation following this low after a good bounce as the whales load up for a large degree 3 wave that will  IMO              be quite incredible to be a part of. Not to mention the dollar and central banks are showing weakness, brexit coming soon and the stock market clearly nearing correction time. Will  BTC 0.11%  be a beneficiary of a crumbling oligarchy? I think so.

This is my simple analysis. If you remove all thoughts of profit and loss, you're left with a simple  falling wedge  and a bright, innovative future. We may very well see new lows into October while this pattern completes. However, I do not believe in an extended future for this bear market.

 BTC              is bouncing but we certainly have to be aware of the weakness via the  volume  and inability to close over resistance levels. Key test at 7k for this count as can cant break into 1 wave territory on a wave 3. On the downside we have excellent algo target confluence at the 5300 to 5k zone and finally in the 4200 region along with a high  volume  node that I suspect may be the low for  BTC             . We will likely have a period of accumulation following this low after a good bounce as the whales load up for a large degree 3 wave that will  IMO              be quite incredible to be a part of. Not to mention the dollar and central banks are showing weakness, brexit coming soon and the stock market clearly nearing correction time.

This is my simple analysis. If you remove all thoughts of profit and loss, you're left with a simple  falling wedge  and a bright, innovative future. We may very well see new lows into October while this pattern completes. However, I do not believe in an extended future for this bear market.

 BTC 0.11%  is bouncing but we certainly have to be aware of the weakness via the  volume  and inability to close over resistance levels. Key test at 7k for this count as can cant break into 1 wave territory on a wave 3. On the downside we have excellent algo target confluence at the 5300 to 5k zone and finally in the 4200 region along with a high  volume  node that I suspect may be the low for  BTC 0.11% . We will likely have a period of accumulation following this low after a good bounce as the whales load up for a large degree 3 wave that will  IMO              be quite incredible to be a part of. Not to mention the dollar and central banks are showing weakness, brexit coming soon and the stock market clearly nearing correction time. Will  BTC 0.11%  be a beneficiary of a crumbling oligarchy? I think so.

This is my simple analysis. If you remove all thoughts of profit and loss, you're left with a simple  falling wedge  and a bright, innovative future. We may very well see new lows into October while this pattern completes. However, I do not believe in an extended future for this bear market.

 BTC 0.13%  is bouncing but we certainly have to be aware of the weakness via the  volume  and inability to close over resistance levels. Key test at 7k for this count as can cant break into 1 wave territory on a wave 3. On the downside we have excellent algo target confluence at the 5300 to 5k zone and finally in the 4200 region along with a high  volume  node that I suspect may be the low for  BTC 0.13% . We will likely have a period of accumulation following this low after a good bounce as the whales load up for a large degree 3 wave that will  IMO              be quite incredible to be a part of. Not to mention the dollar and central banks are showing weakness, brexit coming soon and the stock market clearly nearing correction time. Will  BTC 0.13%  be a beneficiary of a crumbling oligarchy? I think so.

BTC- Tripple  Doji  on the 4 hour  indicating an extended move down. 
This can  move down to  6240.






2 hours ago





Comment:
					The  extended move down is cancelled only if BTC remains above the support at 6458.

Every big/decent bounce was preceded by green buy  volume . We just had one recently after a damn 2 long months. Would be great if  ema  crosses too. May the Lord bless y' all crypto nerds. GL

This is my simple analysis. If you remove all thoughts of profit and loss, you're left with a simple  falling wedge  and a bright, innovative future. We may very well see new lows into October while this pattern completes. However, I do not believe in an extended future for this bear market.

 BTC 0.03%  is bouncing but we certainly have to be aware of the weakness via the  volume  and inability to close over resistance levels. Key test at 7k for this count as can cant break into 1 wave territory on a wave 3. On the downside we have excellent algo target confluence at the 5300 to 5k zone and finally in the 4200 region along with a high  volume  node that I suspect may be the low for  BTC 0.03% . We will likely have a period of accumulation following this low after a good bounce as the whales load up for a large degree 3 wave that will  IMO 0.27%  be quite incredible to be a part of. Not to mention the dollar and central banks are showing weakness, brexit coming soon and the stock market clearly nearing correction time. Will  BTC 0.03%  be a beneficiary of a crumbling oligarchy? I think so.
