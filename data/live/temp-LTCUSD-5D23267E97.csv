Here is a little update. Due to lack of participation, I have not yet published the data in the linked thread. (Litecoin real base price 505 USD, more important than any TA) 
As you can see, although your trading price has changed, but not the base price. Now is the moment why you should ask yourself this question. 

Good luck and happy trading

Comment:
					This could be a possible scenario. The scenario only describes how we get there. People always need pictures to be able to imagine things. But we all invest money, most of us but without taking a close look at the fundamentals. 

Only if you have rated an investment, then it is worth making a chart. Therefore, the evaluation of an investment is strongly related to the technical analysis and the potential.
