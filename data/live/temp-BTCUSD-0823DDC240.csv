1530700185.0,VaidoVeek,BITCOIN DANCE BETWEEN THE BULLISH AND BEARISH AREAS,"
Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC -0.07%  shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade! 

Don't forget to LIKE, unless You don't appreciate it! ;) 
Thank You very much!

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC              as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC             . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC              needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

This indicator is based on statistical analysis of the data and provides information about possible maximum/minimum values of the day (just right after the day has started) with certain probabilities.  
What does this information give to the trader? Actually, a lot. First of all, trading signals. For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability.

 BTC              Chart Looks Pretty good to me. 
We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC              breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy. 
Good Luck guys.

Seemingly  BTC -0.14%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC -0.14%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC -0.14%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves. 

RSI  and  MACD  are also confirming some better days.

 BTCUSD -0.14%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

 BTC              Chart Looks Pretty good to me. 
We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC              breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy. 
Good Luck guys.

Seemingly  BTC -0.08%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC -0.08%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC -0.08%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves. 

RSI  and  MACD  are also confirming some better days.

 BTCUSD -0.08%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC -0.07%  shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade! 

Don't forget to LIKE, unless You don't appreciate it! ;)

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC              as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC             . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC              needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

 BTC -0.07%  Chart Looks Pretty good to me. 
We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC -0.07%  breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy. 
Good Luck guys.

Seemingly  BTC -0.07%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC -0.07%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC -0.07%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves. 

RSI  and  MACD  are also confirming some better days.

 BTCUSD -0.07%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC -0.07%  shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade! 

Don't forget to LIKE, unless You don't appreciate it! ;) 
Thank You very much!

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC -0.07%  as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC -0.07% . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC -0.07%  needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC -0.07%  shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade! 

Don't forget to LIKE, unless You don't appreciate it! ;) 
Thank You very much!

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC -0.07%  as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC -0.07% . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC -0.07%  needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

What does this information give to the trader? Actually, a lot. First of all, trading signals. For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability.

 BTC -0.07%  Chart Looks Pretty good to me. 
We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC -0.07%  breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy. 
Good Luck guys.

Seemingly  BTC -0.07%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC -0.07%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC -0.07%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves. 

RSI  and  MACD  are also confirming some better days.

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

 BTC -0.07%  Chart Looks Pretty good to me. 
We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC -0.07%  breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy. 
Good Luck guys.

Seemingly  BTC -0.07%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC -0.07%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC -0.07%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves. 

RSI  and  MACD  are also confirming some better days.

 BTCUSD -0.07%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC -0.07%  shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade! 

Don't forget to LIKE, unless You don't appreciate it! ;) 
Thank You very much!

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC              as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC             . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC              needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

 BTC -0.14%  Chart Looks Pretty good to me. 
We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC -0.14%  breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy. 
Good Luck guys.

Seemingly  BTC -0.14%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC -0.14%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC -0.14%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves. 

RSI  and  MACD  are also confirming some better days.

 BTCUSD -0.14%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC -0.14%  shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade! 

Don't forget to LIKE, unless You don't appreciate it! ;) 
Thank You very much!

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC              as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC             . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC              needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

This indicator is based on statistical analysis of the data and provides information about possible maximum/minimum values of the day (just right after the day has started) with certain probabilities.  
What does this information give to the trader? Actually, a lot. First of all, trading signals. For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability.

 BTCUSD -0.14%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC -0.14%  shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade! 

Don't forget to LIKE, unless You don't appreciate it! ;) 
Thank You very much!

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC              as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC             . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC              needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC              breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy.

Seemingly  BTC -0.13%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC -0.13%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC -0.13%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$

The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC -0.10%  needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

Here we publish signals of the indicator called “Ranger”. It was developed by our experts for intraday trading purposes.  
This indicator is based on statistical analysis of the data and provides information about possible maximum/minimum values of the day (just right after the day has started) with certain probabilities.  
What does this information give to the trader? Actually, a lot. First of all, trading signals. For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability. So, you can open a position opposite to the current movement, knowing in advance that it will be profitable with certain probability.

 BTC -0.07%  Chart Looks Pretty good to me. 
We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC -0.07%  breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy. 
Good Luck guys.

Seemingly  BTC -0.07%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC -0.07%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC -0.07%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves. 

RSI  and  MACD  are also confirming some better days.

 BTCUSD 0.01%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC 0.03%  shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade! 

Don't forget to LIKE, unless You don't appreciate it! ;) 
Thank You very much!

 BTC              Chart Looks Pretty good to me. 
We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC              breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy. 
Good Luck guys.

Seemingly  BTC -0.01%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC -0.01%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC -0.01%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves. 

RSI  and  MACD  are also confirming some better days.

 BTCUSD -0.01%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC -0.01%  shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade! 

Don't forget to LIKE, unless You don't appreciate it! ;) 
Thank You very much!

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC -0.01%  as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC -0.01% . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC -0.01%  needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC -0.01%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves. 

RSI  and  MACD  are also confirming some better days.

 BTCUSD -0.01%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC -0.01%  shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade!

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC -0.01%  as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC -0.01% . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC -0.01%  needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability.

 BTC -0.01%  Chart Looks Pretty good to me. 
We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC -0.01%  breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy.

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC              as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC             . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC              needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

 BTC -0.01%  Chart Looks Pretty good to me. 
We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC -0.01%  breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy. 
Good Luck guys.

Seemingly  BTC -0.01%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC -0.01%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC -0.01%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves. 

RSI  and  MACD  are also confirming some better days.

 BTCUSD -0.01%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC -0.01%  shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade! 

Don't forget to LIKE, unless You don't appreciate it! ;) 
Thank You very much!

 BTC -0.01%  Chart Looks Pretty good to me. 
We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC -0.01%  breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy. 
Good Luck guys.

Seemingly  BTC -0.01%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC -0.01%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC -0.01%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves. 

RSI  and  MACD  are also confirming some better days.

 BTCUSD -0.01%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC -0.01%  shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade! 

Don't forget to LIKE, unless You don't appreciate it! ;) 
Thank You very much!

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC -0.01%  as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC -0.01% . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC -0.01%  needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

Seemingly  BTC 0.03%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC 0.03%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC 0.03%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves.

 BTCUSD 0.03%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC              shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade! 

Don't forget to LIKE, unless You don't appreciate it! ;)

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC              as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC             . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC              needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

 BTC 0.03%  Chart Looks Pretty good to me. 
We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC 0.03%  breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy.

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC 0.04%  as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC 0.04% . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC 0.04%  needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

 BTC 0.05%  Chart Looks Pretty good to me. 
We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC 0.05%  breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy. 
Good Luck guys.

Seemingly  BTC 0.05%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC 0.05%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC 0.05%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves. 

RSI  and  MACD  are also confirming some better days.

 BTCUSD 0.05%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC 0.05%  shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade!

 BTC 0.22%  Chart Looks Pretty good to me. 
We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC 0.22%  breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy. 
Good Luck guys.

Seemingly  BTC 0.12%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC 0.12%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC 0.12%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves. 

RSI  and  MACD  are also confirming some better days.

 BTCUSD 0.12%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC 0.12%  shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade! 

Don't forget to LIKE, unless You don't appreciate it! ;) 
Thank You very much!

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC 0.12%  as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC 0.12% . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC 0.12%  needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

Seemingly  BTC 0.12%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC 0.12%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC 0.12%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves. 

RSI  and  MACD  are also confirming some better days.

 BTCUSD 0.12%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC 0.16%  shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade! 

Don't forget to LIKE, unless You don't appreciate it! ;) 
Thank You very much!

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC 0.16%  as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC 0.16% . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC 0.16%  needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC              breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy.

At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade!

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC 0.18%  as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC 0.18% . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC 0.18%  needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

This indicator is based on statistical analysis of the data and provides information about possible maximum/minimum values of the day (just right after the day has started) with certain probabilities.  
What does this information give to the trader? Actually, a lot. First of all, trading signals. For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability.

 BTC 0.19%  Chart Looks Pretty good to me. 
We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC 0.19%  breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy. 
Good Luck guys.

Seemingly  BTC 0.18%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC 0.18%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC 0.18%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves. 

RSI  and  MACD  are also confirming some better days.

 BTCUSD 0.19%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC 0.19%  shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!

Here we publish signals of the indicator called “Ranger”. It was developed by our experts for intraday trading purposes.  
This indicator is based on statistical analysis of the data and provides information about possible maximum/minimum values of the day (just right after the day has started) with certain probabilities.  
What does this information give to the trader? Actually, a lot. First of all, trading signals. For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability. So, you can open a position opposite to the current movement, knowing in advance that it will be profitable with certain probability.

 BTC 0.22%  Chart Looks Pretty good to me. 
We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC 0.22%  breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy. 
Good Luck guys.

Seemingly  BTC 0.25%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC 0.25%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC 0.25%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves. 

RSI  and  MACD  are also confirming some better days.

 BTCUSD 0.25%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC 0.25%  shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade! 

Don't forget to LIKE, unless You don't appreciate it! ;) 
Thank You very much!

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC 0.25%  as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC 0.25% . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC 0.25%  needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC 0.25%  breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy. 
Good Luck guys.

Seemingly  BTC 0.25%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC 0.25%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC 0.25%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves. 

RSI  and  MACD  are also confirming some better days.

 BTCUSD 0.25%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC 0.25%  shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade! 

Don't forget to LIKE, unless You don't appreciate it! ;) 
Thank You very much!

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC 0.25%  as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC 0.25% . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC 0.25%  needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade!

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC 0.26%  as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC 0.26% . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC 0.26%  needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

This indicator is based on statistical analysis of the data and provides information about possible maximum/minimum values of the day (just right after the day has started) with certain probabilities.  
What does this information give to the trader? Actually, a lot. First of all, trading signals. For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability.

 BTC 0.27%  Chart Looks Pretty good to me. 
We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC 0.27%  breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy. 
Good Luck guys.

Seemingly  BTC 0.26%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC 0.26%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC 0.26%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves. 

RSI  and  MACD  are also confirming some better days.

 BTCUSD 0.26%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC 0.27%  shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100

Here we publish signals of the indicator called “Ranger”. It was developed by our experts for intraday trading purposes.  
This indicator is based on statistical analysis of the data and provides information about possible maximum/minimum values of the day (just right after the day has started) with certain probabilities.  
What does this information give to the trader? Actually, a lot. First of all, trading signals. For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability. So, you can open a position opposite to the current movement, knowing in advance that it will be profitable with certain probability.

 BTC 0.19%  Chart Looks Pretty good to me. 
We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC 0.19%  breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy. 
Good Luck guys.

Seemingly  BTC 0.20%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC 0.20%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC 0.20%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves. 

RSI  and  MACD  are also confirming some better days.

 BTCUSD 0.20%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC              shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade! 

Don't forget to LIKE, unless You don't appreciate it! ;) 
Thank You very much!

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC              as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC             . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC              needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

 BTC              Chart Looks Pretty good to me. 
We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC              breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy. 
Good Luck guys.

Seemingly  BTC 0.13%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC 0.13%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC 0.13%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves.

 BTCUSD 0.13%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC 0.13%  shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade! 

Don't forget to LIKE, unless You don't appreciate it! ;) 
Thank You very much!

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC              as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC             . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC              needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade! 

Don't forget to LIKE, unless You don't appreciate it! ;) 
Thank You very much!

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC 0.17%  as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC 0.17% . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC 0.17%  needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

In the previous idea of June 30th, I assumed that before we have not local turnaround, but a bear formation, in which from 6500 we must return to the 5850 and maybe upgrade the minimum. However, the price has arrived in a different way, but within the limits of the bear formation. 
At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

Here we publish signals of the indicator called “Ranger”. It was developed by our experts for intraday trading purposes.  
This indicator is based on statistical analysis of the data and provides information about possible maximum/minimum values of the day (just right after the day has started) with certain probabilities.  
What does this information give to the trader? Actually, a lot. First of all, trading signals. For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability.

 BTC 0.17%  Chart Looks Pretty good to me. 
We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC 0.17%  breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy.

Seemingly  BTC 0.17%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC 0.17%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC 0.17%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves. 

RSI  and  MACD  are also confirming some better days.

 BTCUSD 0.16%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

At the moment, the  trend line  is broken, which indicates the weakness of the buyers. Next I see 2 scenarios: 
1. The price goes to the zone 6600-6800 - and thence to 5850-6000 
2. The price immediately returns to the incoming channel and goes to 5850-6000 
With this bear formation, there are exceptions when the price push up. However, only after another test 5850-6000.

Here we publish signals of the indicator called “Ranger”. It was developed by our experts for intraday trading purposes.  
This indicator is based on statistical analysis of the data and provides information about possible maximum/minimum values of the day (just right after the day has started) with certain probabilities.  
What does this information give to the trader? Actually, a lot. First of all, trading signals. For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability.

 BTC 0.14%  Chart Looks Pretty good to me. 
We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC 0.14%  breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy. 
Good Luck guys.

Seemingly  BTC 0.14%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC 0.14%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC 0.14%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves. 

RSI  and  MACD  are also confirming some better days.

 BTCUSD 0.14%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).

Hello, my dear followers and the other TV users! 
At first, I will try to give You a little bit bigger picture and in the update section, I will continue with the shorter timeframes! 
At the moment  BTC              shows us some  bullish  signs and some  bearish  signs and we step between those important levels. 

Let's start from  bearish  signs: 
1. We had yesterday two types of ""Rising Wedges"" and also two types of ""Bearish Flags"" - we break all those patterns downwards 
2. We break back below the minor  trendline  since 14.05.2018 
3. We break down from the major continuation pattern ""Rising Wedge"" 
4. The trend is Your friend and the trend is down at the moment! 

Now the  bullish  signs: 
1. We have an uptrend since 24.06  
2. Yesterday's candle closes above the round number which is $6500 
3. The bounce comes from $6414 where met decent  support/resistance  area,  Fibonacci retracement  62% and the bounce was supported also with EMA100 
4. Also, there was a possibility that this bounce from a new HL 
5. At the moment the price is back above the  trendline  and above the $6500 

Summary: 
At the moment there are mixed signs! IF the yesterday's candle would be closed below the $6500 then it would be also much easier! But this bounce and possible HL makes me a little bit cautious about shorting - need more criteria (like yesterday)! 
But in the other hand, I just don't see the buyers power at the moment to push this price up and the zone where they have to push this through, this level is very strong!  
Only long candles can beat this levels and where we get those candles -  we get those candles then when we see a very big volume! 

Wait for some updates and chart patterns from the lower timeframes! 
Let's seek and FIND nice confirmation boxes where we can enter the trade! 

Don't forget to LIKE, unless You don't appreciate it! ;) 
Thank You very much!

Hello fellow cryptoheads, 
There is no mystery in what is coming to  BTC              as you can see. Make no mistake folks this is the most important move for  BTC             . The massive  ascending triangle  would normally break down near apex, and that is 75% chance at the moment. The drop would probably retest the lows zone again and put to rest the triple bottom scenario.  The other 25% probability would have a rally pierce the triangle to the upside. As long as price remains above the EMAs it is still chance.  For some reason I am  bullish  even though the technicals are saying  bearish . I have pinpointed $6750 is the price  BTC              needs to break for confirmation of bull reversal. Keep an eye on it.

 BTC 0.14%  Chart Looks Pretty good to me. 
We broke the Long uptrend (yellow line) 
Now we have 3 big resistances. 6873, 9991, 11761 
But it may bounce at 7630 back to 6900 
If you look at the  RSI , it looks good now. So I am optimistic to break the first resistance. 
But be careful. If  BTC 0.14%  breaks under the yellow support line it could fall heavy. 
Good Luck guys.

Seemingly  BTC 0.14%  has finished the very long depression and broke out of the ""smaller"" negative trend channel. 
To confirm this new life it shouldn´t fall back into it. 
If  BTC 0.14%  continues its new trend, then we have seen the low at 5.755$ - and this low could also be the endpoint of a long correction cycle. 
The dayly candle from june 29 is enclosing that form the day before - that´s a  bullish  sign and is confirming the new trend ( bullish engulfing ). 

The above mentioned in mind I expect  BTC 0.14%  to start a new rally and this should lead to following levels: 
Level 1: a swing  trend line  at about 7.370$ 
Level 2: the upper limit of the bigger negative trend channel - crossing with another swing  trend line  at 7.960$ 

Each level can be a turning point - in EW: 3 / 5 motive waves; we´re actually in motive wave 1 - in between (2 / 4) two corrective waves. 

RSI  and  MACD  are also confirming some better days.

 BTCUSD 0.14%  is actually hitting a major  support level  which have been acting as a major area where bulls and bears usually battle for autority. The overall trend is  bearish  and it will not be suprising to see the bears win. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies have been gaining momentum this new month. Last week, the market experienced both a solid increase in trade  volume  as well as two strong days for value increase. In response, investors have headed into the month of July with a greater degree of optimism about the crypto space than they have had in a long time. 
In short term, the asset is ranging. A  bullish trend  might be confirmed if price breaks the range and closes above the 200 SMA. Aggressive traders may short if price closes just below the 100  SMA  as globally we are in a  bearish  market (follow the trend).
