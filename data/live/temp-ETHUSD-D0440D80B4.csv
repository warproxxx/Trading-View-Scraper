1530532167.0,Trade24Fx,Kenji signals: sell ETHUSD,"
Today, the indicator ""Kenji"" on the daily  ETHUSD 3.61%  chart generated a sell signal.  

Let's give some explanations on this signal. This is the ordinary signal to open the trade with a basic  volume  .  

According to the indicator, the price of  ETHUSD 3.61%  is currently in the active downtrend phase (the area between the fast and slow average is colored red). At the same time, current prices entered the sales zone, which led to the formation of a ""sell"" signal. This short position remains relevant until either the market conditions change (for example, the downtrend changes to flat or uptrend), or a signal to close it appears (a red cross indicating a strong divergence between the price and average values).  

Recall, work in a trend is one of the most comfortable and potentially successful trading options.  

For reference:  

The ""Kenji"" indicator is a brand new look at the average analysis. The main problem of most trading strategies and indicators based on the average analysis is a number of false signals in the case of flat and trend reverse (for example, frequent crossings of the averages, frequent changes in the direction of the averages, etc.). As a result, averages analysis cannot show its real power and effectiveness.  
The Kenji indicator using a unique algorithm avoids the most common average analysis traps and significantly improves the quality of signals by determining the current state of the market (using the color indication ""Kenji"" shows the current state of the market: red color - downtrend, blue - uptrend, green - flat).  
It generates signals for comfortable trading in a local trend. The indicator provides information on both the timing position opening and the moments of profit taking. It also helps to determine the level of aggressiveness of a signal. This makes the ""Kenji"" indicator a very useful tool both for novice and experienced traders.

ETH does not have a clear 4 hour equilibrium pattern like  BTC              currently does, but it is similar.  
We will look for  BTC              to give us a break in the near future which will likely dictate the direction for ETH.  
Bulls must see the continuation we have lacked for 6+ weeks to try and change the daily trend.  
This is still healthy consolidation at this point but a bear break will have us heading back down to recent lows, and will deflate bulls.  
Clear support at low of consolidation to use as a potential stop for bulls, and multiple clear resistances for the bears to use with the lower highs.

ETH/USD upside movement was paused by the 150% line and now is trading in the red. It was expected to reach the upside line of the  Falling Wedge  pattern. It could still reach it after the yesterday's indecision. Only a valid breakout from the potential  Falling Wedge  will signal an important rebound because this could be only a temporary rebound. However, a further drop will be confirmed only after a valid breakdown below the 412 level.

This one is neutral, it depends on the market, I could see it bounces if BTC/USD bounces, but I doubt ETH can rally, I'm  bearish  on the  ETH/BTC              value.

1530513354.0,fondiea,No strong resistance are up to 400.00,"
It was pushed back near the double zero of 400.00 on the weekend, but it was stopped again by the horizontal line (461.80 in my chart). 
Also, in July, the position of the MPP changed, so that there was no strong resistance up to 400.00. 

I am watching it as a downtrend now, so I'd like to put a short as a set sequence. 


<< tactics >> 
1) Horizontal line 461.80 functioned as a resistance line 
short. 
The first limit is above double zero 400.00. 
The second limit is above WePP (S2) 374.38. 

2) It is doubtful whether the horizontal line 461.80 functions as a resistance line 
Because it sees as downtrend, Long does not think. I will observe. 



I would be grateful if you like it idea,give me follow or agrees!
