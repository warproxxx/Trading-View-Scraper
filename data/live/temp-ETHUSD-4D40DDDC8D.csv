 Ethereum 2.27%  short term is still channeling down the  falling wedge . Yesterday the support line was tested again and held firm. The price bounced back to mid 400's and is going to seek the higher regions of the resistance line. We could have a breakout there, but I would rather see one more downtrend to 370-360 region, which should provide a solid support. As the trading range gets tighter the margin of profit and reward/loss ratio diminishes significantly. The closer to the apex the price gets, there are not a lot of sellers left because...there is nothing to sell. However, I have been saying this for awhile, I would rather see the price drop as low as 310-300. The turnaround might take some time because there is a tough resistance hanging on top and there are no shortcuts to overcoming that.

Today, there was a rejection in the price around $467, the 78% retracement level, in ETH against the  US Dollar -0.89% .  Ethereum 2.27%  then failed to break that resistance and declined back till $435. Despite the pump in all cryptocurrencies last night, the price is currently in a  bearish  zone, signaled by the light green  trendline . 

If there is a break above the Fib level at $467, then the price could aim to the  trendline , as a next resistance. Only once it closes above it,  Ethereum 2.27%  could become  bullish  again.  

RSI  and OBV show some  bullish  signals, but it is still early to confirm if the uptrend we saw in the past hours will be sustained with enough buying  volume . 

After that price level of $467, the next resistances that ETh may face are $500 and $530, where  POC  lies.

The pump across almost all coins yesterday was a pleasant surprise for those that are hoping for a recovery but there are some serious technical barriers that give me pause.  First, for  ETHUSD 2.27%  we see this pump did not get us to the either the overhead resistance in red, and didn't come anywhere close to the log resistance line in blue.  A look at  BTCUSD 2.22%  will see that the first pump that occured before midnight UTC took  BTCUSD 2.22%  to the normal resistance line, and the second pump had us bumping along the log resistance line 






So technically the  ETHUSD 2.27%  pump wasn't as strong, or we didn't get as much as we could, compared to the  BTC 2.22%  pump.   BTC 2.22%  still sets the tempo for crypto and we see that  BTC 2.22%  is grinding against the falling log resistance line.  The conspiracy theorist in me thinks that the short squeeze was aimed at targeting the relatively high number of shorts, and we will soon see a rare long squeeze to go after the longs, which are at their highest point since early April. 






And all that can happen with  BTCUSD 2.22%  and  ETHUSD 2.27%  staying within the macro pattern they are already following.  I am taking my  ETHUSD 2.27%  trade cues from  BTC 2.22%  and the log resistance line has held strong.  I strongly suspect  BTCUSD 2.22%  will go down and we will see  ETHUSD 2.27%  fall along with it.

 ETHUSD 2.27%  looks very promising as black line is a STRONG SUPPORT LINE. 

Follow the arrow, give importance to upper side of the  wedge  (red lines) 

ETH  FUTURES  is on the way, so ETH will also overperform BTC!
