Since May ETH was in a downtrend. But after the reversal on the end of June an upward trend is already developing. If it can close above the major resistance at 490 USD it may have a probability to perform an  elliott  rally. Both  RSI  and  MACD  showing a positive outcomes in the near future. Besides this some  volume  spike might be needed for the boost. Other than that it would be a good potential entry for those who get this currency less than 500 USD at all. An easy 100% profit is expected in the mid term investing opportunity and plan.
