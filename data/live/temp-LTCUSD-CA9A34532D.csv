1530539602.0,yarr,Litecoin - Recover In Process?,"
The price is moving inside of the  Falling Wedge  pattern which is considered as a reversal pattern. Possible reversal is supported by  Bullish Divergence  which can be spotted on the chart when the price and  RSI  are not following each other but moving opposite directions. Upside potential is maximal while downside potential is minimal - what it means that as the market is starting slowly recover and if it does establish a solid rock bottom here it means upside potential is greater than downside.  

The market is not out of the woods yet and that's why it's important to wait for confirmed signals before opening a new entry. 

The price needs to break out above of $86.7 - $93 levels to signal any bullishness and offers good entry point. Once it manages to break above of the confluence zone and if  volume  starts expanding, then this gives good confirmation for upward movement and that the price is trying to push higher. The measured pattern target is at $131 level and partial profit target is at $105 - $111 that can be found close to the next  resistance level . 

Trading Information: 
Buy: Above $86.7 - $93 
Partial Profit Target: $105 - $111 
Main Profit Target: Around $131
