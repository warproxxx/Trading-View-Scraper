Hello Traders, 

I wanted to post something I found quite interesting and hope that you all do as well. It has to do with  Bitcoins -0.26%  emotional synchronicity within my own life and I do my best to describe it with my Steemit blog. 

Hopefully you all find it interesting and approach the  Bitcoin -0.26%  chart from a different perspective like I have. If you have any insight that might help my case for synchronicity please check out my blog and post a reply.

 Bitcoin -0.26%  chart looks very  bullish  now. We should be able to break 6800$ today  
I think we should expect the rally to 7500-7800

Hello Traders, 

I wanted to post something I found quite interesting and hope that you all do as well. It has to do with  Bitcoins -0.26%  emotional synchronicity within my own life and I do my best to describe it with my Steemit blog. 

Hopefully you all find it interesting and approach the  Bitcoin -0.26%  chart from a different perspective like I have. If you have any insight that might help my case for synchronicity please check out my blog and post a reply.

Hello Traders, 

I wanted to post something I found quite interesting and hope that you all do as well. It has to do with  Bitcoins -0.04%  emotional synchronicity within my own life and I do my best to describe it with my Steemit blog. 

Hopefully you all find it interesting and approach the  Bitcoin -0.04%  chart from a different perspective like I have. If you have any insight that might help my case for synchronicity please check out my blog and post a reply.

 Bitcoin -0.04%  chart looks very  bullish  now. We should be able to break 6800$ today

Hello Traders, 

I wanted to post something I found quite interesting and hope that you all do as well. It has to do with  Bitcoins -0.04%  emotional synchronicity within my own life and I do my best to describe it with my Steemit blog. 

Hopefully you all find it interesting and approach the  Bitcoin -0.04%  chart from a different perspective like I have. If you have any insight that might help my case for synchronicity please check out my blog and post a reply.

Hello Traders, 

I wanted to post something I found quite interesting and hope that you all do as well. It has to do with  Bitcoins -0.04%  emotional synchronicity within my own life and I do my best to describe it with my Steemit blog. 

Hopefully you all find it interesting and approach the  Bitcoin -0.04%  chart from a different perspective like I have. If you have any insight that might help my case for synchronicity please check out my blog and post a reply.

 Bitcoin -0.04%  chart looks very  bullish  now. We should be able to break 6800$ today  
I think we should expect the rally to 7500-7800

Hello Traders, 

I wanted to post something I found quite interesting and hope that you all do as well. It has to do with  Bitcoins -0.13%  emotional synchronicity within my own life and I do my best to describe it with my Steemit blog. 

Hopefully you all find it interesting and approach the  Bitcoin -0.13%  chart from a different perspective like I have. If you have any insight that might help my case for synchronicity please check out my blog and post a reply.

Hello Traders, 

I wanted to post something I found quite interesting and hope that you all do as well. It has to do with  Bitcoins -0.17%  emotional synchronicity within my own life and I do my best to describe it with my Steemit blog. 

Hopefully you all find it interesting and approach the  Bitcoin -0.17%  chart from a different perspective like I have. If you have any insight that might help my case for synchronicity please check out my blog and post a reply.

 Bitcoin -0.17%  chart looks very  bullish  now. We should be able to break 6800$ today  
I think we should expect the rally to 7500-7800

Hello Traders, 

I wanted to post something I found quite interesting and hope that you all do as well. It has to do with  Bitcoins -0.17%  emotional synchronicity within my own life and I do my best to describe it with my Steemit blog. 

Hopefully you all find it interesting and approach the  Bitcoin -0.17%  chart from a different perspective like I have. If you have any insight that might help my case for synchronicity please check out my blog and post a reply.

Hello Traders, 

I wanted to post something I found quite interesting and hope that you all do as well. It has to do with  Bitcoins -0.17%  emotional synchronicity within my own life and I do my best to describe it with my Steemit blog. 

Hopefully you all find it interesting and approach the  Bitcoin -0.17%  chart from a different perspective like I have. If you have any insight that might help my case for synchronicity please check out my blog and post a reply.

Hello Traders, 

I wanted to post something I found quite interesting and hope that you all do as well. It has to do with  Bitcoins -0.21%  emotional synchronicity within my own life and I do my best to describe it with my Steemit blog. 

Hopefully you all find it interesting and approach the  Bitcoin -0.21%  chart from a different perspective like I have. If you have any insight that might help my case for synchronicity please check out my blog and post a reply.

Hello Traders, 

I wanted to post something I found quite interesting and hope that you all do as well. It has to do with  Bitcoins -0.20%  emotional synchronicity within my own life and I do my best to describe it with my Steemit blog. 

Hopefully you all find it interesting and approach the  Bitcoin -0.20%  chart from a different perspective like I have. If you have any insight that might help my case for synchronicity please check out my blog and post a reply. 

Joe

 Bitcoin -0.20%  chart looks very  bullish  now. We should be able to break 6800$ today  
I think we should expect the rally to 7500-7800 

Game on

With a few resistance lines at some higher levels and some bulls we have a good space to see some higher prices in the coming days.

(Badges:  a= 24h/50MA; b= 6h/50MA; boxes are week wide and green box bottom is this week bottom) 

Trading tactics: If we follow the marsh to “a”, then the red box is sell area, if we retrace below red line, look for buy options.  
NB!( if we will brake green box bottom and close below it; then ….. sell, sell, sell)

what's up trader here is a new analysis for  bitcoin -0.20%  : 
 since 12/06 the price break below  support area  (6600) and make a new bottom at (5800) after that the price moves up to retest the broken support and successfully closed above it wich gives an idea that the previous break out was fake ( bear trap ) 
now  btc -0.20%  showing signs of reversal pattern ( h@s ) the price touch neckline and what expected ( the price needs to go down to form the right shoulder) if the pattern complete we will confirm the end down trend and wave 4 and  bitcoin -0.20%  will start a new bull run  
be careful and good luck

Monthly chart looks like we are still bulish on  Bitcoin -0.20% . 21  EMA  which is critical for many trader is not broken and there is huge support around $5700. If we break resistance at $6800 there can be another huge bullrun ahead.
