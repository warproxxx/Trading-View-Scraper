The title suggests a rocketing movement of the token ETH. And in the long run it´s quite possible. 

What are the conditions for this projection? 

1. ETH has ended the long decline and entered a new motive wave 
2. The chart patterns (trend channel and swing  trend lines ) have to be broken up - of course some intermediate correction have to be taken as normal 
3. the fib retracements are resistance lines (38,2% / 50% and 61.8% seem to be stronger than the others) - so once they´re broken they consist as support  
4. beyond 992$ the air becomes thinner but the resistances won´t be so strong as before 
5. with higher prices the momentum gains strength -  volume  will come back 
6.  Ethereum 0.75%  is reaching a new  ATH -1.03% 

As mentioned at point 2 - some intermediate correction are normal. But none of them should stop the  bullish trend . 
Ethereum 0.75%  has proven its use case and is widely accepted - even when some problems occure from time to time. It´ll has to change from PoW to  PoS -1.41%  (casper-protocol) and solve the problem with the scalability. And no one knows what happens when all ICO´s based on  Ethereum 0.75%  begin to trade with their own tokens (and not the ETH).  
I´m conviced that Vitalik Buterin (and the other developers) will find new role models and improvements for  Ethereum 0.75% .
