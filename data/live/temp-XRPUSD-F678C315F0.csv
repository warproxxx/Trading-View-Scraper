Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.448 to $ 0.50. 
2. The XRPUSD rate will take a lateral movement until the end of the day. 
An alternative scenario:

1530515182.0,InvestingScope,Recurring consolidation before another Channel Down. Short.,"
As seen on the chart, Ripple entered again a  Rectangle  on 4H (neutral  RSI ,  STOCH ,  CCI , Highs/Lows), on a recurring Channel Down/  Rectangle  pattern sequence within the dominant 1D Channel Down ( RSI  = 35.326,  MACD  = -0.041, Highs/Lows = -0.0113, B/BP = -0.0444). The price is still trading above the 1D Channel Down median (red dotted line), which technically makes the downtrend less aggressive on the longer term. This is an indication of a possible slowdown on XRP, but not before it reaches our target set: 0.4000 and 0.35277.
