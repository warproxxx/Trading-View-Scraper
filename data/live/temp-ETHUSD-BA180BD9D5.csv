ETH has lost -9.32% Since Monday opening and accumulates -28.5% in June, the  bearish trend  continues as the bears are putting lower minimums in the chart. The price is trying to cross the  Pivot  S1 in $ 410 and received some difficult there, now is sitting around $ 411 and continues to move down into the  bearish channel  on this 4-H chart. A breakout of  Pivot  S1 will probably send the price to the  Pivot  S2, to the important level of $ 400.

Indicators based on channels, bands and  envelopes  are designed to encompass most price action. Therefore, moves above or below the  envelopes  warrant attention. Trends often start with strong moves in one direction or another. A surge above the upper  envelope  shows extraordinary strength, while a plunge below the lower  envelope  shows extraordinary weakness. Such strong moves can signal the end of one trend and the beginning of another. 

With a moving average as its foundation,  Moving Average Envelopes  are a natural trend following indicator. As with moving averages, the  envelopes  will lag price action. The direction of the moving average dictates the direction of the channel. In general, a downtrend is present when the channel moves lower, while an uptrend exists when the channel moves higher. The trend is flat when the channel moves sideways. 

Sometimes a strong trend does not take hold after an  envelope  break and prices move into a trading range. Such trading ranges are marked by a relatively flat moving average. The  envelopes  can then be used to identify overbought and oversold levels for trading purposes. A move above the upper  envelope  denotes an overbought situation, while a move below the lower  envelope  marks an oversold condition
