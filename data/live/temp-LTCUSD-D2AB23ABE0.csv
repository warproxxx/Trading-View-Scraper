LTC didn't break thru the 61.8%,  so is this just the start of the next wave down or are we ready to break out?

Log Scale will give you a little different perspective, always worth checking

Traders, 

This is a similar pattern with  BTCUSD -0.52% , even though LTC has made a new low on weekly chart. 
Check the left side, you will see a lower low is also possible for the same reversal pattern.

Our predictive linguistics analysis bot which aggregates data from over 15,000 Twitter accounts and other input shows there is going to be a large increase in sentiment over the next 60 days reaching December 2017 levels of euphoria. (Coinbase Custody?) 

It shows a relatively large decline in sentiment around mid-september towards the end of the month. (another Hack?) 

Towards the end of this year, our data shows an increase in sentiment an order of magnitude larger than where we are today. (Massive Bull?) 

The aggregator is open-source, you can run it with predefined keywords and existing data-sets. We mainly use it for Litecoin as it is a well established coin less subject to noise.
