1530683777.0,OctaFX_Official,ETHEREUM ONLY BULLISH ABOVE $450,"
 Ethereum             , the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation has fallen back towards the $440  support level , after failing to move above the key $478  resistance level . 

Ethereum              had staged a strong recovery from the $395 level, clawing back close to twenty percent of its value.  ETHUSD              bulls will try to move price above the $450 level, while sellers will target below the $440  support level . 

The  ETHUSD              pair is only intraday  bullish  while trading above the $450 level, further upside towards $478 and $498 remains possible. 

If the  ETHUSD              pair moves below the $440 level, price may correct back towards the $424 and $408 support levels.

1530680776.0,CryptoComes,"ETH/USD Corrects, But Looks Promising","
 Ethereum              stopped its uptrend on Tuesday as the price failed to work another  bullish Flag . ETH/USD loses more than four percent in the past 24 hours but still looks  bullish  as we think this decline is nothing more than a simple downside correction to the previous uptrend.  

Ethereum              declined on Tuesday-Wednesday and reached the  support area  at $453.29. The currency pair formed a  bullish Hammer candlestick  pattern right on its support line with a fake breakout, meaning  Ethereum              is ready to burst upwards again. 
If this works and buyers are successful,  Ethereum              will be able to reach at least $473.39  resistance area . We think that this target is enough for Wednesday. However, if buyers gain momentum, they will be able to drive the currency pair even higher. 
This is the main scenario for today, but we should not forget about bears. They are also able to develop this downside correction even deeper. The price is likely to reach the next  support area  at $431.42 in this case.
