Green boxes are buying areas that I would be paying attention to, while red ones are where I would be looking for short if  volume  and price action matches my thinking. Am not really confident that we will reach lowest green box, but it's something that I always like to keep in my mind, so I wouldn't get into big positions. We in general are still in a downtrend for XMR, so I would be pretty careful.

The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD 0.36%  and  ETHUSD              being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

- broke major support line at $150 (when  BTC 0.39%  -0.20% broke $7000)

- highest  volume  price nodes on Bitfinex: $50, $100, $120, $165

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days.

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

- Monero (XMR/USD) still sitting far below its 200-day  SMA 
- daily  RSI  at all-time low (oversold!) 
- broke major support line at $150 (when  BTC              -0.20% broke $7000) 
- currently finding support around $120 (high  volume  node) 
- highest  volume  price nodes on Bitfinex: $50, $100, $120, $165 
- likely trading range for the next few weeks: $100 - $150 (depends on  BTC              -0.20% ) 
- lots of Monero FUD in circulation (mining malware, hard forks, exchange delistings, etc) 
- very  bullish  on XMR long-term, but currently flat until BTC's next bullrun...

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Green boxes are buying areas that I would be paying attention to, while red ones are where I would be looking for short if  volume  and price action matches my thinking. Am not really confident that we will reach lowest green box, but it's something that I always like to keep in my mind, so I wouldn't get into big positions. We in general are still in a downtrend for XMR, so I would be pretty careful.

The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD              and  ETHUSD              being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days.

Green boxes are buying areas that I would be paying attention to, while red ones are where I would be looking for short if  volume  and price action matches my thinking. Am not really confident that we will reach lowest green box, but it's something that I always like to keep in my mind, so I wouldn't get into big positions.

The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD 0.42%  and  ETHUSD 0.82%  being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

- daily  RSI  at all-time low (oversold!) 
- broke major support line at $150 (when  BTC 0.36%  -0.20% broke $7000)

- highest  volume  price nodes on Bitfinex: $50, $100, $120, $165

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

- Monero (XMR/USD) still sitting far below its 200-day  SMA 
- daily  RSI  at all-time low (oversold!) 
- broke major support line at $150 (when  BTC 0.29%  -0.20% broke $7000) 
- currently finding support around $120 (high  volume  node) 
- highest  volume  price nodes on Bitfinex: $50, $100, $120, $165 
- likely trading range for the next few weeks: $100 - $150 (depends on  BTC 0.29%  -0.20% )

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Price is now in the middle between  support and resistance  areas. 
If price rallies up to the $150 resistance, we can expect a reaction and a possible drop.

buy always above 120 usd

Green boxes are buying areas that I would be paying attention to, while red ones are where I would be looking for short if  volume  and price action matches my thinking. Am not really confident that we will reach lowest green box, but it's something that I always like to keep in my mind, so I wouldn't get into big positions. We in general are still in a downtrend for XMR, so I would be pretty careful.

The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD 0.32%  and  ETHUSD 0.86%  being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Monero (XMRUSD) made a recovery on Thursday after dropping for the past week. 

Price is now in the middle between  support and resistance  areas. 
If price rallies up to the $150 resistance, we can expect a reaction and a possible drop. 
If price continues its decline, we can expect a reaction from the $100  support area .

Green boxes are buying areas that I would be paying attention to, while red ones are where I would be looking for short if  volume  and price action matches my thinking. Am not really confident that we will reach lowest green box, but it's something that I always like to keep in my mind, so I wouldn't get into big positions. We in general are still in a downtrend for XMR, so I would be pretty careful.

The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD 0.31%  and  ETHUSD              being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

- daily  RSI  at all-time low (oversold!) 
- broke major support line at $150 (when  BTC 0.31%  -0.20% broke $7000) 
- currently finding support around $120 (high  volume  node) 
- highest  volume  price nodes on Bitfinex: $50, $100, $120, $165 
- likely trading range for the next few weeks: $100 - $150 (depends on  BTC 0.31%  -0.20% ) 
- lots of Monero FUD in circulation (mining malware, hard forks, exchange delistings, etc) 
- very  bullish  on XMR long-term, but currently flat until BTC's next bullrun...

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

- Monero (XMR/USD) still sitting far below its 200-day  SMA 
- daily  RSI  at all-time low (oversold!) 
- broke major support line at $150 (when  BTC 0.32%  -0.20% broke $7000) 
- currently finding support around $120 (high  volume  node) 
- highest  volume  price nodes on Bitfinex: $50, $100, $120, $165 
- likely trading range for the next few weeks: $100 - $150 (depends on  BTC 0.32%  -0.20% ) 
- lots of Monero FUD in circulation (mining malware, hard forks, exchange delistings, etc) 
- very  bullish  on XMR long-term, but currently flat until BTC's next bullrun...

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Green boxes are buying areas that I would be paying attention to, while red ones are where I would be looking for short if  volume  and price action matches my thinking. Am not really confident that we will reach lowest green box, but it's something that I always like to keep in my mind, so I wouldn't get into big positions. We in general are still in a downtrend for XMR, so I would be pretty careful.

The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD 0.38%  and  ETHUSD              being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

- Monero (XMR/USD) still sitting far below its 200-day  SMA 
- daily  RSI  at all-time low (oversold!) 
- broke major support line at $150 (when  BTC              -0.20% broke $7000) 
- currently finding support around $120 (high  volume  node) 
- highest  volume  price nodes on Bitfinex: $50, $100, $120, $165 
- likely trading range for the next few weeks: $100 - $150 (depends on  BTC              -0.20% ) 
- lots of Monero FUD in circulation (mining malware, hard forks, exchange delistings, etc) 
- very  bullish  on XMR long-term, but currently flat until BTC's next bullrun...

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days.

Green boxes are buying areas that I would be paying attention to, while red ones are where I would be looking for short if  volume  and price action matches my thinking. Am not really confident that we will reach lowest green box, but it's something that I always like to keep in my mind, so I wouldn't get into big positions. We in general are still in a downtrend for XMR, so I would be pretty careful.

The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD              and  ETHUSD              being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

Green boxes are buying areas that I would be paying attention to, while red ones are where I would be looking for short if  volume  and price action matches my thinking.

The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD 0.45%  and  ETHUSD 0.89%  being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

- daily  RSI  at all-time low (oversold!) 
- broke major support line at $150 (when  BTC 0.45%  -0.20% broke $7000) 
- currently finding support around $120 (high  volume  node) 
- highest  volume  price nodes on Bitfinex: $50, $100, $120, $165 
- likely trading range for the next few weeks: $100 - $150 (depends on  BTC 0.45%  -0.20% ) 
- lots of Monero FUD in circulation (mining malware, hard forks, exchange delistings, etc) 
- very  bullish  on XMR long-term, but currently flat until BTC's next bullrun...

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days.

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

- daily  RSI  at all-time low (oversold!) 
- broke major support line at $150 (when  BTC 0.44%  -0.20% broke $7000)

- highest  volume  price nodes on Bitfinex: $50, $100, $120, $165

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Green boxes are buying areas that I would be paying attention to, while red ones are where I would be looking for short if  volume  and price action matches my thinking. Am not really confident that we will reach lowest green box, but it's something that I always like to keep in my mind, so I wouldn't get into big positions. We in general are still in a downtrend for XMR, so I would be pretty careful.

The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD 0.44%  and  ETHUSD 0.89%  being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Monero (XMRUSD) made a recovery on Thursday after dropping for the past week. 

Price is now in the middle between  support and resistance  areas. 
If price rallies up to the $150 resistance, we can expect a reaction and a possible drop. 
If price continues its decline, we can expect a reaction from the $100  support area .

Green boxes are buying areas that I would be paying attention to, while red ones are where I would be looking for short if  volume  and price action matches my thinking. Am not really confident that we will reach lowest green box, but it's something that I always like to keep in my mind, so I wouldn't get into big positions. We in general are still in a downtrend for XMR, so I would be pretty careful.

The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD              and  ETHUSD              being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

- daily  RSI  at all-time low (oversold!) 
- broke major support line at $150 (when  BTC              -0.20% broke $7000) 
- currently finding support around $120 (high  volume  node) 
- highest  volume  price nodes on Bitfinex: $50, $100, $120, $165 
- likely trading range for the next few weeks: $100 - $150 (depends on  BTC              -0.20% )

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

- Monero (XMR/USD) still sitting far below its 200-day  SMA 
- daily  RSI  at all-time low (oversold!) 
- broke major support line at $150 (when  BTC 0.44%  -0.20% broke $7000) 
- currently finding support around $120 (high  volume  node) 
- highest  volume  price nodes on Bitfinex: $50, $100, $120, $165 
- likely trading range for the next few weeks: $100 - $150 (depends on  BTC 0.44%  -0.20% ) 
- lots of Monero FUD in circulation (mining malware, hard forks, exchange delistings, etc) 
- very  bullish  on XMR long-term, but currently flat until BTC's next bullrun...

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days.

Green boxes are buying areas that I would be paying attention to, while red ones are where I would be looking for short if  volume  and price action matches my thinking. Am not really confident that we will reach lowest green box, but it's something that I always like to keep in my mind, so I wouldn't get into big positions. We in general are still in a downtrend for XMR, so I would be pretty careful.

The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD 0.44%  and  ETHUSD 0.76%  being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

- Monero (XMR/USD) still sitting far below its 200-day  SMA 
- daily  RSI  at all-time low (oversold!) 
- broke major support line at $150 (when  BTC 0.20%  -0.20% broke $7000) 
- currently finding support around $120 (high  volume  node) 
- highest  volume  price nodes on Bitfinex: $50, $100, $120, $165

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days.

Green boxes are buying areas that I would be paying attention to, while red ones are where I would be looking for short if  volume  and price action matches my thinking. Am not really confident that we will reach lowest green box, but it's something that I always like to keep in my mind, so I wouldn't get into big positions. We in general are still in a downtrend for XMR, so I would be pretty careful.

The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD 0.19%  and  ETHUSD 0.44%  being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

Monero (XMRUSD) made a recovery on Thursday after dropping for the past week. 

Price is now in the middle between  support and resistance  areas. 
If price rallies up to the $150 resistance, we can expect a reaction and a possible drop. 
If price continues its decline, we can expect a reaction from the $100  support area . 

Good Luck,

ok momentum turns  bullish , early stage, not confirmed 
risky so if you want to buy try like this 
sell always below 119 usd 
buy always above 120 usd 
it can go down and than again go up 
you might have to buy sell a couple of times 
dont buy ball deep 
i write just what i see, it can be wrong or not time  ll say 
indicators says it can have a reversal some 
but again i say, sell always below 119 dont wait, check Daily 
i prefer tight range coz no confirmation about reversal

Green boxes are buying areas that I would be paying attention to, while red ones are where I would be looking for short if  volume  and price action matches my thinking. Am not really confident that we will reach lowest green box, but it's something that I always like to keep in my mind, so I wouldn't get into big positions. We in general are still in a downtrend for XMR, so I would be pretty careful.

The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD 0.19%  and  ETHUSD              being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

- Monero (XMR/USD) still sitting far below its 200-day  SMA 
- daily  RSI  at all-time low (oversold!) 
- broke major support line at $150 (when  BTC 0.21%  -0.20% broke $7000) 
- currently finding support around $120 (high  volume  node) 
- highest  volume  price nodes on Bitfinex: $50, $100, $120, $165 
- likely trading range for the next few weeks: $100 - $150 (depends on  BTC 0.21%  -0.20% ) 
- lots of Monero FUD in circulation (mining malware, hard forks, exchange delistings, etc) 
- very  bullish  on XMR long-term, but currently flat until BTC's next bullrun...

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days.

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

- Monero (XMR/USD) still sitting far below its 200-day  SMA 
- daily  RSI  at all-time low (oversold!) 
- broke major support line at $150 (when  BTC 0.32%  -0.20% broke $7000) 
- currently finding support around $120 (high  volume  node) 
- highest  volume  price nodes on Bitfinex: $50, $100, $120, $165 
- likely trading range for the next few weeks: $100 - $150 (depends on  BTC 0.32%  -0.20% ) 
- lots of Monero FUD in circulation (mining malware, hard forks, exchange delistings, etc) 
- very  bullish  on XMR long-term, but currently flat until BTC's next bullrun...

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Green boxes are buying areas that I would be paying attention to, while red ones are where I would be looking for short if  volume  and price action matches my thinking. Am not really confident that we will reach lowest green box, but it's something that I always like to keep in my mind, so I wouldn't get into big positions. We in general are still in a downtrend for XMR, so I would be pretty careful.

The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD 0.32%  and  ETHUSD 0.55%  being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

- Monero (XMR/USD) still sitting far below its 200-day  SMA 
- daily  RSI  at all-time low (oversold!) 
- broke major support line at $150 (when  BTC              -0.20% broke $7000) 
- currently finding support around $120 (high  volume  node) 
- highest  volume  price nodes on Bitfinex: $50, $100, $120, $165

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days.

Green boxes are buying areas that I would be paying attention to, while red ones are where I would be looking for short if  volume  and price action matches my thinking. Am not really confident that we will reach lowest green box, but it's something that I always like to keep in my mind, so I wouldn't get into big positions. We in general are still in a downtrend for XMR, so I would be pretty careful.

The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD 0.39%  and  ETHUSD 0.65%  being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD 0.39%  and  ETHUSD 0.79%  being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

- daily  RSI  at all-time low (oversold!) 
- broke major support line at $150 (when  BTC 0.39%  -0.20% broke $7000) 
- currently finding support around $120 (high  volume  node) 
- highest  volume  price nodes on Bitfinex: $50, $100, $120, $165 
- likely trading range for the next few weeks: $100 - $150 (depends on  BTC 0.39%  -0.20% ) 
- lots of Monero FUD in circulation (mining malware, hard forks, exchange delistings, etc) 
- very  bullish  on XMR long-term, but currently flat until BTC's next bullrun...

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

- daily  RSI  at all-time low (oversold!) 
- broke major support line at $150 (when  BTC 0.39%  -0.20% broke $7000)

- highest  volume  price nodes on Bitfinex: $50, $100, $120, $165

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Green boxes are buying areas that I would be paying attention to, while red ones are where I would be looking for short if  volume  and price action matches my thinking. Am not really confident that we will reach lowest green box, but it's something that I always like to keep in my mind, so I wouldn't get into big positions. We in general are still in a downtrend for XMR, so I would be pretty careful.

The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD 0.39%  and  ETHUSD 0.67%  being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Monero (XMRUSD) made a recovery on Thursday after dropping for the past week. 

Price is now in the middle between  support and resistance  areas. 
If price rallies up to the $150 resistance, we can expect a reaction and a possible drop. 
If price continues its decline, we can expect a reaction from the $100  support area . 

Good Luck,

ok momentum turns  bullish , early stage, not confirmed

sell always below 119 usd 
buy always above 120 usd 
it can go down and than again go up 
you might have to buy sell a couple of times 
dont buy ball deep 
i write just what i see, it can be wrong or not time  ll say

Green boxes are buying areas that I would be paying attention to, while red ones are where I would be looking for short if  volume  and price action matches my thinking. Am not really confident that we will reach lowest green box, but it's something that I always like to keep in my mind, so I wouldn't get into big positions. We in general are still in a downtrend for XMR, so I would be pretty careful.

The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD 0.42%  and  ETHUSD 0.67%  being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

- daily  RSI  at all-time low (oversold!) 
- broke major support line at $150 (when  BTC 0.42%  -0.20% broke $7000) 
- currently finding support around $120 (high  volume  node) 
- highest  volume  price nodes on Bitfinex: $50, $100, $120, $165 
- likely trading range for the next few weeks: $100 - $150 (depends on  BTC 0.42%  -0.20% ) 
- lots of Monero FUD in circulation (mining malware, hard forks, exchange delistings, etc) 
- very  bullish  on XMR long-term, but currently flat until BTC's next bullrun...

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

- Monero (XMR/USD) still sitting far below its 200-day  SMA 
- daily  RSI  at all-time low (oversold!) 
- broke major support line at $150 (when  BTC 0.42%  -0.20% broke $7000) 
- currently finding support around $120 (high  volume  node) 
- highest  volume  price nodes on Bitfinex: $50, $100, $120, $165 
- likely trading range for the next few weeks: $100 - $150 (depends on  BTC 0.42%  -0.20% ) 
- lots of Monero FUD in circulation (mining malware, hard forks, exchange delistings, etc) 
- very  bullish  on XMR long-term, but currently flat until BTC's next bullrun...

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Green boxes are buying areas that I would be paying attention to, while red ones are where I would be looking for short if  volume  and price action matches my thinking. Am not really confident that we will reach lowest green box, but it's something that I always like to keep in my mind, so I wouldn't get into big positions. We in general are still in a downtrend for XMR, so I would be pretty careful.

The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD 0.42%  and  ETHUSD 0.67%  being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

- Monero (XMR/USD) still sitting far below its 200-day  SMA 
- daily  RSI  at all-time low (oversold!) 
- broke major support line at $150 (when  BTC 0.43%  -0.20% broke $7000) 
- currently finding support around $120 (high  volume  node) 
- highest  volume  price nodes on Bitfinex: $50, $100, $120, $165 
- likely trading range for the next few weeks: $100 - $150 (depends on  BTC 0.43%  -0.20% ) 
- lots of Monero FUD in circulation (mining malware, hard forks, exchange delistings, etc) 
- very  bullish  on XMR long-term, but currently flat until BTC's next bullrun...

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days.

Monero (XMRUSD) made a recovery on Thursday after dropping for the past week. 

Price is now in the middle between  support and resistance  areas. 
If price rallies up to the $150 resistance, we can expect a reaction and a possible drop. 
If price continues its decline, we can expect a reaction from the $100  support area .

Green boxes are buying areas that I would be paying attention to, while red ones are where I would be looking for short if  volume  and price action matches my thinking. Am not really confident that we will reach lowest green box, but it's something that I always like to keep in my mind, so I wouldn't get into big positions. We in general are still in a downtrend for XMR, so I would be pretty careful.

The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD              and  ETHUSD              being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD 0.46%  and  ETHUSD              being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

- daily  RSI  at all-time low (oversold!) 
- broke major support line at $150 (when  BTC 0.48%  -0.20% broke $7000) 
- currently finding support around $120 (high  volume  node) 
- highest  volume  price nodes on Bitfinex: $50, $100, $120, $165 
- likely trading range for the next few weeks: $100 - $150 (depends on  BTC 0.48%  -0.20% ) 
- lots of Monero FUD in circulation (mining malware, hard forks, exchange delistings, etc)

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days.

Monero has been consistently declining since 24th of April, while moving from $300, down to $105, loosing 65% to the USD. Monero almost reached the strong psychological support at $100, and rejected the mid  trendline  of the  descending channel , that has been rejected cleanly. 

The  RSI  has formed a  bullish divergence  after which XRM/USD broke above the  descending channel , suggesting that the price has reached the bottom or could be very close to it. 

Whether this is a reversal point or not, yet to be seen, but the $100 psychological level could be a very strong support for Monero. Daily spikes below are possible, but while weekly close is above the $100, the reversal probability is there. 

Obviously it could take some time for Monero to reverse and extended consolidation still very likely. But only daily, or even weekly break and close below the $100 support would invalidate the reversal potential and might result in a downtrend continuation.

- Monero (XMR/USD) still sitting far below its 200-day  SMA 
- daily  RSI  at all-time low (oversold!) 
- broke major support line at $150 (when  BTC 0.46%  -0.20% broke $7000) 
- currently finding support around $120 (high  volume  node) 
- highest  volume  price nodes on Bitfinex: $50, $100, $120, $165 
- likely trading range for the next few weeks: $100 - $150 (depends on  BTC 0.46%  -0.20% ) 
- lots of Monero FUD in circulation (mining malware, hard forks, exchange delistings, etc) 
- very  bullish  on XMR long-term, but currently flat until BTC's next bullrun...

The above chart is the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index 

Increase of supply that lead to the most recent decline leads me to think that were are currently testing what may possibly be our last point of supply. Bulls need to hold this range as a break here will result a panic sell off in the market. 

Someone is also doing their best to ""paint the tape"" with a lot of sell pressure coming in the last hour of trading, painting a bear reversal candle yesterday. This suggests to me the CO is in the process of testing this region and there will further tests to come over the next couple of days. 

My bias is neutral for now.

Price is now in the middle between  support and resistance  areas. 
If price rallies up to the $150 resistance, we can expect a reaction and a possible drop. 
If price continues its decline, we can expect a reaction from the $100  support area .

ok momentum turns  bullish , early stage, not confirmed 
risky so if you want to buy try like this 
sell always below 119 usd 
buy always above 120 usd 
it can go down and than again go up 
you might have to buy sell a couple of times 
dont buy ball deep 
i write just what i see, it can be wrong or not time  ll say 
indicators says it can have a reversal some 
but again i say, sell always below 119 dont wait, check Daily

Green boxes are buying areas that I would be paying attention to, while red ones are where I would be looking for short if  volume  and price action matches my thinking. Am not really confident that we will reach lowest green box, but it's something that I always like to keep in my mind, so I wouldn't get into big positions. We in general are still in a downtrend for XMR, so I would be pretty careful.

1530027285.0,This_Guhy,XMRUSD Time to Strap In,"
The 2D chart is pretty non-standard, but in these troubling times for  BTCUSD 0.46%  and  ETHUSD 0.67%  being rather  bearish  picking a coin to go long on requires, for me, some extra confidence.  And we see that the 2D  MACD bullish  cross has been really predictive of 90-400% gains over the last year, and I want me some of that.  To help confirm the uptrend we see hidden  bullish divergence  with the price action and the  MACD .  I would be more comforted if I also saw the divergence on the  RSI , but that isn't something we see at the 2D level but we do see at the 12H, which is a pretty high level time frame to see hidden divergence on for crypto, ususally it rebounds before then. 







We also see we are coming out of oversold on the  RSI  and the  Stochastic RSI  is suring upward.  There is enough confirmation here to go long for almost any skeptic.  I am using the 2D to confirm this entry but I will probably use the 1D indicators to time my exit.

XMR, the top anonymity coin has sustained a breakout from its  downward channel  with USD and  BTC 0.46% .  

We target a 50%  fibonacci retracement  from its end of April high. Use small leverage and capital.  BTC 0.46%  is hovering along the edge zone of a  downward channel , and a small movement in  BTC 0.46%  could impact the price of XMR substantially.  

Buy: 120-125 

Target 1: 135 (11.25%/8%) 
Target 2: 156 (30%/24.8%)
