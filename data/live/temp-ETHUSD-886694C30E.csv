All in all, overhead resistance is very strong. It needs time and right setup to pierce through. But you can see that 367 level is very an important level and should bounce back to  pivot  at 536 where coincides with the overhead resistance. This formation is also known as the  bearish flag  which will turn into another  bearish  move down to former  resistance level . After enough time passed on the low side, it can pierce through the overhead resistance in a head and shoulder pattern.

 Ethereum 0.67%  looked like it was forming an Adam and Adam  double bottom  on the 4hr; but, ETH failed to crest above the peak between the two valleys. Hence,  Ethereum 0.67%  (ETH) doesn't look like it's reversing the downtrend at this time. On the contrary, ETH appears to have formed - and broken below - a  bear flag .

Price is now at an interesting point with high probabilities of violent moves, be it up or down.  
Trendline  resistance remains strong, longs should be opened only after consecutive green closes above.
