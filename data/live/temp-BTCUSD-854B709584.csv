43 minutes ago




A couple of days ago we had a massive move upwards (correction)! The day ends with an Engulfing  candlestick  pattern and closes above THE MAIN BIG TRENDLINE sine 17.12.2017 which means we broke the main down-trend at the moment!  
Right now the  BTC -0.59%  price forms a continuation pattern - ""Bull Flag"".  Bull Flag  is supported by EMA's and a  resistance area  which becomes a support! This resistance/support area is also a restest from W formation breakout trade ( Double bottom ) - breakout area was $6300 and now we retest it. 






So, this is the first option to go upwards from here! The second option is at the $6100 level! Recently, the market is very sensitive on Fibonacci levels, especially the main retracement level at 62%! We might see some pullback to $6100 where is our strong green line and also supported with  Fibonacci retracement  level 62%! 
Summary: I think that now we see some ""green"" in the market at least several days, this is very hard to tell was this THE MAIN REVERSAL point or not! If whales want's to lower the price again then they can do it but the whole market sentiment is at the moment  bullish  and also from TA. perspective!

					EDUCATIONAL LESSON - Engulfing candlestick pattern 

""The Engulfing pattern is a two-candle reversal pattern. A reversal pattern that can be bearish or bullish, depending upon whether it appears at the end of an uptrend (bearish engulfing pattern) or a downtrend (bullish engulfing pattern). The first day is characterized by a small body, followed by a day whose body completely engulfs the previous day's body and closes in the opposite direction of the trend.""

 Bitcoin -0.59%  has added less than one percent in the past 24 hours, but the most important events happened on Saturday, when the price made a huge upside burst breaking through a couple of resistance areas. BTC/USD seems to finally find its support and thanks to news from  Facebook -0.97%  the whole crypto market is positive currently. 

Looking closer at the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has jumped over the resistance areas at $6,071 and $6,329. The currency pair stays above $6,329 in the moment of writing, we have a clear  Flag pattern , which means the probability for  Bitcoin -0.59%  to develop its upside tendency.  
We think that BTC/USD is going to grow higher targeting the closest  resistance area  at $6,510, where we have put the green flag. If buyers successful there, they will be able to drive the currency pair even higher targeting the next resistance at $6,943. 
The less probable way for BTC/USD is to fall down towards the next  support area  at $6,071. The  Flag pattern  will be broken in this case.

 Bitcoin -0.58%  has added less than one percent in the past 24 hours, but the most important events happened on Saturday, when the price made a huge upside burst breaking through a couple of resistance areas. BTC/USD seems to finally find its support and thanks to news from  Facebook -0.97%  the whole crypto market is positive currently. 

Looking closer at the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has jumped over the resistance areas at $6,071 and $6,329. The currency pair stays above $6,329 in the moment of writing, we have a clear  Flag pattern , which means the probability for  Bitcoin -0.58%  to develop its upside tendency.  
We think that BTC/USD is going to grow higher targeting the closest  resistance area  at $6,510, where we have put the green flag. If buyers successful there, they will be able to drive the currency pair even higher targeting the next resistance at $6,943. 
The less probable way for BTC/USD is to fall down towards the next  support area  at $6,071. The  Flag pattern  will be broken in this case.

A couple of days ago we had a massive move upwards (correction)! The day ends with an Engulfing  candlestick  pattern and closes above THE MAIN BIG TRENDLINE sine 17.12.2017 which means we broke the main down-trend at the moment!  
Right now the  BTC -0.59%  price forms a continuation pattern - ""Bull Flag"".  Bull Flag  is supported by EMA's and a  resistance area  which becomes a support! This resistance/support area is also a restest from W formation breakout trade ( Double bottom ) - breakout area was $6300 and now we retest it. 






So, this is the first option to go upwards from here! The second option is at the $6100 level! Recently, the market is very sensitive on Fibonacci levels, especially the main retracement level at 62%! We might see some pullback to $6100 where is our strong green line and also supported with  Fibonacci retracement  level 62%! 
Summary: I think that now we see some ""green"" in the market at least several days, this is very hard to tell was this THE MAIN REVERSAL point or not! If whales want's to lower the price again then they can do it but the whole market sentiment is at the moment  bullish  and also from TA. perspective!

We think that BTC/USD is going to grow higher targeting the closest  resistance area  at $6,510, where we have put the green flag. If buyers successful there, they will be able to drive the currency pair even higher targeting the next resistance at $6,943. 
The less probable way for BTC/USD is to fall down towards the next  support area  at $6,071. The  Flag pattern  will be broken in this case.

A couple of days ago we had a massive move upwards (correction)! The day ends with an Engulfing  candlestick  pattern and closes above THE MAIN BIG TRENDLINE sine 17.12.2017 which means we broke the main down-trend at the moment!  
Right now the  BTC              price forms a continuation pattern - ""Bull Flag"".  Bull Flag  is supported by EMA's and a  resistance area  which becomes a support! This resistance/support area is also a restest from W formation breakout trade ( Double bottom ) - breakout area was $6300 and now we retest it. 






So, this is the first option to go upwards from here! The second option is at the $6100 level! Recently, the market is very sensitive on Fibonacci levels, especially the main retracement level at 62%! We might see some pullback to $6100 where is our strong green line and also supported with  Fibonacci retracement  level 62%! 
Summary: I think that now we see some ""green"" in the market at least several days, this is very hard to tell was this THE MAIN REVERSAL point or not! If whales want's to lower the price again then they can do it but the whole market sentiment is at the moment  bullish  and also from TA. perspective!

					EDUCATIONAL LESSON - Engulfing candlestick pattern 

""The Engulfing pattern is a two-candle reversal pattern. A reversal pattern that can be bearish or bullish, depending upon whether it appears at the end of an uptrend (bearish engulfing pattern) or a downtrend (bullish engulfing pattern). The first day is characterized by a small body, followed by a day whose body completely engulfs the previous day's body and closes in the opposite direction of the trend.""

A couple of days ago we had a massive move upwards (correction)! The day ends with an Engulfing  candlestick  pattern and closes above THE MAIN BIG TRENDLINE sine 17.12.2017 which means we broke the main down-trend at the moment!  
Right now the  BTC -0.56%  price forms a continuation pattern - ""Bull Flag"".  Bull Flag  is supported by EMA's and a  resistance area  which becomes a support! This resistance/support area is also a restest from W formation breakout trade ( Double bottom ) - breakout area was $6300 and now we retest it. 






So, this is the first option to go upwards from here! The second option is at the $6100 level! Recently, the market is very sensitive on Fibonacci levels, especially the main retracement level at 62%! We might see some pullback to $6100 where is our strong green line and also supported with  Fibonacci retracement  level 62%! 
Summary: I think that now we see some ""green"" in the market at least several days, this is very hard to tell was this THE MAIN REVERSAL point or not! If whales want's to lower the price again then they can do it but the whole market sentiment is at the moment  bullish  and also from TA. perspective!

					EDUCATIONAL LESSON - Engulfing candlestick pattern 

""The Engulfing pattern is a two-candle reversal pattern. A reversal pattern that can be bearish or bullish, depending upon whether it appears at the end of an uptrend (bearish engulfing pattern) or a downtrend (bullish engulfing pattern). The first day is characterized by a small body, followed by a day whose body completely engulfs the previous day's body and closes in the opposite direction of the trend.""

 Bitcoin              has added less than one percent in the past 24 hours, but the most important events happened on Saturday, when the price made a huge upside burst breaking through a couple of resistance areas. BTC/USD seems to finally find its support and thanks to news from  Facebook              the whole crypto market is positive currently. 

Looking closer at the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has jumped over the resistance areas at $6,071 and $6,329. The currency pair stays above $6,329 in the moment of writing, we have a clear  Flag pattern , which means the probability for  Bitcoin              to develop its upside tendency.  
We think that BTC/USD is going to grow higher targeting the closest  resistance area  at $6,510, where we have put the green flag. If buyers successful there, they will be able to drive the currency pair even higher targeting the next resistance at $6,943. 
The less probable way for BTC/USD is to fall down towards the next  support area  at $6,071. The  Flag pattern  will be broken in this case.

 Bitcoin -0.56%  has added less than one percent in the past 24 hours, but the most important events happened on Saturday, when the price made a huge upside burst breaking through a couple of resistance areas. BTC/USD seems to finally find its support and thanks to news from  Facebook              the whole crypto market is positive currently. 

Looking closer at the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has jumped over the resistance areas at $6,071 and $6,329. The currency pair stays above $6,329 in the moment of writing, we have a clear  Flag pattern , which means the probability for  Bitcoin -0.56%  to develop its upside tendency.  
We think that BTC/USD is going to grow higher targeting the closest  resistance area  at $6,510, where we have put the green flag. If buyers successful there, they will be able to drive the currency pair even higher targeting the next resistance at $6,943. 
The less probable way for BTC/USD is to fall down towards the next  support area  at $6,071. The  Flag pattern  will be broken in this case.

A couple of days ago we had a massive move upwards (correction)! The day ends with an Engulfing  candlestick  pattern and closes above THE MAIN BIG TRENDLINE sine 17.12.2017 which means we broke the main down-trend at the moment!  
Right now the  BTC -0.56%  price forms a continuation pattern - ""Bull Flag"".  Bull Flag  is supported by EMA's and a  resistance area  which becomes a support! This resistance/support area is also a restest from W formation breakout trade ( Double bottom ) - breakout area was $6300 and now we retest it. 






So, this is the first option to go upwards from here! The second option is at the $6100 level! Recently, the market is very sensitive on Fibonacci levels, especially the main retracement level at 62%! We might see some pullback to $6100 where is our strong green line and also supported with  Fibonacci retracement  level 62%! 
Summary: I think that now we see some ""green"" in the market at least several days, this is very hard to tell was this THE MAIN REVERSAL point or not! If whales want's to lower the price again then they can do it but the whole market sentiment is at the moment  bullish  and also from TA. perspective!

an hour ago




A couple of days ago we had a massive move upwards (correction)! The day ends with an Engulfing  candlestick  pattern and closes above THE MAIN BIG TRENDLINE sine 17.12.2017 which means we broke the main down-trend at the moment!  
Right now the  BTC -0.51%  price forms a continuation pattern - ""Bull Flag"".  Bull Flag  is supported by EMA's and a  resistance area  which becomes a support! This resistance/support area is also a restest from W formation breakout trade ( Double bottom ) - breakout area was $6300 and now we retest it. 






So, this is the first option to go upwards from here! The second option is at the $6100 level! Recently, the market is very sensitive on Fibonacci levels, especially the main retracement level at 62%! We might see some pullback to $6100 where is our strong green line and also supported with  Fibonacci retracement  level 62%! 
Summary: I think that now we see some ""green"" in the market at least several days, this is very hard to tell was this THE MAIN REVERSAL point or not! If whales want's to lower the price again then they can do it but the whole market sentiment is at the moment  bullish  and also from TA. perspective!

					EDUCATIONAL LESSON - Engulfing candlestick pattern 

""The Engulfing pattern is a two-candle reversal pattern. A reversal pattern that can be bearish or bullish, depending upon whether it appears at the end of an uptrend (bearish engulfing pattern) or a downtrend (bullish engulfing pattern). The first day is characterized by a small body, followed by a day whose body completely engulfs the previous day's body and closes in the opposite direction of the trend.""

 Bitcoin -0.51%  has added less than one percent in the past 24 hours, but the most important events happened on Saturday, when the price made a huge upside burst breaking through a couple of resistance areas. BTC/USD seems to finally find its support and thanks to news from  Facebook              the whole crypto market is positive currently. 

Looking closer at the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has jumped over the resistance areas at $6,071 and $6,329. The currency pair stays above $6,329 in the moment of writing, we have a clear  Flag pattern , which means the probability for  Bitcoin -0.51%  to develop its upside tendency.  
We think that BTC/USD is going to grow higher targeting the closest  resistance area  at $6,510, where we have put the green flag. If buyers successful there, they will be able to drive the currency pair even higher targeting the next resistance at $6,943. 
The less probable way for BTC/USD is to fall down towards the next  support area  at $6,071. The  Flag pattern  will be broken in this case.

A couple of days ago we had a massive move upwards (correction)! The day ends with an Engulfing  candlestick  pattern and closes above THE MAIN BIG TRENDLINE sine 17.12.2017 which means we broke the main down-trend at the moment!  
Right now the  BTC -0.47%  price forms a continuation pattern - ""Bull Flag"".  Bull Flag  is supported by EMA's and a  resistance area  which becomes a support! This resistance/support area is also a restest from W formation breakout trade ( Double bottom ) - breakout area was $6300 and now we retest it. 






So, this is the first option to go upwards from here! The second option is at the $6100 level! Recently, the market is very sensitive on Fibonacci levels, especially the main retracement level at 62%! We might see some pullback to $6100 where is our strong green line and also supported with  Fibonacci retracement  level 62%! 
Summary: I think that now we see some ""green"" in the market at least several days, this is very hard to tell was this THE MAIN REVERSAL point or not! If whales want's to lower the price again then they can do it but the whole market sentiment is at the moment  bullish  and also from TA. perspective!

					EDUCATIONAL LESSON - Engulfing candlestick pattern 

""The Engulfing pattern is a two-candle reversal pattern. A reversal pattern that can be bearish or bullish, depending upon whether it appears at the end of an uptrend (bearish engulfing pattern) or a downtrend (bullish engulfing pattern). The first day is characterized by a small body, followed by a day whose body completely engulfs the previous day's body and closes in the opposite direction of the trend.""

 Bitcoin -0.48%  has added less than one percent in the past 24 hours, but the most important events happened on Saturday, when the price made a huge upside burst breaking through a couple of resistance areas. BTC/USD seems to finally find its support and thanks to news from  Facebook              the whole crypto market is positive currently. 

Looking closer at the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has jumped over the resistance areas at $6,071 and $6,329. The currency pair stays above $6,329 in the moment of writing, we have a clear  Flag pattern , which means the probability for  Bitcoin -0.48%  to develop its upside tendency.  
We think that BTC/USD is going to grow higher targeting the closest  resistance area  at $6,510, where we have put the green flag. If buyers successful there, they will be able to drive the currency pair even higher targeting the next resistance at $6,943. 
The less probable way for BTC/USD is to fall down towards the next  support area  at $6,071. The  Flag pattern  will be broken in this case.

A couple of days ago we had a massive move upwards (correction)! The day ends with an Engulfing  candlestick  pattern and closes above THE MAIN BIG TRENDLINE sine 17.12.2017 which means we broke the main down-trend at the moment!  
Right now the  BTC -0.48%  price forms a continuation pattern - ""Bull Flag"".  Bull Flag  is supported by EMA's and a  resistance area  which becomes a support! This resistance/support area is also a restest from W formation breakout trade ( Double bottom ) - breakout area was $6300 and now we retest it. 






So, this is the first option to go upwards from here! The second option is at the $6100 level! Recently, the market is very sensitive on Fibonacci levels, especially the main retracement level at 62%! We might see some pullback to $6100 where is our strong green line and also supported with  Fibonacci retracement  level 62%!

 Bitcoin -0.53%  has added less than one percent in the past 24 hours, but the most important events happened on Saturday, when the price made a huge upside burst breaking through a couple of resistance areas. BTC/USD seems to finally find its support and thanks to news from  Facebook              the whole crypto market is positive currently. 

Looking closer at the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has jumped over the resistance areas at $6,071 and $6,329. The currency pair stays above $6,329 in the moment of writing, we have a clear  Flag pattern , which means the probability for  Bitcoin -0.53%  to develop its upside tendency.  
We think that BTC/USD is going to grow higher targeting the closest  resistance area  at $6,510, where we have put the green flag. If buyers successful there, they will be able to drive the currency pair even higher targeting the next resistance at $6,943. 
The less probable way for BTC/USD is to fall down towards the next  support area  at $6,071. The  Flag pattern  will be broken in this case.

A couple of days ago we had a massive move upwards (correction)! The day ends with an Engulfing  candlestick  pattern and closes above THE MAIN BIG TRENDLINE sine 17.12.2017 which means we broke the main down-trend at the moment!  
Right now the  BTC -0.53%  price forms a continuation pattern - ""Bull Flag"".  Bull Flag  is supported by EMA's and a  resistance area  which becomes a support! This resistance/support area is also a restest from W formation breakout trade ( Double bottom ) - breakout area was $6300 and now we retest it. 






So, this is the first option to go upwards from here! The second option is at the $6100 level! Recently, the market is very sensitive on Fibonacci levels, especially the main retracement level at 62%! We might see some pullback to $6100 where is our strong green line and also supported with  Fibonacci retracement  level 62%! 
Summary: I think that now we see some ""green"" in the market at least several days, this is very hard to tell was this THE MAIN REVERSAL point or not! If whales want's to lower the price again then they can do it but the whole market sentiment is at the moment  bullish  and also from TA. perspective!

					EDUCATIONAL LESSON - Engulfing candlestick pattern 

""The Engulfing pattern is a two-candle reversal pattern. A reversal pattern that can be bearish or bullish, depending upon whether it appears at the end of an uptrend (bearish engulfing pattern) or a downtrend (bullish engulfing pattern). The first day is characterized by a small body, followed by a day whose body completely engulfs the previous day's body and closes in the opposite direction of the trend.""

A couple of days ago we had a massive move upwards (correction)! The day ends with an Engulfing  candlestick  pattern and closes above THE MAIN BIG TRENDLINE sine 17.12.2017 which means we broke the main down-trend at the moment!  
Right now the  BTC -0.56%  price forms a continuation pattern - ""Bull Flag"".  Bull Flag  is supported by EMA's and a  resistance area  which becomes a support! This resistance/support area is also a restest from W formation breakout trade ( Double bottom ) - breakout area was $6300 and now we retest it. 






So, this is the first option to go upwards from here! The second option is at the $6100 level! Recently, the market is very sensitive on Fibonacci levels, especially the main retracement level at 62%! We might see some pullback to $6100 where is our strong green line and also supported with  Fibonacci retracement  level 62%! 
Summary: I think that now we see some ""green"" in the market at least several days, this is very hard to tell was this THE MAIN REVERSAL point or not! If whales want's to lower the price again then they can do it but the whole market sentiment is at the moment  bullish  and also from TA. perspective!

					EDUCATIONAL LESSON - Engulfing candlestick pattern 

""The Engulfing pattern is a two-candle reversal pattern. A reversal pattern that can be bearish or bullish, depending upon whether it appears at the end of an uptrend (bearish engulfing pattern) or a downtrend (bullish engulfing pattern). The first day is characterized by a small body, followed by a day whose body completely engulfs the previous day's body and closes in the opposite direction of the trend.""

 Bitcoin              has added less than one percent in the past 24 hours, but the most important events happened on Saturday, when the price made a huge upside burst breaking through a couple of resistance areas. BTC/USD seems to finally find its support and thanks to news from  Facebook              the whole crypto market is positive currently. 

Looking closer at the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has jumped over the resistance areas at $6,071 and $6,329. The currency pair stays above $6,329 in the moment of writing, we have a clear  Flag pattern , which means the probability for  Bitcoin              to develop its upside tendency.  
We think that BTC/USD is going to grow higher targeting the closest  resistance area  at $6,510, where we have put the green flag. If buyers successful there, they will be able to drive the currency pair even higher targeting the next resistance at $6,943. 
The less probable way for BTC/USD is to fall down towards the next  support area  at $6,071. The  Flag pattern  will be broken in this case.

So, this is the first option to go upwards from here! The second option is at the $6100 level! Recently, the market is very sensitive on Fibonacci levels, especially the main retracement level at 62%! We might see some pullback to $6100 where is our strong green line and also supported with  Fibonacci retracement  level 62%! 
Summary: I think that now we see some ""green"" in the market at least several days, this is very hard to tell was this THE MAIN REVERSAL point or not! If whales want's to lower the price again then they can do it but the whole market sentiment is at the moment  bullish  and also from TA. perspective!

					EDUCATIONAL LESSON - Engulfing candlestick pattern 

""The Engulfing pattern is a two-candle reversal pattern. A reversal pattern that can be bearish or bullish, depending upon whether it appears at the end of an uptrend (bearish engulfing pattern) or a downtrend (bullish engulfing pattern). The first day is characterized by a small body, followed by a day whose body completely engulfs the previous day's body and closes in the opposite direction of the trend.""

 Bitcoin -0.54%  has added less than one percent in the past 24 hours, but the most important events happened on Saturday, when the price made a huge upside burst breaking through a couple of resistance areas. BTC/USD seems to finally find its support and thanks to news from  Facebook -0.97%  the whole crypto market is positive currently. 

Looking closer at the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has jumped over the resistance areas at $6,071 and $6,329. The currency pair stays above $6,329 in the moment of writing, we have a clear  Flag pattern , which means the probability for  Bitcoin -0.54%  to develop its upside tendency.  
We think that BTC/USD is going to grow higher targeting the closest  resistance area  at $6,510, where we have put the green flag. If buyers successful there, they will be able to drive the currency pair even higher targeting the next resistance at $6,943. 
The less probable way for BTC/USD is to fall down towards the next  support area  at $6,071. The  Flag pattern  will be broken in this case.

 Bitcoin -0.45%  has added less than one percent in the past 24 hours, but the most important events happened on Saturday, when the price made a huge upside burst breaking through a couple of resistance areas. BTC/USD seems to finally find its support and thanks to news from  Facebook              the whole crypto market is positive currently. 

Looking closer at the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has jumped over the resistance areas at $6,071 and $6,329. The currency pair stays above $6,329 in the moment of writing, we have a clear  Flag pattern , which means the probability for  Bitcoin -0.45%  to develop its upside tendency.  
We think that BTC/USD is going to grow higher targeting the closest  resistance area  at $6,510, where we have put the green flag. If buyers successful there, they will be able to drive the currency pair even higher targeting the next resistance at $6,943. 
The less probable way for BTC/USD is to fall down towards the next  support area  at $6,071. The  Flag pattern  will be broken in this case.

A couple of days ago we had a massive move upwards (correction)! The day ends with an Engulfing  candlestick  pattern and closes above THE MAIN BIG TRENDLINE sine 17.12.2017 which means we broke the main down-trend at the moment!  
Right now the  BTC -0.45%  price forms a continuation pattern - ""Bull Flag"".  Bull Flag  is supported by EMA's and a  resistance area  which becomes a support! This resistance/support area is also a restest from W formation breakout trade ( Double bottom ) - breakout area was $6300 and now we retest it. 






So, this is the first option to go upwards from here! The second option is at the $6100 level! Recently, the market is very sensitive on Fibonacci levels, especially the main retracement level at 62%! We might see some pullback to $6100 where is our strong green line and also supported with  Fibonacci retracement  level 62%! 
Summary: I think that now we see some ""green"" in the market at least several days, this is very hard to tell was this THE MAIN REVERSAL point or not! If whales want's to lower the price again then they can do it but the whole market sentiment is at the moment  bullish  and also from TA. perspective!

The less probable way for BTC/USD is to fall down towards the next  support area  at $6,071. The  Flag pattern  will be broken in this case.

A couple of days ago we had a massive move upwards (correction)! The day ends with an Engulfing  candlestick  pattern and closes above THE MAIN BIG TRENDLINE sine 17.12.2017 which means we broke the main down-trend at the moment!  
Right now the  BTC -0.42%  price forms a continuation pattern - ""Bull Flag"".  Bull Flag  is supported by EMA's and a  resistance area  which becomes a support! This resistance/support area is also a restest from W formation breakout trade ( Double bottom ) - breakout area was $6300 and now we retest it. 






So, this is the first option to go upwards from here! The second option is at the $6100 level! Recently, the market is very sensitive on Fibonacci levels, especially the main retracement level at 62%! We might see some pullback to $6100 where is our strong green line and also supported with  Fibonacci retracement  level 62%! 
Summary: I think that now we see some ""green"" in the market at least several days, this is very hard to tell was this THE MAIN REVERSAL point or not! If whales want's to lower the price again then they can do it but the whole market sentiment is at the moment  bullish  and also from TA. perspective!

					EDUCATIONAL LESSON - Engulfing candlestick pattern 

""The Engulfing pattern is a two-candle reversal pattern. A reversal pattern that can be bearish or bullish, depending upon whether it appears at the end of an uptrend (bearish engulfing pattern) or a downtrend (bullish engulfing pattern). The first day is characterized by a small body, followed by a day whose body completely engulfs the previous day's body and closes in the opposite direction of the trend.""

1530512288.0,VaidoVeek,BITCOIN BREAK THE MAIN BIG TRENDLINE!,"




an hour ago




A couple of days ago we had a massive move upwards (correction)! The day ends with an Engulfing  candlestick  pattern and closes above THE MAIN BIG TRENDLINE sine 17.12.2017 which means we broke the main down-trend at the moment!  
Right now the  BTC -0.32%  price forms a continuation pattern - ""Bull Flag"".  Bull Flag  is supported by EMA's and a  resistance area  which becomes a support! This resistance/support area is also a restest from W formation breakout trade ( Double bottom ) - breakout area was $6300 and now we retest it. 






So, this is the first option to go upwards from here! The second option is at the $6100 level! Recently, the market is very sensitive on Fibonacci levels, especially the main retracement level at 62%! We might see some pullback to $6100 where is our strong green line and also supported with  Fibonacci retracement  level 62%! 
Summary: I think that now we see some ""green"" in the market at least several days, this is very hard to tell was this THE MAIN REVERSAL point or not! If whales want's to lower the price again then they can do it but the whole market sentiment is at the moment  bullish  and also from TA. perspective!

					EDUCATIONAL LESSON - Engulfing candlestick pattern 

""The Engulfing pattern is a two-candle reversal pattern. A reversal pattern that can be bearish or bullish, depending upon whether it appears at the end of an uptrend (bearish engulfing pattern) or a downtrend (bullish engulfing pattern). The first day is characterized by a small body, followed by a day whose body completely engulfs the previous day's body and closes in the opposite direction of the trend.""

 Bitcoin -0.25%  has added less than one percent in the past 24 hours, but the most important events happened on Saturday, when the price made a huge upside burst breaking through a couple of resistance areas. BTC/USD seems to finally find its support and thanks to news from  Facebook -0.97%  the whole crypto market is positive currently. 

Looking closer at the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has jumped over the resistance areas at $6,071 and $6,329. The currency pair stays above $6,329 in the moment of writing, we have a clear  Flag pattern , which means the probability for  Bitcoin -0.25%  to develop its upside tendency.  
We think that BTC/USD is going to grow higher targeting the closest  resistance area  at $6,510, where we have put the green flag. If buyers successful there, they will be able to drive the currency pair even higher targeting the next resistance at $6,943. 
The less probable way for BTC/USD is to fall down towards the next  support area  at $6,071. The  Flag pattern  will be broken in this case.

 Bitcoin -0.36%  has added less than one percent in the past 24 hours, but the most important events happened on Saturday, when the price made a huge upside burst breaking through a couple of resistance areas. BTC/USD seems to finally find its support and thanks to news from  Facebook              the whole crypto market is positive currently. 

Looking closer at the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has jumped over the resistance areas at $6,071 and $6,329. The currency pair stays above $6,329 in the moment of writing, we have a clear  Flag pattern , which means the probability for  Bitcoin -0.36%  to develop its upside tendency.  
We think that BTC/USD is going to grow higher targeting the closest  resistance area  at $6,510, where we have put the green flag. If buyers successful there, they will be able to drive the currency pair even higher targeting the next resistance at $6,943. 
The less probable way for BTC/USD is to fall down towards the next  support area  at $6,071. The  Flag pattern  will be broken in this case.

A couple of days ago we had a massive move upwards (correction)! The day ends with an Engulfing  candlestick  pattern and closes above THE MAIN BIG TRENDLINE sine 17.12.2017 which means we broke the main down-trend at the moment!  
Right now the  BTC -0.39%  price forms a continuation pattern - ""Bull Flag"".  Bull Flag  is supported by EMA's and a  resistance area  which becomes a support! This resistance/support area is also a restest from W formation breakout trade ( Double bottom ) - breakout area was $6300 and now we retest it. 






So, this is the first option to go upwards from here! The second option is at the $6100 level! Recently, the market is very sensitive on Fibonacci levels, especially the main retracement level at 62%! We might see some pullback to $6100 where is our strong green line and also supported with  Fibonacci retracement  level 62%! 
Summary: I think that now we see some ""green"" in the market at least several days, this is very hard to tell was this THE MAIN REVERSAL point or not! If whales want's to lower the price again then they can do it but the whole market sentiment is at the moment  bullish  and also from TA. perspective!

					EDUCATIONAL LESSON - Engulfing candlestick pattern 

""The Engulfing pattern is a two-candle reversal pattern. A reversal pattern that can be bearish or bullish, depending upon whether it appears at the end of an uptrend (bearish engulfing pattern) or a downtrend (bullish engulfing pattern). The first day is characterized by a small body, followed by a day whose body completely engulfs the previous day's body and closes in the opposite direction of the trend.""

BTC/USD seems to finally find its support and thanks to news from  Facebook -0.97%  the whole crypto market is positive currently. 

Looking closer at the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has jumped over the resistance areas at $6,071 and $6,329. The currency pair stays above $6,329 in the moment of writing, we have a clear  Flag pattern , which means the probability for  Bitcoin -0.37%  to develop its upside tendency.  
We think that BTC/USD is going to grow higher targeting the closest  resistance area  at $6,510, where we have put the green flag. If buyers successful there, they will be able to drive the currency pair even higher targeting the next resistance at $6,943. 
The less probable way for BTC/USD is to fall down towards the next  support area  at $6,071. The  Flag pattern  will be broken in this case.

A couple of days ago we had a massive move upwards (correction)! The day ends with an Engulfing  candlestick  pattern and closes above THE MAIN BIG TRENDLINE sine 17.12.2017 which means we broke the main down-trend at the moment!  
Right now the  BTC -0.36%  price forms a continuation pattern - ""Bull Flag"".  Bull Flag  is supported by EMA's and a  resistance area  which becomes a support! This resistance/support area is also a restest from W formation breakout trade ( Double bottom ) - breakout area was $6300 and now we retest it. 






So, this is the first option to go upwards from here! The second option is at the $6100 level! Recently, the market is very sensitive on Fibonacci levels, especially the main retracement level at 62%! We might see some pullback to $6100 where is our strong green line and also supported with  Fibonacci retracement  level 62%! 
Summary: I think that now we see some ""green"" in the market at least several days, this is very hard to tell was this THE MAIN REVERSAL point or not! If whales want's to lower the price again then they can do it but the whole market sentiment is at the moment  bullish  and also from TA. perspective!

					EDUCATIONAL LESSON - Engulfing candlestick pattern 

""The Engulfing pattern is a two-candle reversal pattern. A reversal pattern that can be bearish or bullish, depending upon whether it appears at the end of an uptrend (bearish engulfing pattern) or a downtrend (bullish engulfing pattern). The first day is characterized by a small body, followed by a day whose body completely engulfs the previous day's body and closes in the opposite direction of the trend.""

an hour ago




A couple of days ago we had a massive move upwards (correction)! The day ends with an Engulfing  candlestick  pattern and closes above THE MAIN BIG TRENDLINE sine 17.12.2017 which means we broke the main down-trend at the moment!  
Right now the  BTC -0.28%  price forms a continuation pattern - ""Bull Flag"".  Bull Flag  is supported by EMA's and a  resistance area  which becomes a support! This resistance/support area is also a restest from W formation breakout trade ( Double bottom ) - breakout area was $6300 and now we retest it. 






So, this is the first option to go upwards from here! The second option is at the $6100 level! Recently, the market is very sensitive on Fibonacci levels, especially the main retracement level at 62%! We might see some pullback to $6100 where is our strong green line and also supported with  Fibonacci retracement  level 62%! 
Summary: I think that now we see some ""green"" in the market at least several days, this is very hard to tell was this THE MAIN REVERSAL point or not! If whales want's to lower the price again then they can do it but the whole market sentiment is at the moment  bullish  and also from TA. perspective!

					EDUCATIONAL LESSON - Engulfing candlestick pattern 

""The Engulfing pattern is a two-candle reversal pattern. A reversal pattern that can be bearish or bullish, depending upon whether it appears at the end of an uptrend (bearish engulfing pattern) or a downtrend (bullish engulfing pattern). The first day is characterized by a small body, followed by a day whose body completely engulfs the previous day's body and closes in the opposite direction of the trend.""

 Bitcoin -0.28%  has added less than one percent in the past 24 hours, but the most important events happened on Saturday, when the price made a huge upside burst breaking through a couple of resistance areas. BTC/USD seems to finally find its support and thanks to news from  Facebook -0.97%  the whole crypto market is positive currently. 

Looking closer at the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has jumped over the resistance areas at $6,071 and $6,329. The currency pair stays above $6,329 in the moment of writing, we have a clear  Flag pattern , which means the probability for  Bitcoin -0.28%  to develop its upside tendency.  
We think that BTC/USD is going to grow higher targeting the closest  resistance area  at $6,510, where we have put the green flag. If buyers successful there, they will be able to drive the currency pair even higher targeting the next resistance at $6,943. 
The less probable way for BTC/USD is to fall down towards the next  support area  at $6,071. The  Flag pattern  will be broken in this case.

 Bitcoin -0.32%  has added less than one percent in the past 24 hours, but the most important events happened on Saturday, when the price made a huge upside burst breaking through a couple of resistance areas. BTC/USD seems to finally find its support and thanks to news from  Facebook              the whole crypto market is positive currently. 

Looking closer at the Hourly chart we can see that BTC/USD has jumped over the resistance areas at $6,071 and $6,329. The currency pair stays above $6,329 in the moment of writing, we have a clear  Flag pattern , which means the probability for  Bitcoin -0.32%  to develop its upside tendency.  
We think that BTC/USD is going to grow higher targeting the closest  resistance area  at $6,510, where we have put the green flag. If buyers successful there, they will be able to drive the currency pair even higher targeting the next resistance at $6,943. 
The less probable way for BTC/USD is to fall down towards the next  support area  at $6,071. The  Flag pattern  will be broken in this case.

A couple of days ago we had a massive move upwards (correction)! The day ends with an Engulfing  candlestick  pattern and closes above THE MAIN BIG TRENDLINE sine 17.12.2017 which means we broke the main down-trend at the moment!  
Right now the  BTC -0.34%  price forms a continuation pattern - ""Bull Flag"".  Bull Flag  is supported by EMA's and a  resistance area  which becomes a support! This resistance/support area is also a restest from W formation breakout trade ( Double bottom ) - breakout area was $6300 and now we retest it. 






So, this is the first option to go upwards from here! The second option is at the $6100 level! Recently, the market is very sensitive on Fibonacci levels, especially the main retracement level at 62%! We might see some pullback to $6100 where is our strong green line and also supported with  Fibonacci retracement  level 62%! 
Summary: I think that now we see some ""green"" in the market at least several days, this is very hard to tell was this THE MAIN REVERSAL point or not! If whales want's to lower the price again then they can do it but the whole market sentiment is at the moment  bullish  and also from TA. perspective!

					EDUCATIONAL LESSON - Engulfing candlestick pattern 

""The Engulfing pattern is a two-candle reversal pattern. A reversal pattern that can be bearish or bullish, depending upon whether it appears at the end of an uptrend (bearish engulfing pattern) or a downtrend (bullish engulfing pattern). The first day is characterized by a small body, followed by a day whose body completely engulfs the previous day's body and closes in the opposite direction of the trend.""
