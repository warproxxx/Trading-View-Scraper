The rate of Litecoin intends to fall further. 
Priority of the day:  LTCUSD 0.16%  will drop with a target of $ 75. 
We forecast a continuation of the  bearish trend  for Litecoin. The turning point for Litecoin can be the zone: $ 75 - $ 71, where it can start a new rising trend. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  LTCUSD 0.16%  rate will decrease from $ 84 to $ 75. 
2. The rate of  LTCUSD 0.16%  may stay in flat a few more days.

EXPECTING LTC TO RETRACE ALONG WITH  BTC 0.47% ,  STACKING LONG'S AT THAT GREEN AND PURPLE AREA AND WILL CONTINUE TO BUY EVERYTIME IT TOUCHES, THEN BE READY FOR THE BULL RUN. EXPECTING BTC'S DROP FINAL DROP BEING AROUND $4500-$4800, SIMILAR % LOSS.  
IF  BTC 0.47%  DROPS FURTHER... SO WILL LTC...I  SEE POSSIBLE RETRACEMENT IN THE LOW $60'S. 
START SAVING FIAT, IT WILL SOON BE TIME TO STACK UP AND ACCUMULATE LTC!!  

-NEVER FORCE A TRADE, LET IT COME TO YOU.  
PATIENCE IS ONE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT TRAITS OF A GREAT TRADER.  

GOOD LUCK TRADING,
