Looking for a 4 hour lower high and tightening range for the next couple days.  
Note ETH pulled back the hardest of the 3 ( BTC 0.52% , ETH, LTC) and therefore has the most ground to make up.  
LTC was also hit hard last night but the morning bounce has much more strength than ETH does.  
Still work watching for the weekly higher low to form if the bulls can break a tightening daily range in their favor to try and shift the momentum. 
Continuing to make the bulls prove it to us with  volume  and follow through.  
4 hour  EMA  resistance and if bulls get over it, daily  EMA  resistance will be right there waiting.

Testing the  trend line  again, hopefully we can make a bounc and test FIB 0.236 and break through for a test on the upper  trend line . 
We dont want to break the lower  trend line , then it can go ugly. BUT.. we have a MAJOR support at 350-390.  

A few minor resistance marked with pink line.

Been testing the  trend line  again, hopefully we can break above FIB 0.236 and test the upper  trend line . And further on break above it. But for now we have a really important area around 353-392 which must hold!!
