1531118552.0,porden,Possible fifth wave completion,"
It seems that Monero has now completed the first wave of the fifth wave , and its a good idea to go long on monero somewhere between 0.5 and 0.6 retracement levels of he wave 1. Target for this trade would be the complition of wave 3, based on 1:1 extension of wave 1
