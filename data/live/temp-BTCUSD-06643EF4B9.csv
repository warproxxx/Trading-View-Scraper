 Bitcoin              is still in a downtrend and has pulled back to a swing level. We can see some  bearish  rejection of that level but nothing major. I will risk a small trade on this one as downside potential is quite big.

Lol, This is really interesting spot 

As you can see in the main chart, we got rejected in last 12hrs (it was war!!!) 
However, bulls managed to defense $6,414 which was end of wave (4) 







So, I think it is more likely to go up. 
It is very suitable for both ""starting of long term uptrend(brown)"" and ""going to $7.3K first and down to HELL(blue)"" 
(Of course, I do support blue count, we need to go down more, maybe below $4.8K? :D) 

So, I will might put some long like below:

My original count was crazy so I stripped it down & redid it with a lot more simplicity so I could see the price action LOL. I have redone my counts so many times as the market shows us more of its intent. I was super  bearish  actually but decided to go against the grain for a little & have profited good thus far. I don’t believe the wave 5 will go too far or my extended 3rd theory will be invalidated unless it goes past 8000 hmmm...That’s a kinda pipe dream with this sentiment. I think my bias being a crypto fan boy makes me a perma-bear & I look for anything to make my counts fit that at times. I do keep the rules strict until invalidation. Definitely not perfect & I’ll slip a cog here or there LOL. This is what I kinda see may happen but the market will always do whatever it wants and humble even the haughtiest of a trader. I’ll be looking at all possibilities of course beyond  Elliott . Just an idea I’m long on currently. Tight stops. Mahalo & aloha!

Looking on the  RSI , we can see a reversal everytime when we hit an oversold situation, only despite on the last one. 
Furthermore we are forming a triangle, in which we are currently at the 4th wave. 
Hence we should see a small upwave and then a big last downwave due to the RSI! 

The small upwave:  






There are many different legit counts currently, but one of them is this one with quite perfekt  Elliott Wave  extentions. 







If we assume that our  Elliott Wave  is finished and we are now in a corrective  ABC  wave, than a normal correction to the 0.38 Fibonacci-level would be nearby at 7300$. 
Currently we have formed a  leading diagonal  and are waiting for a minor correction to a target between 6350$-6150$. 

The big downwave:  
At nearby 7300$ we should hit the major longterm resistance and heading downwards again. 
For the big downwards target please read my last TA I've written the last month ago. 




 

Personally my target is nearby 5000$ to 4700$, but that will be decided if I have more data.

Hello everybody, 

I made a post yesterday about the 6 month long  falling wedge bitcoin              entered. I want to explain a bit more of the fundamentals on why a  falling wedge  is a great way to see where price action has a good chance of going. 

If you don't know already, a  falling wedge  is a  bullish  signal. As it gets to the end the price starts moving more sideways and tighter into the point of the  wedge . When the candle sticks start to get towards the edge it is time to keep a close eye the price moving outside those lines.  

It's when the price exits on the top is the time to get into the trade. Be patient thought! Do not jump in the second the price is out. I like it to move a little further for confirmation because placing lines is not exact. 

Now the fun part about  falling wedge  breakouts is that the size of the end of the  wedge  is normally the size of the rally that happens. That is a lot of cheddar. If/when  bitcoin              breaks out we have a great chance of seeing all time highs being tested again quickly. 

Just my two cents on the issue.

Hello everybody, 

I made a post yesterday about the 6 month long  falling wedge bitcoin -0.52%  entered. I want to explain a bit more of the fundamentals on why a  falling wedge  is a great way to see where price action has a good chance of going. 

If you don't know already, a  falling wedge  is a  bullish  signal. As it gets to the end the price starts moving more sideways and tighter into the point of the  wedge . When the candle sticks start to get towards the edge it is time to keep a close eye the price moving outside those lines.  

It's when the price exits on the top is the time to get into the trade. Be patient thought! Do not jump in the second the price is out. I like it to move a little further for confirmation because placing lines is not exact. 

Now the fun part about  falling wedge  breakouts is that the size of the end of the  wedge  is normally the size of the rally that happens. That is a lot of cheddar. If/when  bitcoin -0.52%  breaks out we have a great chance of seeing all time highs being tested again quickly. 

Just my two cents on the issue.

 Bitcoin              is still in a downtrend and has pulled back to a swing level. We can see some  bearish  rejection of that level but nothing major. I will risk a small trade on this one as downside potential is quite big.

As you can see in the main chart, we got rejected in last 12hrs (it was war!!!) 
However, bulls managed to defense $6,414 which was end of wave (4) 







So, I think it is more likely to go up. 
It is very suitable for both ""starting of long term uptrend(brown)"" and ""going to $7.3K first and down to HELL(blue)""

Looking on the  RSI , we can see a reversal everytime when we hit an oversold situation, only despite on the last one. 
Furthermore we are forming a triangle, in which we are currently at the 4th wave. 
Hence we should see a small upwave and then a big last downwave due to the RSI! 

The small upwave:  






There are many different legit counts currently, but one of them is this one with quite perfekt  Elliott Wave  extentions. 







If we assume that our  Elliott Wave  is finished and we are now in a corrective  ABC  wave, than a normal correction to the 0.38 Fibonacci-level would be nearby at 7300$. 
Currently we have formed a  leading diagonal  and are waiting for a minor correction to a target between 6350$-6150$. 

The big downwave:  
At nearby 7300$ we should hit the major longterm resistance and heading downwards again. 
For the big downwards target please read my last TA I've written the last month ago.

Looking on the  RSI , we can see a reversal everytime when we hit an oversold situation, only despite on the last one. 
Furthermore we are forming a triangle, in which we are currently at the 4th wave. 
Hence we should see a small upwave and then a big last downwave due to the RSI! 

The small upwave:  






There are many different legit counts currently, but one of them is this one with quite perfekt  Elliott Wave  extentions. 







If we assume that our  Elliott Wave  is finished and we are now in a corrective  ABC  wave, than a normal correction to the 0.38 Fibonacci-level would be nearby at 7300$. 
Currently we have formed a  leading diagonal  and are waiting for a minor correction to a target between 6350$-6150$. 

The big downwave:  
At nearby 7300$ we should hit the major longterm resistance and heading downwards again. 
For the big downwards target please read my last TA I've written the last month ago. 




 

Personally my target is nearby 5000$ to 4700$, but that will be decided if I have more data.

Hello everybody, 

I made a post yesterday about the 6 month long  falling wedge bitcoin -0.43%  entered. I want to explain a bit more of the fundamentals on why a  falling wedge  is a great way to see where price action has a good chance of going. 

If you don't know already, a  falling wedge  is a  bullish  signal. As it gets to the end the price starts moving more sideways and tighter into the point of the  wedge . When the candle sticks start to get towards the edge it is time to keep a close eye the price moving outside those lines.  

It's when the price exits on the top is the time to get into the trade. Be patient thought! Do not jump in the second the price is out. I like it to move a little further for confirmation because placing lines is not exact. 

Now the fun part about  falling wedge  breakouts is that the size of the end of the  wedge  is normally the size of the rally that happens. That is a lot of cheddar. If/when  bitcoin -0.43%  breaks out we have a great chance of seeing all time highs being tested again quickly. 

Just my two cents on the issue.

 Bitcoin -0.43%  is still in a downtrend and has pulled back to a swing level. We can see some  bearish  rejection of that level but nothing major. I will risk a small trade on this one as downside potential is quite big.

However, bulls managed to defense $6,414 which was end of wave (4) 







So, I think it is more likely to go up.

If you don't know already, a  falling wedge  is a  bullish  signal. As it gets to the end the price starts moving more sideways and tighter into the point of the  wedge . When the candle sticks start to get towards the edge it is time to keep a close eye the price moving outside those lines.  

It's when the price exits on the top is the time to get into the trade. Be patient thought! Do not jump in the second the price is out. I like it to move a little further for confirmation because placing lines is not exact. 

Now the fun part about  falling wedge  breakouts is that the size of the end of the  wedge  is normally the size of the rally that happens. That is a lot of cheddar. If/when  bitcoin -0.38%  breaks out we have a great chance of seeing all time highs being tested again quickly. 

Just my two cents on the issue.

 Bitcoin -0.38%  is still in a downtrend and has pulled back to a swing level. We can see some  bearish  rejection of that level but nothing major. I will risk a small trade on this one as downside potential is quite big.

Lol, This is really interesting spot 

As you can see in the main chart, we got rejected in last 12hrs (it was war!!!) 
However, bulls managed to defense $6,414 which was end of wave (4) 







So, I think it is more likely to go up. 
It is very suitable for both ""starting of long term uptrend(brown)"" and ""going to $7.3K first and down to HELL(blue)"" 
(Of course, I do support blue count, we need to go down more, maybe below $4.8K? :D) 

So, I will might put some long like below:

My original count was crazy so I stripped it down & redid it with a lot more simplicity so I could see the price action LOL. I have redone my counts so many times as the market shows us more of its intent. I was super  bearish  actually but decided to go against the grain for a little & have profited good thus far. I don’t believe the wave 5 will go too far or my extended 3rd theory will be invalidated unless it goes past 8000 hmmm...That’s a kinda pipe dream with this sentiment. I think my bias being a crypto fan boy makes me a perma-bear & I look for anything to make my counts fit that at times. I do keep the rules strict until invalidation. Definitely not perfect & I’ll slip a cog here or there LOL. This is what I kinda see may happen but the market will always do whatever it wants and humble even the haughtiest of a trader. I’ll be looking at all possibilities of course beyond  Elliott . Just an idea I’m long on currently. Tight stops. Mahalo & aloha!

Looking on the  RSI , we can see a reversal everytime when we hit an oversold situation, only despite on the last one. 
Furthermore we are forming a triangle, in which we are currently at the 4th wave. 
Hence we should see a small upwave and then a big last downwave due to the RSI! 

The small upwave:  






There are many different legit counts currently, but one of them is this one with quite perfekt  Elliott Wave  extentions. 







If we assume that our  Elliott Wave  is finished and we are now in a corrective  ABC  wave, than a normal correction to the 0.38 Fibonacci-level would be nearby at 7300$. 
Currently we have formed a  leading diagonal  and are waiting for a minor correction to a target between 6350$-6150$. 

The big downwave:  
At nearby 7300$ we should hit the major longterm resistance and heading downwards again. 
For the big downwards target please read my last TA I've written the last month ago. 




 

Personally my target is nearby 5000$ to 4700$, but that will be decided if I have more data.

Looking on the  RSI , we can see a reversal everytime when we hit an oversold situation, only despite on the last one. 
Furthermore we are forming a triangle, in which we are currently at the 4th wave. 
Hence we should see a small upwave and then a big last downwave due to the RSI! 

The small upwave:  






There are many different legit counts currently, but one of them is this one with quite perfekt  Elliott Wave  extentions. 







If we assume that our  Elliott Wave  is finished and we are now in a corrective  ABC  wave, than a normal correction to the 0.38 Fibonacci-level would be nearby at 7300$. 
Currently we have formed a  leading diagonal  and are waiting for a minor correction to a target between 6350$-6150$. 

The big downwave:  
At nearby 7300$ we should hit the major longterm resistance and heading downwards again. 
For the big downwards target please read my last TA I've written the last month ago. 




 

Personally my target is nearby 5000$ to 4700$, but that will be decided if I have more data.

Hello everybody, 

I made a post yesterday about the 6 month long  falling wedge bitcoin -0.33%  entered. I want to explain a bit more of the fundamentals on why a  falling wedge  is a great way to see where price action has a good chance of going. 

If you don't know already, a  falling wedge  is a  bullish  signal. As it gets to the end the price starts moving more sideways and tighter into the point of the  wedge . When the candle sticks start to get towards the edge it is time to keep a close eye the price moving outside those lines.  

It's when the price exits on the top is the time to get into the trade. Be patient thought! Do not jump in the second the price is out. I like it to move a little further for confirmation because placing lines is not exact. 

Now the fun part about  falling wedge  breakouts is that the size of the end of the  wedge  is normally the size of the rally that happens. That is a lot of cheddar. If/when  bitcoin -0.33%  breaks out we have a great chance of seeing all time highs being tested again quickly. 

Just my two cents on the issue.

 Bitcoin              is still in a downtrend and has pulled back to a swing level. We can see some  bearish  rejection of that level but nothing major. I will risk a small trade on this one as downside potential is quite big.

My original count was crazy so I stripped it down & redid it with a lot more simplicity so I could see the price action LOL. I have redone my counts so many times as the market shows us more of its intent. I was super  bearish  actually but decided to go against the grain for a little & have profited good thus far. I don’t believe the wave 5 will go too far or my extended 3rd theory will be invalidated unless it goes past 8000 hmmm...That’s a kinda pipe dream with this sentiment. I think my bias being a crypto fan boy makes me a perma-bear & I look for anything to make my counts fit that at times. I do keep the rules strict until invalidation.

My original count was crazy so I stripped it down & redid it with a lot more simplicity so I could see the price action LOL. I have redone my counts so many times as the market shows us more of its intent. I was super  bearish  actually but decided to go against the grain for a little & have profited good thus far. I don’t believe the wave 5 will go too far or my extended 3rd theory will be invalidated unless it goes past 8000 hmmm...That’s a kinda pipe dream with this sentiment. I think my bias being a crypto fan boy makes me a perma-bear & I look for anything to make my counts fit that at times. I do keep the rules strict until invalidation. Definitely not perfect & I’ll slip a cog here or there LOL. This is what I kinda see may happen but the market will always do whatever it wants and humble even the haughtiest of a trader. I’ll be looking at all possibilities of course beyond  Elliott . Just an idea I’m long on currently. Tight stops. Mahalo & aloha!

Looking on the  RSI , we can see a reversal everytime when we hit an oversold situation, only despite on the last one. 
Furthermore we are forming a triangle, in which we are currently at the 4th wave. 
Hence we should see a small upwave and then a big last downwave due to the RSI! 

The small upwave:  






There are many different legit counts currently, but one of them is this one with quite perfekt  Elliott Wave  extentions. 







If we assume that our  Elliott Wave  is finished and we are now in a corrective  ABC  wave, than a normal correction to the 0.38 Fibonacci-level would be nearby at 7300$. 
Currently we have formed a  leading diagonal  and are waiting for a minor correction to a target between 6350$-6150$. 

The big downwave:  
At nearby 7300$ we should hit the major longterm resistance and heading downwards again. 
For the big downwards target please read my last TA I've written the last month ago. 




 

Personally my target is nearby 5000$ to 4700$, but that will be decided if I have more data.

Hello everybody, 

I made a post yesterday about the 6 month long  falling wedge bitcoin              entered. I want to explain a bit more of the fundamentals on why a  falling wedge  is a great way to see where price action has a good chance of going. 

If you don't know already, a  falling wedge  is a  bullish  signal. As it gets to the end the price starts moving more sideways and tighter into the point of the  wedge . When the candle sticks start to get towards the edge it is time to keep a close eye the price moving outside those lines.  

It's when the price exits on the top is the time to get into the trade. Be patient thought! Do not jump in the second the price is out. I like it to move a little further for confirmation because placing lines is not exact. 

Now the fun part about  falling wedge  breakouts is that the size of the end of the  wedge  is normally the size of the rally that happens. That is a lot of cheddar. If/when  bitcoin              breaks out we have a great chance of seeing all time highs being tested again quickly. 

Just my two cents on the issue.

 Bitcoin              is still in a downtrend and has pulled back to a swing level. We can see some  bearish  rejection of that level but nothing major. I will risk a small trade on this one as downside potential is quite big.

Hello everybody, 

I made a post yesterday about the 6 month long  falling wedge bitcoin              entered. I want to explain a bit more of the fundamentals on why a  falling wedge  is a great way to see where price action has a good chance of going. 

If you don't know already, a  falling wedge  is a  bullish  signal. As it gets to the end the price starts moving more sideways and tighter into the point of the  wedge . When the candle sticks start to get towards the edge it is time to keep a close eye the price moving outside those lines.  

It's when the price exits on the top is the time to get into the trade. Be patient thought! Do not jump in the second the price is out. I like it to move a little further for confirmation because placing lines is not exact. 

Now the fun part about  falling wedge  breakouts is that the size of the end of the  wedge  is normally the size of the rally that happens. That is a lot of cheddar. If/when  bitcoin              breaks out we have a great chance of seeing all time highs being tested again quickly. 

Just my two cents on the issue.

 Bitcoin              is still in a downtrend and has pulled back to a swing level. We can see some  bearish  rejection of that level but nothing major. I will risk a small trade on this one as downside potential is quite big.

Lol, This is really interesting spot 

As you can see in the main chart, we got rejected in last 12hrs (it was war!!!) 
However, bulls managed to defense $6,414 which was end of wave (4) 







So, I think it is more likely to go up. 
It is very suitable for both ""starting of long term uptrend(brown)"" and ""going to $7.3K first and down to HELL(blue)"" 
(Of course, I do support blue count, we need to go down more, maybe below $4.8K? :D) 

So, I will might put some long like below:

My original count was crazy so I stripped it down & redid it with a lot more simplicity so I could see the price action LOL. I have redone my counts so many times as the market shows us more of its intent. I was super  bearish  actually but decided to go against the grain for a little & have profited good thus far. I don’t believe the wave 5 will go too far or my extended 3rd theory will be invalidated unless it goes past 8000 hmmm...That’s a kinda pipe dream with this sentiment. I think my bias being a crypto fan boy makes me a perma-bear & I look for anything to make my counts fit that at times. I do keep the rules strict until invalidation. Definitely not perfect & I’ll slip a cog here or there LOL. This is what I kinda see may happen but the market will always do whatever it wants and humble even the haughtiest of a trader. I’ll be looking at all possibilities of course beyond  Elliott . Just an idea I’m long on currently. Tight stops. Mahalo & aloha!

Looking on the  RSI , we can see a reversal everytime when we hit an oversold situation, only despite on the last one. 
Furthermore we are forming a triangle, in which we are currently at the 4th wave. 
Hence we should see a small upwave and then a big last downwave due to the RSI! 

The small upwave:  






There are many different legit counts currently, but one of them is this one with quite perfekt  Elliott Wave  extentions. 







If we assume that our  Elliott Wave  is finished and we are now in a corrective  ABC  wave, than a normal correction to the 0.38 Fibonacci-level would be nearby at 7300$. 
Currently we have formed a  leading diagonal  and are waiting for a minor correction to a target between 6350$-6150$. 

The big downwave:  
At nearby 7300$ we should hit the major longterm resistance and heading downwards again. 
For the big downwards target please read my last TA I've written the last month ago. 




 

Personally my target is nearby 5000$ to 4700$, but that will be decided if I have more data.

Looking on the  RSI , we can see a reversal everytime when we hit an oversold situation, only despite on the last one. 
Furthermore we are forming a triangle, in which we are currently at the 4th wave. 
Hence we should see a small upwave and then a big last downwave due to the RSI! 

The small upwave:  






There are many different legit counts currently, but one of them is this one with quite perfekt  Elliott Wave  extentions. 







If we assume that our  Elliott Wave  is finished and we are now in a corrective  ABC  wave, than a normal correction to the 0.38 Fibonacci-level would be nearby at 7300$. 
Currently we have formed a  leading diagonal  and are waiting for a minor correction to a target between 6350$-6150$. 

The big downwave:  
At nearby 7300$ we should hit the major longterm resistance and heading downwards again. 
For the big downwards target please read my last TA I've written the last month ago. 




 

Personally my target is nearby 5000$ to 4700$, but that will be decided if I have more data.

Hello everybody, 

I made a post yesterday about the 6 month long  falling wedge bitcoin              entered. I want to explain a bit more of the fundamentals on why a  falling wedge  is a great way to see where price action has a good chance of going. 

If you don't know already, a  falling wedge  is a  bullish  signal. As it gets to the end the price starts moving more sideways and tighter into the point of the  wedge . When the candle sticks start to get towards the edge it is time to keep a close eye the price moving outside those lines.  

It's when the price exits on the top is the time to get into the trade. Be patient thought! Do not jump in the second the price is out. I like it to move a little further for confirmation because placing lines is not exact. 

Now the fun part about  falling wedge  breakouts is that the size of the end of the  wedge  is normally the size of the rally that happens. That is a lot of cheddar. If/when  bitcoin              breaks out we have a great chance of seeing all time highs being tested again quickly. 

Just my two cents on the issue.

 Bitcoin              is still in a downtrend and has pulled back to a swing level. We can see some  bearish  rejection of that level but nothing major. I will risk a small trade on this one as downside potential is quite big.

Lol, This is really interesting spot 

As you can see in the main chart, we got rejected in last 12hrs (it was war!!!) 
However, bulls managed to defense $6,414 which was end of wave (4) 







So, I think it is more likely to go up. 
It is very suitable for both ""starting of long term uptrend(brown)"" and ""going to $7.3K first and down to HELL(blue)"" 
(Of course, I do support blue count, we need to go down more, maybe below $4.8K? :D)

My original count was crazy so I stripped it down & redid it with a lot more simplicity so I could see the price action LOL. I have redone my counts so many times as the market shows us more of its intent. I was super  bearish  actually but decided to go against the grain for a little & have profited good thus far. I don’t believe the wave 5 will go too far or my extended 3rd theory will be invalidated unless it goes past 8000 hmmm...That’s a kinda pipe dream with this sentiment. I think my bias being a crypto fan boy makes me a perma-bear & I look for anything to make my counts fit that at times. I do keep the rules strict until invalidation. Definitely not perfect & I’ll slip a cog here or there LOL. This is what I kinda see may happen but the market will always do whatever it wants and humble even the haughtiest of a trader. I’ll be looking at all possibilities of course beyond  Elliott . Just an idea I’m long on currently. Tight stops. Mahalo & aloha!

My original count was crazy so I stripped it down & redid it with a lot more simplicity so I could see the price action LOL. I have redone my counts so many times as the market shows us more of its intent. I was super  bearish  actually but decided to go against the grain for a little & have profited good thus far. I don’t believe the wave 5 will go too far or my extended 3rd theory will be invalidated unless it goes past 8000 hmmm...That’s a kinda pipe dream with this sentiment. I think my bias being a crypto fan boy makes me a perma-bear & I look for anything to make my counts fit that at times. I do keep the rules strict until invalidation.

Looking on the  RSI , we can see a reversal everytime when we hit an oversold situation, only despite on the last one. 
Furthermore we are forming a triangle, in which we are currently at the 4th wave. 
Hence we should see a small upwave and then a big last downwave due to the RSI! 

The small upwave:  






There are many different legit counts currently, but one of them is this one with quite perfekt  Elliott Wave  extentions. 







If we assume that our  Elliott Wave  is finished and we are now in a corrective  ABC  wave, than a normal correction to the 0.38 Fibonacci-level would be nearby at 7300$. 
Currently we have formed a  leading diagonal  and are waiting for a minor correction to a target between 6350$-6150$. 

The big downwave:  
At nearby 7300$ we should hit the major longterm resistance and heading downwards again. 
For the big downwards target please read my last TA I've written the last month ago. 




 

Personally my target is nearby 5000$ to 4700$, but that will be decided if I have more data.

Hello everybody, 

I made a post yesterday about the 6 month long  falling wedge bitcoin -0.49%  entered. I want to explain a bit more of the fundamentals on why a  falling wedge  is a great way to see where price action has a good chance of going. 

If you don't know already, a  falling wedge  is a  bullish  signal. As it gets to the end the price starts moving more sideways and tighter into the point of the  wedge . When the candle sticks start to get towards the edge it is time to keep a close eye the price moving outside those lines.  

It's when the price exits on the top is the time to get into the trade. Be patient thought! Do not jump in the second the price is out. I like it to move a little further for confirmation because placing lines is not exact. 

Now the fun part about  falling wedge  breakouts is that the size of the end of the  wedge  is normally the size of the rally that happens. That is a lot of cheddar. If/when  bitcoin -0.49%  breaks out we have a great chance of seeing all time highs being tested again quickly. 

Just my two cents on the issue.

 Bitcoin -0.53%  is still in a downtrend and has pulled back to a swing level. We can see some  bearish  rejection of that level but nothing major. I will risk a small trade on this one as downside potential is quite big.

Hello everybody, 

I made a post yesterday about the 6 month long  falling wedge bitcoin -0.54%  entered. I want to explain a bit more of the fundamentals on why a  falling wedge  is a great way to see where price action has a good chance of going. 

If you don't know already, a  falling wedge  is a  bullish  signal. As it gets to the end the price starts moving more sideways and tighter into the point of the  wedge . When the candle sticks start to get towards the edge it is time to keep a close eye the price moving outside those lines.  

It's when the price exits on the top is the time to get into the trade. Be patient thought! Do not jump in the second the price is out. I like it to move a little further for confirmation because placing lines is not exact. 

Now the fun part about  falling wedge  breakouts is that the size of the end of the  wedge  is normally the size of the rally that happens. That is a lot of cheddar. If/when  bitcoin -0.54%  breaks out we have a great chance of seeing all time highs being tested again quickly. 

Just my two cents on the issue.

 Bitcoin -0.54%  is still in a downtrend and has pulled back to a swing level. We can see some  bearish  rejection of that level but nothing major. I will risk a small trade on this one as downside potential is quite big.

Lol, This is really interesting spot 

As you can see in the main chart, we got rejected in last 12hrs (it was war!!!) 
However, bulls managed to defense $6,414 which was end of wave (4) 







So, I think it is more likely to go up. 
It is very suitable for both ""starting of long term uptrend(brown)"" and ""going to $7.3K first and down to HELL(blue)"" 
(Of course, I do support blue count, we need to go down more, maybe below $4.8K? :D)

I have redone my counts so many times as the market shows us more of its intent. I was super  bearish  actually but decided to go against the grain for a little & have profited good thus far. I don’t believe the wave 5 will go too far or my extended 3rd theory will be invalidated unless it goes past 8000 hmmm...That’s a kinda pipe dream with this sentiment. I think my bias being a crypto fan boy makes me a perma-bear & I look for anything to make my counts fit that at times. I do keep the rules strict until invalidation.

Looking on the  RSI , we can see a reversal everytime when we hit an oversold situation, only despite on the last one. 
Furthermore we are forming a triangle, in which we are currently at the 4th wave. 
Hence we should see a small upwave and then a big last downwave due to the RSI! 

The small upwave:  






There are many different legit counts currently, but one of them is this one with quite perfekt  Elliott Wave  extentions. 







If we assume that our  Elliott Wave  is finished and we are now in a corrective  ABC  wave, than a normal correction to the 0.38 Fibonacci-level would be nearby at 7300$. 
Currently we have formed a  leading diagonal  and are waiting for a minor correction to a target between 6350$-6150$. 

The big downwave:  
At nearby 7300$ we should hit the major longterm resistance and heading downwards again. 
For the big downwards target please read my last TA I've written the last month ago. 




 

Personally my target is nearby 5000$ to 4700$, but that will be decided if I have more data.

Looking on the  RSI , we can see a reversal everytime when we hit an oversold situation, only despite on the last one. 
Furthermore we are forming a triangle, in which we are currently at the 4th wave. 
Hence we should see a small upwave and then a big last downwave due to the RSI! 

The small upwave:  






There are many different legit counts currently, but one of them is this one with quite perfekt  Elliott Wave  extentions. 







If we assume that our  Elliott Wave  is finished and we are now in a corrective  ABC  wave, than a normal correction to the 0.38 Fibonacci-level would be nearby at 7300$. 
Currently we have formed a  leading diagonal  and are waiting for a minor correction to a target between 6350$-6150$. 

The big downwave:  
At nearby 7300$ we should hit the major longterm resistance and heading downwards again. 
For the big downwards target please read my last TA I've written the last month ago. 




 

Personally my target is nearby 5000$ to 4700$, but that will be decided if I have more data.

Hello everybody, 

I made a post yesterday about the 6 month long  falling wedge bitcoin -0.40%  entered. I want to explain a bit more of the fundamentals on why a  falling wedge  is a great way to see where price action has a good chance of going. 

If you don't know already, a  falling wedge  is a  bullish  signal. As it gets to the end the price starts moving more sideways and tighter into the point of the  wedge . When the candle sticks start to get towards the edge it is time to keep a close eye the price moving outside those lines.  

It's when the price exits on the top is the time to get into the trade. Be patient thought! Do not jump in the second the price is out. I like it to move a little further for confirmation because placing lines is not exact. 

Now the fun part about  falling wedge  breakouts is that the size of the end of the  wedge  is normally the size of the rally that happens. That is a lot of cheddar. If/when  bitcoin -0.40%  breaks out we have a great chance of seeing all time highs being tested again quickly. 

Just my two cents on the issue.

 Bitcoin              is still in a downtrend and has pulled back to a swing level. We can see some  bearish  rejection of that level but nothing major. I will risk a small trade on this one as downside potential is quite big.

As you can see in the main chart, we got rejected in last 12hrs (it was war!!!) 
However, bulls managed to defense $6,414 which was end of wave (4) 







So, I think it is more likely to go up. 
It is very suitable for both ""starting of long term uptrend(brown)"" and ""going to $7.3K first and down to HELL(blue)""

My original count was crazy so I stripped it down & redid it with a lot more simplicity so I could see the price action LOL. I have redone my counts so many times as the market shows us more of its intent. I was super  bearish  actually but decided to go against the grain for a little & have profited good thus far. I don’t believe the wave 5 will go too far or my extended 3rd theory will be invalidated unless it goes past 8000 hmmm...That’s a kinda pipe dream with this sentiment. I think my bias being a crypto fan boy makes me a perma-bear & I look for anything to make my counts fit that at times. I do keep the rules strict until invalidation.

 Bitcoin -0.40%  is still in a downtrend and has pulled back to a swing level. We can see some  bearish  rejection of that level but nothing major. I will risk a small trade on this one as downside potential is quite big.

Lol, This is really interesting spot 

As you can see in the main chart, we got rejected in last 12hrs (it was war!!!) 
However, bulls managed to defense $6,414 which was end of wave (4) 







So, I think it is more likely to go up. 
It is very suitable for both ""starting of long term uptrend(brown)"" and ""going to $7.3K first and down to HELL(blue)"" 
(Of course, I do support blue count, we need to go down more, maybe below $4.8K? :D)

My original count was crazy so I stripped it down & redid it with a lot more simplicity so I could see the price action LOL. I have redone my counts so many times as the market shows us more of its intent. I was super  bearish  actually but decided to go against the grain for a little & have profited good thus far. I don’t believe the wave 5 will go too far or my extended 3rd theory will be invalidated unless it goes past 8000 hmmm...That’s a kinda pipe dream with this sentiment. I think my bias being a crypto fan boy makes me a perma-bear & I look for anything to make my counts fit that at times. I do keep the rules strict until invalidation.

Looking on the  RSI , we can see a reversal everytime when we hit an oversold situation, only despite on the last one. 
Furthermore we are forming a triangle, in which we are currently at the 4th wave. 
Hence we should see a small upwave and then a big last downwave due to the RSI! 

The small upwave:  






There are many different legit counts currently, but one of them is this one with quite perfekt  Elliott Wave  extentions. 







If we assume that our  Elliott Wave  is finished and we are now in a corrective  ABC  wave, than a normal correction to the 0.38 Fibonacci-level would be nearby at 7300$. 
Currently we have formed a  leading diagonal  and are waiting for a minor correction to a target between 6350$-6150$. 

The big downwave:  
At nearby 7300$ we should hit the major longterm resistance and heading downwards again. 
For the big downwards target please read my last TA I've written the last month ago. 




 

Personally my target is nearby 5000$ to 4700$, but that will be decided if I have more data.

Hello everybody, 

I made a post yesterday about the 6 month long  falling wedge bitcoin -0.49%  entered. I want to explain a bit more of the fundamentals on why a  falling wedge  is a great way to see where price action has a good chance of going. 

If you don't know already, a  falling wedge  is a  bullish  signal. As it gets to the end the price starts moving more sideways and tighter into the point of the  wedge . When the candle sticks start to get towards the edge it is time to keep a close eye the price moving outside those lines.  

It's when the price exits on the top is the time to get into the trade. Be patient thought! Do not jump in the second the price is out. I like it to move a little further for confirmation because placing lines is not exact. 

Now the fun part about  falling wedge  breakouts is that the size of the end of the  wedge  is normally the size of the rally that happens. That is a lot of cheddar. If/when  bitcoin -0.49%  breaks out we have a great chance of seeing all time highs being tested again quickly. 

Just my two cents on the issue.

Hello everybody, 

I made a post yesterday about the 6 month long  falling wedge bitcoin -0.61%  entered. I want to explain a bit more of the fundamentals on why a  falling wedge  is a great way to see where price action has a good chance of going. 

If you don't know already, a  falling wedge  is a  bullish  signal. As it gets to the end the price starts moving more sideways and tighter into the point of the  wedge . When the candle sticks start to get towards the edge it is time to keep a close eye the price moving outside those lines.  

It's when the price exits on the top is the time to get into the trade. Be patient thought! Do not jump in the second the price is out. I like it to move a little further for confirmation because placing lines is not exact. 

Now the fun part about  falling wedge  breakouts is that the size of the end of the  wedge  is normally the size of the rally that happens. That is a lot of cheddar. If/when  bitcoin -0.61%  breaks out we have a great chance of seeing all time highs being tested again quickly. 

Just my two cents on the issue.

 Bitcoin              is still in a downtrend and has pulled back to a swing level. We can see some  bearish  rejection of that level but nothing major. I will risk a small trade on this one as downside potential is quite big.

Lol, This is really interesting spot 

As you can see in the main chart, we got rejected in last 12hrs (it was war!!!) 
However, bulls managed to defense $6,414 which was end of wave (4) 







So, I think it is more likely to go up. 
It is very suitable for both ""starting of long term uptrend(brown)"" and ""going to $7.3K first and down to HELL(blue)"" 
(Of course, I do support blue count, we need to go down more, maybe below $4.8K? :D) 

So, I will might put some long like below:

My original count was crazy so I stripped it down & redid it with a lot more simplicity so I could see the price action LOL. I have redone my counts so many times as the market shows us more of its intent. I was super  bearish  actually but decided to go against the grain for a little & have profited good thus far. I don’t believe the wave 5 will go too far or my extended 3rd theory will be invalidated unless it goes past 8000 hmmm...That’s a kinda pipe dream with this sentiment. I think my bias being a crypto fan boy makes me a perma-bear & I look for anything to make my counts fit that at times. I do keep the rules strict until invalidation. Definitely not perfect & I’ll slip a cog here or there LOL. This is what I kinda see may happen but the market will always do whatever it wants and humble even the haughtiest of a trader. I’ll be looking at all possibilities of course beyond  Elliott . Just an idea I’m long on currently. Tight stops. Mahalo & aloha!

Looking on the  RSI , we can see a reversal everytime when we hit an oversold situation, only despite on the last one. 
Furthermore we are forming a triangle, in which we are currently at the 4th wave. 
Hence we should see a small upwave and then a big last downwave due to the RSI! 

The small upwave:  






There are many different legit counts currently, but one of them is this one with quite perfekt  Elliott Wave  extentions. 







If we assume that our  Elliott Wave  is finished and we are now in a corrective  ABC  wave, than a normal correction to the 0.38 Fibonacci-level would be nearby at 7300$. 
Currently we have formed a  leading diagonal  and are waiting for a minor correction to a target between 6350$-6150$. 

The big downwave:  
At nearby 7300$ we should hit the major longterm resistance and heading downwards again. 
For the big downwards target please read my last TA I've written the last month ago.

My original count was crazy so I stripped it down & redid it with a lot more simplicity so I could see the price action LOL. I have redone my counts so many times as the market shows us more of its intent. I was super  bearish  actually but decided to go against the grain for a little & have profited good thus far. I don’t believe the wave 5 will go too far or my extended 3rd theory will be invalidated unless it goes past 8000 hmmm...That’s a kinda pipe dream with this sentiment. I think my bias being a crypto fan boy makes me a perma-bear & I look for anything to make my counts fit that at times. I do keep the rules strict until invalidation. Definitely not perfect & I’ll slip a cog here or there LOL. This is what I kinda see may happen but the market will always do whatever it wants and humble even the haughtiest of a trader. I’ll be looking at all possibilities of course beyond  Elliott . Just an idea I’m long on currently. Tight stops. Mahalo & aloha!

Looking on the  RSI , we can see a reversal everytime when we hit an oversold situation, only despite on the last one. 
Furthermore we are forming a triangle, in which we are currently at the 4th wave. 
Hence we should see a small upwave and then a big last downwave due to the RSI! 

The small upwave:  






There are many different legit counts currently, but one of them is this one with quite perfekt  Elliott Wave  extentions. 







If we assume that our  Elliott Wave  is finished and we are now in a corrective  ABC  wave, than a normal correction to the 0.38 Fibonacci-level would be nearby at 7300$. 
Currently we have formed a  leading diagonal  and are waiting for a minor correction to a target between 6350$-6150$. 

The big downwave:  
At nearby 7300$ we should hit the major longterm resistance and heading downwards again. 
For the big downwards target please read my last TA I've written the last month ago. 




 

Personally my target is nearby 5000$ to 4700$, but that will be decided if I have more data.

Hello everybody, 

I made a post yesterday about the 6 month long  falling wedge bitcoin -0.64%  entered. I want to explain a bit more of the fundamentals on why a  falling wedge  is a great way to see where price action has a good chance of going. 

If you don't know already, a  falling wedge  is a  bullish  signal. As it gets to the end the price starts moving more sideways and tighter into the point of the  wedge . When the candle sticks start to get towards the edge it is time to keep a close eye the price moving outside those lines.  

It's when the price exits on the top is the time to get into the trade. Be patient thought! Do not jump in the second the price is out. I like it to move a little further for confirmation because placing lines is not exact. 

Now the fun part about  falling wedge  breakouts is that the size of the end of the  wedge  is normally the size of the rally that happens. That is a lot of cheddar. If/when  bitcoin -0.64%  breaks out we have a great chance of seeing all time highs being tested again quickly. 

Just my two cents on the issue.

 Bitcoin -0.64%  is still in a downtrend and has pulled back to a swing level. We can see some  bearish  rejection of that level but nothing major. I will risk a small trade on this one as downside potential is quite big.

Lol, This is really interesting spot 

As you can see in the main chart, we got rejected in last 12hrs (it was war!!!) 
However, bulls managed to defense $6,414 which was end of wave (4) 







So, I think it is more likely to go up. 
It is very suitable for both ""starting of long term uptrend(brown)"" and ""going to $7.3K first and down to HELL(blue)"" 
(Of course, I do support blue count, we need to go down more, maybe below $4.8K? :D) 

So, I will might put some long like below:

Hello everybody, 

I made a post yesterday about the 6 month long  falling wedge bitcoin              entered. I want to explain a bit more of the fundamentals on why a  falling wedge  is a great way to see where price action has a good chance of going. 

If you don't know already, a  falling wedge  is a  bullish  signal. As it gets to the end the price starts moving more sideways and tighter into the point of the  wedge . When the candle sticks start to get towards the edge it is time to keep a close eye the price moving outside those lines.  

It's when the price exits on the top is the time to get into the trade. Be patient thought! Do not jump in the second the price is out. I like it to move a little further for confirmation because placing lines is not exact. 

Now the fun part about  falling wedge  breakouts is that the size of the end of the  wedge  is normally the size of the rally that happens. That is a lot of cheddar. If/when  bitcoin              breaks out we have a great chance of seeing all time highs being tested again quickly. 

Just my two cents on the issue.

 Bitcoin              is still in a downtrend and has pulled back to a swing level. We can see some  bearish  rejection of that level but nothing major. I will risk a small trade on this one as downside potential is quite big.

Lol, This is really interesting spot 

As you can see in the main chart, we got rejected in last 12hrs (it was war!!!) 
However, bulls managed to defense $6,414 which was end of wave (4) 







So, I think it is more likely to go up. 
It is very suitable for both ""starting of long term uptrend(brown)"" and ""going to $7.3K first and down to HELL(blue)"" 
(Of course, I do support blue count, we need to go down more, maybe below $4.8K? :D) 

So, I will might put some long like below:

My original count was crazy so I stripped it down & redid it with a lot more simplicity so I could see the price action LOL. I have redone my counts so many times as the market shows us more of its intent. I was super  bearish  actually but decided to go against the grain for a little & have profited good thus far. I don’t believe the wave 5 will go too far or my extended 3rd theory will be invalidated unless it goes past 8000 hmmm...That’s a kinda pipe dream with this sentiment. I think my bias being a crypto fan boy makes me a perma-bear & I look for anything to make my counts fit that at times. I do keep the rules strict until invalidation. Definitely not perfect & I’ll slip a cog here or there LOL. This is what I kinda see may happen but the market will always do whatever it wants and humble even the haughtiest of a trader. I’ll be looking at all possibilities of course beyond  Elliott . Just an idea I’m long on currently. Tight stops. Mahalo & aloha!

Looking on the  RSI , we can see a reversal everytime when we hit an oversold situation, only despite on the last one. 
Furthermore we are forming a triangle, in which we are currently at the 4th wave. 
Hence we should see a small upwave and then a big last downwave due to the RSI! 

The small upwave:  






There are many different legit counts currently, but one of them is this one with quite perfekt  Elliott Wave  extentions. 







If we assume that our  Elliott Wave  is finished and we are now in a corrective  ABC  wave, than a normal correction to the 0.38 Fibonacci-level would be nearby at 7300$. 
Currently we have formed a  leading diagonal  and are waiting for a minor correction to a target between 6350$-6150$. 

The big downwave:  
At nearby 7300$ we should hit the major longterm resistance and heading downwards again. 
For the big downwards target please read my last TA I've written the last month ago. 




 

Personally my target is nearby 5000$ to 4700$, but that will be decided if I have more data.

Looking on the  RSI , we can see a reversal everytime when we hit an oversold situation, only despite on the last one. 
Furthermore we are forming a triangle, in which we are currently at the 4th wave. 
Hence we should see a small upwave and then a big last downwave due to the RSI! 

The small upwave:  






There are many different legit counts currently, but one of them is this one with quite perfekt  Elliott Wave  extentions. 







If we assume that our  Elliott Wave  is finished and we are now in a corrective  ABC  wave, than a normal correction to the 0.38 Fibonacci-level would be nearby at 7300$. 
Currently we have formed a  leading diagonal  and are waiting for a minor correction to a target between 6350$-6150$. 

The big downwave:  
At nearby 7300$ we should hit the major longterm resistance and heading downwards again. 
For the big downwards target please read my last TA I've written the last month ago. 




 

Personally my target is nearby 5000$ to 4700$, but that will be decided if I have more data.

We all know  Bitcoin -0.65%  is back! However, it will stay in the  resistance zone  from 6520-6540 because India's  central bank  is directing all banks to stop providing any services related to crypto but the country's finance ministry has not given the opinion yet. Investors still lack confidence.

Hello everybody, 

I made a post yesterday about the 6 month long  falling wedge bitcoin -0.65%  entered. I want to explain a bit more of the fundamentals on why a  falling wedge  is a great way to see where price action has a good chance of going. 

If you don't know already, a  falling wedge  is a  bullish  signal. As it gets to the end the price starts moving more sideways and tighter into the point of the  wedge . When the candle sticks start to get towards the edge it is time to keep a close eye the price moving outside those lines.  

It's when the price exits on the top is the time to get into the trade. Be patient thought! Do not jump in the second the price is out. I like it to move a little further for confirmation because placing lines is not exact. 

Now the fun part about  falling wedge  breakouts is that the size of the end of the  wedge  is normally the size of the rally that happens. That is a lot of cheddar. If/when  bitcoin -0.65%  breaks out we have a great chance of seeing all time highs being tested again quickly. 

Just my two cents on the issue.

 Bitcoin -0.65%  is still in a downtrend and has pulled back to a swing level. We can see some  bearish  rejection of that level but nothing major. I will risk a small trade on this one as downside potential is quite big.

Lol, This is really interesting spot 

As you can see in the main chart, we got rejected in last 12hrs (it was war!!!) 
However, bulls managed to defense $6,414 which was end of wave (4) 







So, I think it is more likely to go up. 
It is very suitable for both ""starting of long term uptrend(brown)"" and ""going to $7.3K first and down to HELL(blue)"" 
(Of course, I do support blue count, we need to go down more, maybe below $4.8K? :D) 

So, I will might put some long like below:

My original count was crazy so I stripped it down & redid it with a lot more simplicity so I could see the price action LOL. I have redone my counts so many times as the market shows us more of its intent. I was super  bearish  actually but decided to go against the grain for a little & have profited good thus far. I don’t believe the wave 5 will go too far or my extended 3rd theory will be invalidated unless it goes past 8000 hmmm...That’s a kinda pipe dream with this sentiment. I think my bias being a crypto fan boy makes me a perma-bear & I look for anything to make my counts fit that at times. I do keep the rules strict until invalidation. Definitely not perfect & I’ll slip a cog here or there LOL. This is what I kinda see may happen but the market will always do whatever it wants and humble even the haughtiest of a trader. I’ll be looking at all possibilities of course beyond  Elliott . Just an idea I’m long on currently. Tight stops. Mahalo & aloha!
