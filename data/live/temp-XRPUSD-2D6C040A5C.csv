1530891120.0,rgeddes,Ripple - Going Down Before It Goes Up - This Weekend!,"
XRP has been a bargain at current levels relative to how it normally trades. 

We have been in a bear cycle for some time and it now seems like we are building to break out of it. 

In today's trading I expect to hit a low around .45 before we begin building again and challenge some of the other resistance in the .50 range. 

This weekend should bring us to .50 but it looks like we will dip our toes into the .45 range before we move on up. 

Short term pain for long term gain.  Ripple is the third biggest crypto and one of the few that has real upside potential!
