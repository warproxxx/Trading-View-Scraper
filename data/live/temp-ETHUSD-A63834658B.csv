Hey guys, hope you're aaaalll doing fine! ;) ETH is right now in a clear tightening pattern with the 4H Lower Highs of 480 and the  Double Bottom  at 450.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, it was a healthy consolidation, with upholding the previous bullflag, but surely inside the equilibrium the bears were stronger with  double bottom . Eventually it is going to depend on big brother  Bitcoin -0.46% . In the direct correlation of  ETH/BTC             , we're still trying to maintain the 0.07 as support. 

If  Bitcoin -0.46%  manages to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs. 

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)  

About myself: Global citizen & early  Bitcoin -0.46%  adopter from Germany. I invested in the 2nd rally from 50 to 1.000 Dollars in  BTC -0.46% .
