Looks like a spike due to hype, nothing really impressive here.  Double bottom  PSych level, shoot to resistance, probably will see  another run low. as stated in previous chat, 4.9k.

Wave 4 almost complete and about to start that final wave C correction to complete the  ABC . Bottom target for C wave is  .33-.30 in my opinion.
