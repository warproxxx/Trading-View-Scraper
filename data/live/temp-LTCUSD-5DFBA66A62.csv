Hey guys, just like I've been posting yesterday, we have broken the equilibrium in the 4H  bearish  together with grandpa  BTC 0.89%  & reached the previous lows at 73,3 with more than 6% profit potential .  

So: If you played this like I suggested: Good for you! Now it might be time to take profit (if you haven't so far) & wait for further price action on  Bitcoin 0.89% . We're right now highly oversold in the 4h & Daily with  BTC 0.89%  , and grandpa still gives the direction.  

If you don't want to miss equilibrium breaks next time: Please follow me & watch my daily videos! (description in my status). I wish you a good trading! ;)  

About myself: Global citizen & early  Bitcoin 0.89%  adopter from Germany. I invested in the 2nd rally from 50 to 1.000 Dollars in  BTC 0.89% .
