1530147885.0,johny_button,Monero to make first UP run ! step up to the plate,"
Good day trader enthusiasts, I am the real Johny Button the Elephant hunter and i have a nice scenario to share, 

Looking at Coin Market Cap the crypto market cap has hit equal lows for this year at 245  ish              billion. Thats a  support level , and if the market sways this will break and plummet...but i have a good feeling this wont happen, as the industry news is positive, institutions are coming in, and SEC is working so this can happen. . . everything is positive in the world, the revolution is about to get started Im feeling. 

So looking across all majors, Monero xmr is making some moves to the possible upside. It has triggered some indicators: 
1. Made this triangle / wedgy thingy (white lines), tagged 3 times the lower support, 2 times on the top resistance 
2. On this last dip the past 2 months we have broken some key resistance (pink lines), making a ABCDE, which made this 3rd tag on this lower larger support (white line) 
3. come to a critical test point . . . the 21EMA (blue line), and the previous high.  
4.  MACD  looks good as being oversold, showing 3 down waves, and crossed over for an up move 
5.  RSI  has risen to the good level of a climb signal 

So if we break the 21EMA and this last high it means that the last people that bought at this high (before the recent dip in the last days) will either want to cash out and break even, or stay in as new buyers join the race. This second scenario means the public thinks it is time to rise. 

That will mean a drive up to the 55EMA (white  EMA  line), to test the C wave level next . . . and if that breaks we will make a tag to the large upper resistance of the triangle wedgy thing . . . and if that break we will keep playing the test level game. Optimistic?  

So there you have it, lets start at the first point and see if this level breaks. Monero is a market leader i find in these market dip situations. i dont know why right now, but i see it make first moves in the past before  btc             , and before others, which means i am watching this carefully to see what pans out. 

As for buying i will wait a while to see if my 21EMA level and yellow line break before entering anything. First swing for that wave C level at that point. 

Yours sincerely, 
Johny Button
