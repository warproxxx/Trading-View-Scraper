1530275249.0,JohnnyPurtoy98,XMRUSD - Bearish moves coming!,"
The price has broken out the bottom ( support level ) of the  descending triangle , this has given a massive signal for further  bearish  moves to be taking place, cryptocurrencies are no longer being hyped up as much as they used to causing the currencies to lose momentum, I believe that these currencies would be falling for a while yet, but I do believe these currencies would move up later in the future as they are fully developed and understood and used by many more. Once these cryptocurrencies start being used more I believe their price would start to rise at a substantial rate.
