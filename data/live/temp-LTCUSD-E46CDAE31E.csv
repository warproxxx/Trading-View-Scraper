The price zone of $ 94-113 was a critical zone that gave hope for LTC. Having broken through this zone, there is only one question: 
1. The fall will continue right now at a price of $ 42-48 
or 
2. There will be a rollback in the zone of 94-113 $ (and if buyers are very trying there is a chance to test the  trend line  in the price zone of 120-130 $) 
I'll post more details in new ideas with less timeframe

The rate of Litecoin is still in flat. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  LTCUSD -2.98% . 
The hard work of a trader teaches us to wait for our situation. Today we stick to our forecast of a slight increase in the rate of Litecoin to $ 87. 
Naturally, we do not plan to open deals today, because other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  LTCUSD -2.98%  rate will rise from $ 78 to $ 87. 
2. The  LTCUSD -2.98%  rate will decrease from $ 78 to $ 70. 
An alternative scenario: 
Litecoin rate may be in flat for another day.

So  LTCUSD -2.98%  appears to be in the B-wave of an ABC-correction after it's first wave downwards of the last wave 5 of a higher degree. We completed a clean impulse wave up from $75 to a little over $80 as a wave A, and are now in a corrective B-wave inside a corrective wave 2. At least, that's what it looks like at the moment. Trading corrections is tricky enough as it is, but trading a correction in a correction is definitely a moment to stay out of the market as far as I'm concerned. 

For the time being, I'm happy to let this B-wave unfold and see what it ends up like. After that, we'll have one more move upwards I think to the area of $82,50 - $85 before we go into the third wave of wave 5 on a higher degree which should get interesting and full of trading opportunities. Remember, the trend is your friend, and you trade corrections at your own risk. The present B-wave could unfold into a variety of shapes, after all. 

Time to sit on my hands and wait!
