2 hours ago




We had got stopped out of the last trade but this one is a much safer set up! So let's talk about what's I'm seeing!  

First this is the currency market been  bearish  for a while and Markets don't trend one way! It's a combination of both  Bullish  and  Bearish  that makes the market moves.  

1. Previously we had an inverted  head and shoulders  at the end of June that spiked the market to .52 High then it was retracing on those levels!  

                 - There was a  Double top  but I didn't post it because I had a feeling that this market is not  bearish  so this move wouldn't have been significant enough for the risk that ensure with it.  

Now let's examine why we are heading up! 

1.  Weekly timeframe  been suggesting a  bullish  movement from the market 
    - We had an  hammer  last week! At support which had suggested the turning point in the market and that is the reason why I have not been selling XRPUSD  
    - This week is suggesting that we could get a  Bullish  engulfing! And putting those two together we should get a morning start at support on the  weekly timeframe .  

2. On June 29th the market gave the first indication on the  Daily timeframe  that a change was coming! by rejecting the downside with a  Hammer .  
        - Past couple days been a really shitty market but today we have gotten a morning start and I expect a continuation to the upside.  

3.  Double bottom  on the lower time frames are suggesting the change in the trend! and we should not be heading up.
