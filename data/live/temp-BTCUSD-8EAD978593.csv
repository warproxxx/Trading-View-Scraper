Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC 0.02%  stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000 
!! killerFckr is RED people. Still RED. 

Stay calm, trade wisely.  

Cryptocholics out, peace out!

Please put your pride aside and make money will you can while the market continues to tank before the regulators come in. WE ARE IN A BEAR MARKET! Let us not keep falling for the moon reversal that  Bitcoin 0.02%  keeps fooling us with!

Hello followers and other TradingView (TV) users! 
Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin 0.02%  price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin 0.02%  want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH 0.25% ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin 0.02% , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin 0.02%  reversal! In this area on the  BTC 0.02%  chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

The  Bitcoin 0.02%  rate is still in flat. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  BTCUSD 0.02% . 
Bitcoin 0.02%  rate is still in uncertainty: on one hand, it cannot stand falling and on the other buyers do not pour money into the market. In such trading conditions, it is better not to make  Bitcoin 0.02%  transactions. 
Today we are on the side of bulls; we stick to our forecast of a slight increase in the  Bitcoin 0.02%  rate to $ 6550. However, other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.02%  will rise from $ 6100 to $ 6550. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.02%  will decrease from $ 6100 to $ 5500.

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also!

Hello followers and other TradingView (TV) users! 
Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin 0.02%  price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin 0.02%  want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH 0.25% ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin 0.02% , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin 0.02%  reversal! In this area on the  BTC 0.02%  chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also!

Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC 0.04%  stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000 
!! killerFckr is RED people. Still RED. 

Stay calm, trade wisely.  

Cryptocholics out, peace out!

The price is back again near the 6,000 level after being rejected yesterday on two strong  bearish  1H candles ( Engulfing , Three Outside Down on Highs/Lows = -33.0071, B/BP = -85.7219). 4H remains within a  Triangle pattern  ( STOCH  = 45.730, Williams = -46.245) which breaks id 5,928.28 is crossed. 1D remains a standard Channel Down ( RSI  = 33.875,  MACD  = -370.000) which steadily looks for a Lower Low (Highs/Lows = -182.5658). TP = 5,617.4 (1W MA100) intact. See how a new Channel Down has emerged, which primarily rejected any upside attempts on 6,340.50 and 6,261.10.

As I stated in my last published idea,  Bitcoin              is falling and falling fast. Please put your pride aside and make money will you can while the market continues to tank before the regulators come in. WE ARE IN A BEAR MARKET! Let us not keep falling for the moon reversal that  Bitcoin              keeps fooling us with! 

Now, with that said- lets get down to the numbers 
Simply put,  check out the dark red channel that will serve as the red carpet arrival to  Bitcoins              $5400 mark.  
WARNING;;; there is a heavy chance that we will see some form of resistance at these places: 
     - $6000 mark- 
     -$5900 mark- 
     - $5780 mark-  
All 3 of these marks (marked in orange on the chart) stand as one of the swings that formed a resistance to the price continuing its progression within this bear market.  

+++PLEASE do not fall for the bear trap at these reversal levels+++ 

In closing, (HERE IS A LITTLE BACKGROUND) ::: I want you guys to know that I am an avid believer in the bright future of cryptocurrency. I was once a proud ""HODLER"" myself until  I couldn't take checking my blockfolio every two days to see another 2k down the drain. Just like you I was convinced that, ""you don't take a loss until you sell"" - which is true. However, I have been shorting the market since the 7.8k mark and have made my losses back plus a healthy amount on the side. With this large amount of extra money in my trading account, I can now buy back the market once the regulators come- until then... I will be collecting and hope  you guys decide to as well.

June 26 close (using UTC timezone) shows that  MACD  (12,26,9) is experiencing a  bullish divergence ; it is a small one and so I don't have a lot of conviction at this stage. Separately, I use  MACD  (19,38,13) which is optimised for the Jan14-Jan18 period; this modified  MACD  still flashes a ""SELL"" signal.

Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC 0.04%  stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000 
!! killerFckr is RED people. Still RED. 

Stay calm, trade wisely.  

Cryptocholics out, peace out!

Please put your pride aside and make money will you can while the market continues to tank before the regulators come in. WE ARE IN A BEAR MARKET! Let us not keep falling for the moon reversal that  Bitcoin 0.04%  keeps fooling us with!

Hello followers and other TradingView (TV) users! 
Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin 0.04%  price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin 0.04%  want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH 0.25% ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin 0.04% , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin 0.04%  reversal! In this area on the  BTC 0.04%  chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also!

The  Bitcoin 0.04%  rate is still in flat.

Bitcoin 0.04%  rate is still in uncertainty: on one hand, it cannot stand falling and on the other buyers do not pour money into the market. In such trading conditions, it is better not to make  Bitcoin 0.04%  transactions. 
Today we are on the side of bulls; we stick to our forecast of a slight increase in the  Bitcoin 0.04%  rate to $ 6550. However, other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.04%  will rise from $ 6100 to $ 6550.

Hello followers and other TradingView (TV) users! 
Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin 0.08%  price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin 0.08%  want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH 0.25% ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin 0.08% , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin 0.08%  reversal! In this area on the  BTC 0.08%  chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also!

The  Bitcoin 0.08%  rate is still in flat.

Bitcoin 0.08%  rate is still in uncertainty: on one hand, it cannot stand falling and on the other buyers do not pour money into the market. In such trading conditions, it is better not to make  Bitcoin 0.08%  transactions. 
Today we are on the side of bulls; we stick to our forecast of a slight increase in the  Bitcoin 0.08%  rate to $ 6550. However, other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.08%  will rise from $ 6100 to $ 6550.

Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC 0.08%  stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000 
!! killerFckr is RED people. Still RED. 

Stay calm, trade wisely.  

Cryptocholics out, peace out!

As I stated in my last published idea,  Bitcoin 0.08%  is falling and falling fast. Please put your pride aside and make money will you can while the market continues to tank before the regulators come in. WE ARE IN A BEAR MARKET! Let us not keep falling for the moon reversal that  Bitcoin 0.08%  keeps fooling us with! 

Now, with that said- lets get down to the numbers 
Simply put,  check out the dark red channel that will serve as the red carpet arrival to  Bitcoins 0.08%  $5400 mark.  
WARNING;;; there is a heavy chance that we will see some form of resistance at these places: 
     - $6000 mark- 
     -$5900 mark- 
     - $5780 mark-  
All 3 of these marks (marked in orange on the chart) stand as one of the swings that formed a resistance to the price continuing its progression within this bear market.  

+++PLEASE do not fall for the bear trap at these reversal levels+++ 

In closing, (HERE IS A LITTLE BACKGROUND) ::: I want you guys to know that I am an avid believer in the bright future of cryptocurrency. I was once a proud ""HODLER"" myself until  I couldn't take checking my blockfolio every two days to see another 2k down the drain. Just like you I was convinced that, ""you don't take a loss until you sell"" - which is true. However, I have been shorting the market since the 7.8k mark and have made my losses back plus a healthy amount on the side. With this large amount of extra money in my trading account, I can now buy back the market once the regulators come- until then... I will be collecting and hope  you guys decide to as well.

June 26 close (using UTC timezone) shows that  MACD  (12,26,9) is experiencing a  bullish divergence ; it is a small one and so I don't have a lot of conviction at this stage.

Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC 0.11%  stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000 
!! killerFckr is RED people. Still RED. 

Stay calm, trade wisely.

As I stated in my last published idea,  Bitcoin 0.15%  is falling and falling fast. Please put your pride aside and make money will you can while the market continues to tank before the regulators come in. WE ARE IN A BEAR MARKET! Let us not keep falling for the moon reversal that  Bitcoin 0.15%  keeps fooling us with! 

Now, with that said- lets get down to the numbers

June 26 close (using UTC timezone) shows that  MACD  (12,26,9) is experiencing a  bullish divergence ; it is a small one and so I don't have a lot of conviction at this stage. Separately, I use  MACD  (19,38,13) which is optimised for the Jan14-Jan18 period; this modified  MACD  still flashes a ""SELL"" signal.

Hello followers and other TradingView (TV) users! 
Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin 0.21%  price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin 0.21%  want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH 0.25% ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin 0.21% , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin 0.21%  reversal! In this area on the  BTC 0.21%  chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also!

Hello followers and other TradingView (TV) users! 
Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin 0.03%  price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin 0.03%  want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH 0.25% ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin 0.03% , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin 0.03%  reversal! In this area on the  BTC 0.03%  chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also!

The  Bitcoin 0.03%  rate is still in flat.

Bitcoin 0.03%  rate is still in uncertainty: on one hand, it cannot stand falling and on the other buyers do not pour money into the market. In such trading conditions, it is better not to make  Bitcoin 0.03%  transactions. 
Today we are on the side of bulls; we stick to our forecast of a slight increase in the  Bitcoin 0.03%  rate to $ 6550. However, other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.03%  will rise from $ 6100 to $ 6550.

Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC              stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000

Stay calm, trade wisely.

As I stated in my last published idea,  Bitcoin 0.03%  is falling and falling fast. Please put your pride aside and make money will you can while the market continues to tank before the regulators come in. WE ARE IN A BEAR MARKET! Let us not keep falling for the moon reversal that  Bitcoin 0.03%  keeps fooling us with! 

Now, with that said- lets get down to the numbers 
Simply put,  check out the dark red channel that will serve as the red carpet arrival to  Bitcoins 0.03%  $5400 mark.  
WARNING;;; there is a heavy chance that we will see some form of resistance at these places: 
     - $6000 mark- 
     -$5900 mark-

You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also!

Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC 0.03%  stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000 
!! killerFckr is RED people. Still RED. 

Stay calm, trade wisely.  

Cryptocholics out, peace out!

As I stated in my last published idea,  Bitcoin 0.03%  is falling and falling fast. Please put your pride aside and make money will you can while the market continues to tank before the regulators come in. WE ARE IN A BEAR MARKET! Let us not keep falling for the moon reversal that  Bitcoin 0.03%  keeps fooling us with! 

Now, with that said- lets get down to the numbers 
Simply put,  check out the dark red channel that will serve as the red carpet arrival to  Bitcoins 0.03%  $5400 mark.  
WARNING;;; there is a heavy chance that we will see some form of resistance at these places: 
     - $6000 mark- 
     -$5900 mark- 
     - $5780 mark-  
All 3 of these marks (marked in orange on the chart) stand as one of the swings that formed a resistance to the price continuing its progression within this bear market.  

+++PLEASE do not fall for the bear trap at these reversal levels+++ 

In closing, (HERE IS A LITTLE BACKGROUND) ::: I want you guys to know that I am an avid believer in the bright future of cryptocurrency. I was once a proud ""HODLER"" myself until  I couldn't take checking my blockfolio every two days to see another 2k down the drain. Just like you I was convinced that, ""you don't take a loss until you sell"" - which is true. However, I have been shorting the market since the 7.8k mark and have made my losses back plus a healthy amount on the side. With this large amount of extra money in my trading account, I can now buy back the market once the regulators come- until then... I will be collecting and hope  you guys decide to as well.

June 26 close (using UTC timezone) shows that  MACD  (12,26,9) is experiencing a  bullish divergence ; it is a small one and so I don't have a lot of conviction at this stage. Separately, I use  MACD  (19,38,13) which is optimised for the Jan14-Jan18 period; this modified  MACD  still flashes a ""SELL"" signal.

Hello followers and other TradingView (TV) users! 
Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin              price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin              want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH             ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin             , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin              reversal! In this area on the  BTC              chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

As I stated in my last published idea,  Bitcoin              is falling and falling fast. Please put your pride aside and make money will you can while the market continues to tank before the regulators come in. WE ARE IN A BEAR MARKET! Let us not keep falling for the moon reversal that  Bitcoin              keeps fooling us with!

Hello followers and other TradingView (TV) users! 
Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin 0.04%  price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin 0.04%  want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH 0.25% ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin 0.04% , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin 0.04%  reversal! In this area on the  BTC 0.04%  chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also!

The  Bitcoin 0.04%  rate is still in flat.

Bitcoin 0.04%  rate is still in uncertainty: on one hand, it cannot stand falling and on the other buyers do not pour money into the market. In such trading conditions, it is better not to make  Bitcoin 0.04%  transactions. 
Today we are on the side of bulls; we stick to our forecast of a slight increase in the  Bitcoin 0.04%  rate to $ 6550. However, other scenarios are possible.

Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC 0.05%  stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000

Stay calm, trade wisely.

Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin 0.04%  price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin 0.04%  want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH 0.25% ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin 0.04% , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin 0.04%  reversal! In this area on the  BTC 0.04%  chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also!

The  Bitcoin 0.03%  rate is still in flat. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  BTCUSD 0.03% . 
Bitcoin 0.03%  rate is still in uncertainty: on one hand, it cannot stand falling and on the other buyers do not pour money into the market. In such trading conditions, it is better not to make  Bitcoin 0.03%  transactions. 
Today we are on the side of bulls; we stick to our forecast of a slight increase in the  Bitcoin 0.03%  rate to $ 6550. However, other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.03%  will rise from $ 6100 to $ 6550.

Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC 0.03%  stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000 
!! killerFckr is RED people. Still RED. 

Stay calm, trade wisely.  

Cryptocholics out, peace out!

The price is back again near the 6,000 level after being rejected yesterday on two strong  bearish  1H candles ( Engulfing , Three Outside Down on Highs/Lows = -33.0071, B/BP = -85.7219). 4H remains within a  Triangle pattern  ( STOCH  = 45.730, Williams = -46.245) which breaks id 5,928.28 is crossed. 1D remains a standard Channel Down ( RSI  = 33.875,  MACD  = -370.000) which steadily looks for a Lower Low (Highs/Lows = -182.5658). TP = 5,617.4 (1W MA100) intact. See how a new Channel Down has emerged, which primarily rejected any upside attempts on 6,340.50 and 6,261.10.

As I stated in my last published idea,  Bitcoin              is falling and falling fast. Please put your pride aside and make money will you can while the market continues to tank before the regulators come in. WE ARE IN A BEAR MARKET! Let us not keep falling for the moon reversal that  Bitcoin              keeps fooling us with! 

Now, with that said- lets get down to the numbers 
Simply put,  check out the dark red channel that will serve as the red carpet arrival to  Bitcoins              $5400 mark.  
WARNING;;; there is a heavy chance that we will see some form of resistance at these places: 
     - $6000 mark- 
     -$5900 mark- 
     - $5780 mark-  
All 3 of these marks (marked in orange on the chart) stand as one of the swings that formed a resistance to the price continuing its progression within this bear market.  

+++PLEASE do not fall for the bear trap at these reversal levels+++ 

In closing, (HERE IS A LITTLE BACKGROUND) ::: I want you guys to know that I am an avid believer in the bright future of cryptocurrency. I was once a proud ""HODLER"" myself until  I couldn't take checking my blockfolio every two days to see another 2k down the drain. Just like you I was convinced that, ""you don't take a loss until you sell"" - which is true. However, I have been shorting the market since the 7.8k mark and have made my losses back plus a healthy amount on the side. With this large amount of extra money in my trading account, I can now buy back the market once the regulators come- until then... I will be collecting and hope  you guys decide to as well.

June 26 close (using UTC timezone) shows that  MACD  (12,26,9) is experiencing a  bullish divergence ; it is a small one and so I don't have a lot of conviction at this stage. Separately, I use  MACD  (19,38,13) which is optimised for the Jan14-Jan18 period; this modified  MACD  still flashes a ""SELL"" signal.

Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC 0.03%  stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000 
!! killerFckr is RED people. Still RED. 

Stay calm, trade wisely.  

Cryptocholics out, peace out!

Hello followers and other TradingView (TV) users! 
Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin 0.03%  price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin 0.03%  want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH 0.25% ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin 0.03% , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin 0.03%  reversal! In this area on the  BTC 0.03%  chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also!

The  Bitcoin 0.03%  rate is still in flat.

Bitcoin 0.03%  rate is still in uncertainty: on one hand, it cannot stand falling and on the other buyers do not pour money into the market. In such trading conditions, it is better not to make  Bitcoin 0.03%  transactions. 
Today we are on the side of bulls; we stick to our forecast of a slight increase in the  Bitcoin 0.03%  rate to $ 6550. However, other scenarios are possible.

Hello followers and other TradingView (TV) users! 
Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin 0.03%  price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin 0.03%  want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH 0.25% ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin 0.03% , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin 0.03%  reversal! In this area on the  BTC 0.03%  chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also!

The  Bitcoin 0.03%  rate is still in flat. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  BTCUSD 0.03% . 
Bitcoin 0.03%  rate is still in uncertainty: on one hand, it cannot stand falling and on the other buyers do not pour money into the market. In such trading conditions, it is better not to make  Bitcoin 0.03%  transactions. 
Today we are on the side of bulls; we stick to our forecast of a slight increase in the  Bitcoin 0.03%  rate to $ 6550. However, other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.03%  will rise from $ 6100 to $ 6550. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.03%  will decrease from $ 6100 to $ 5500.

Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC 0.03%  stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000 
!! killerFckr is RED people. Still RED. 

Stay calm, trade wisely.  

Cryptocholics out, peace out!

TP = 5,617.4 (1W MA100) intact. See how a new Channel Down has emerged, which primarily rejected any upside attempts on 6,340.50 and 6,261.10.

As I stated in my last published idea,  Bitcoin 0.03%  is falling and falling fast. Please put your pride aside and make money will you can while the market continues to tank before the regulators come in. WE ARE IN A BEAR MARKET! Let us not keep falling for the moon reversal that  Bitcoin 0.03%  keeps fooling us with! 

Now, with that said- lets get down to the numbers 
Simply put,  check out the dark red channel that will serve as the red carpet arrival to  Bitcoins 0.03%  $5400 mark.  
WARNING;;; there is a heavy chance that we will see some form of resistance at these places: 
     - $6000 mark- 
     -$5900 mark- 
     - $5780 mark-  
All 3 of these marks (marked in orange on the chart) stand as one of the swings that formed a resistance to the price continuing its progression within this bear market.  

+++PLEASE do not fall for the bear trap at these reversal levels+++ 

In closing, (HERE IS A LITTLE BACKGROUND) ::: I want you guys to know that I am an avid believer in the bright future of cryptocurrency. I was once a proud ""HODLER"" myself until  I couldn't take checking my blockfolio every two days to see another 2k down the drain. Just like you I was convinced that, ""you don't take a loss until you sell"" - which is true. However, I have been shorting the market since the 7.8k mark and have made my losses back plus a healthy amount on the side. With this large amount of extra money in my trading account, I can now buy back the market once the regulators come- until then... I will be collecting and hope  you guys decide to as well.

June 26 close (using UTC timezone) shows that  MACD  (12,26,9) is experiencing a  bullish divergence ; it is a small one and so I don't have a lot of conviction at this stage.

Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC 0.07%  stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000 
!! killerFckr is RED people. Still RED. 

Stay calm, trade wisely.

Please put your pride aside and make money will you can while the market continues to tank before the regulators come in. WE ARE IN A BEAR MARKET! Let us not keep falling for the moon reversal that  Bitcoin 0.08%  keeps fooling us with!

June 26 close (using UTC timezone) shows that  MACD  (12,26,9) is experiencing a  bullish divergence ; it is a small one and so I don't have a lot of conviction at this stage.

Hello followers and other TradingView (TV) users! 
Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin 0.10%  price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin 0.10%  want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH 0.25% ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin 0.10% , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin 0.10%  reversal! In this area on the  BTC 0.10%  chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also!

Hello followers and other TradingView (TV) users! 
Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin 0.09%  price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin 0.09%  want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH 0.25% ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin 0.09% , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin 0.09%  reversal! In this area on the  BTC 0.09%  chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also!

The  Bitcoin 0.09%  rate is still in flat. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  BTCUSD 0.09% . 
Bitcoin 0.09%  rate is still in uncertainty: on one hand, it cannot stand falling and on the other buyers do not pour money into the market. In such trading conditions, it is better not to make  Bitcoin 0.09%  transactions. 
Today we are on the side of bulls; we stick to our forecast of a slight increase in the  Bitcoin 0.09%  rate to $ 6550. However, other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.09%  will rise from $ 6100 to $ 6550.

Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC 0.10%  stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000 
!! killerFckr is RED people. Still RED. 

Stay calm, trade wisely.

Please put your pride aside and make money will you can while the market continues to tank before the regulators come in. WE ARE IN A BEAR MARKET! Let us not keep falling for the moon reversal that  Bitcoin 0.10%  keeps fooling us with!

You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also!

Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC 0.14%  stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000 
!! killerFckr is RED people. Still RED. 

Stay calm, trade wisely.

As I stated in my last published idea,  Bitcoin 0.14%  is falling and falling fast. Please put your pride aside and make money will you can while the market continues to tank before the regulators come in. WE ARE IN A BEAR MARKET! Let us not keep falling for the moon reversal that  Bitcoin 0.14%  keeps fooling us with! 

Now, with that said- lets get down to the numbers 
Simply put,  check out the dark red channel that will serve as the red carpet arrival to  Bitcoins 0.14%  $5400 mark.  
WARNING;;; there is a heavy chance that we will see some form of resistance at these places: 
     - $6000 mark- 
     -$5900 mark- 
     - $5780 mark-  
All 3 of these marks (marked in orange on the chart) stand as one of the swings that formed a resistance to the price continuing its progression within this bear market.  

+++PLEASE do not fall for the bear trap at these reversal levels+++ 

In closing, (HERE IS A LITTLE BACKGROUND) ::: I want you guys to know that I am an avid believer in the bright future of cryptocurrency. I was once a proud ""HODLER"" myself until  I couldn't take checking my blockfolio every two days to see another 2k down the drain. Just like you I was convinced that, ""you don't take a loss until you sell"" - which is true. However, I have been shorting the market since the 7.8k mark and have made my losses back plus a healthy amount on the side. With this large amount of extra money in my trading account, I can now buy back the market once the regulators come- until then... I will be collecting and hope  you guys decide to as well.

June 26 close (using UTC timezone) shows that  MACD  (12,26,9) is experiencing a  bullish divergence ; it is a small one and so I don't have a lot of conviction at this stage. Separately, I use  MACD  (19,38,13) which is optimised for the Jan14-Jan18 period; this modified  MACD  still flashes a ""SELL"" signal.

Hello followers and other TradingView (TV) users! 
Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin 0.14%  price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin 0.14%  want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH 0.25% ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin 0.14% , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin 0.14%  reversal! In this area on the  BTC 0.14%  chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

Hello followers and other TradingView (TV) users! 
Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin 0.21%  price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin 0.21%  want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH 0.25% ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin 0.21% , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin 0.21%  reversal! In this area on the  BTC 0.21%  chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also! 
To be continued!

Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC 0.21%  stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000 
!! killerFckr is RED people. Still RED. 

Stay calm, trade wisely.

Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin 0.50%  price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin 0.50%  want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH 0.25% ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin 0.50% , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin 0.50%  reversal! In this area on the  BTC 0.50%  chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also!

Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC 0.60%  stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000 
!! killerFckr is RED people. Still RED. 

Stay calm, trade wisely.  

Cryptocholics out, peace out!

The price is back again near the 6,000 level after being rejected yesterday on two strong  bearish  1H candles ( Engulfing , Three Outside Down on Highs/Lows = -33.0071, B/BP = -85.7219). 4H remains within a  Triangle pattern  ( STOCH  = 45.730, Williams = -46.245) which breaks id 5,928.28 is crossed. 1D remains a standard Channel Down ( RSI  = 33.875,  MACD  = -370.000) which steadily looks for a Lower Low (Highs/Lows = -182.5658). TP = 5,617.4 (1W MA100) intact. See how a new Channel Down has emerged, which primarily rejected any upside attempts on 6,340.50 and 6,261.10.

As I stated in my last published idea,  Bitcoin 0.56%  is falling and falling fast. Please put your pride aside and make money will you can while the market continues to tank before the regulators come in. WE ARE IN A BEAR MARKET! Let us not keep falling for the moon reversal that  Bitcoin 0.56%  keeps fooling us with! 

Now, with that said- lets get down to the numbers 
Simply put,  check out the dark red channel that will serve as the red carpet arrival to  Bitcoins 0.56%  $5400 mark.  
WARNING;;; there is a heavy chance that we will see some form of resistance at these places: 
     - $6000 mark- 
     -$5900 mark- 
     - $5780 mark-  
All 3 of these marks (marked in orange on the chart) stand as one of the swings that formed a resistance to the price continuing its progression within this bear market.  

+++PLEASE do not fall for the bear trap at these reversal levels+++ 

In closing, (HERE IS A LITTLE BACKGROUND) ::: I want you guys to know that I am an avid believer in the bright future of cryptocurrency. I was once a proud ""HODLER"" myself until  I couldn't take checking my blockfolio every two days to see another 2k down the drain. Just like you I was convinced that, ""you don't take a loss until you sell"" - which is true. However, I have been shorting the market since the 7.8k mark and have made my losses back plus a healthy amount on the side. With this large amount of extra money in my trading account, I can now buy back the market once the regulators come- until then... I will be collecting and hope  you guys decide to as well.

June 26 close (using UTC timezone) shows that  MACD  (12,26,9) is experiencing a  bullish divergence ; it is a small one and so I don't have a lot of conviction at this stage. Separately, I use  MACD  (19,38,13) which is optimised for the Jan14-Jan18 period; this modified  MACD  still flashes a ""SELL"" signal.

Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC 0.24%  stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000 
!! killerFckr is RED people. Still RED. 

Stay calm, trade wisely.  

Cryptocholics out, peace out!

Hello followers and other TradingView (TV) users! 
Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin 0.27%  price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin 0.27%  want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH 0.25% ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin 0.27% , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin 0.27%  reversal! In this area on the  BTC 0.27%  chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also! 
To be continued!

The  Bitcoin 0.27%  rate is still in flat. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  BTCUSD 0.27% . 
Bitcoin 0.27%  rate is still in uncertainty: on one hand, it cannot stand falling and on the other buyers do not pour money into the market. In such trading conditions, it is better not to make  Bitcoin 0.27%  transactions. 
Today we are on the side of bulls; we stick to our forecast of a slight increase in the  Bitcoin 0.27%  rate to $ 6550. However, other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.27%  will rise from $ 6100 to $ 6550. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.27%  will decrease from $ 6100 to $ 5500.

Hello followers and other TradingView (TV) users! 
Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin 0.27%  price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin 0.27%  want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH 0.25% ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin 0.27% , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin 0.27%  reversal! In this area on the  BTC 0.27%  chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also!

The  Bitcoin 0.27%  rate is still in flat. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  BTCUSD 0.27% . 
Bitcoin 0.27%  rate is still in uncertainty: on one hand, it cannot stand falling and on the other buyers do not pour money into the market. In such trading conditions, it is better not to make  Bitcoin 0.27%  transactions. 
Today we are on the side of bulls; we stick to our forecast of a slight increase in the  Bitcoin 0.27%  rate to $ 6550. However, other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.27%  will rise from $ 6100 to $ 6550. 
2. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.27%  will decrease from $ 6100 to $ 5500.

Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC 0.27%  stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000 
!! killerFckr is RED people. Still RED. 

Stay calm, trade wisely.  

Cryptocholics out, peace out!

The price is back again near the 6,000 level after being rejected yesterday on two strong  bearish  1H candles ( Engulfing , Three Outside Down on Highs/Lows = -33.0071, B/BP = -85.7219). 4H remains within a  Triangle pattern  ( STOCH  = 45.730, Williams = -46.245) which breaks id 5,928.28 is crossed. 1D remains a standard Channel Down ( RSI  = 33.875,  MACD  = -370.000) which steadily looks for a Lower Low (Highs/Lows = -182.5658). TP = 5,617.4 (1W MA100) intact. See how a new Channel Down has emerged, which primarily rejected any upside attempts on 6,340.50 and 6,261.10.

As I stated in my last published idea,  Bitcoin 0.27%  is falling and falling fast. Please put your pride aside and make money will you can while the market continues to tank before the regulators come in. WE ARE IN A BEAR MARKET! Let us not keep falling for the moon reversal that  Bitcoin 0.27%  keeps fooling us with! 

Now, with that said- lets get down to the numbers 
Simply put,  check out the dark red channel that will serve as the red carpet arrival to  Bitcoins 0.27%  $5400 mark.  
WARNING;;; there is a heavy chance that we will see some form of resistance at these places: 
     - $6000 mark- 
     -$5900 mark- 
     - $5780 mark-  
All 3 of these marks (marked in orange on the chart) stand as one of the swings that formed a resistance to the price continuing its progression within this bear market.  

+++PLEASE do not fall for the bear trap at these reversal levels+++ 

In closing, (HERE IS A LITTLE BACKGROUND) ::: I want you guys to know that I am an avid believer in the bright future of cryptocurrency. I was once a proud ""HODLER"" myself until  I couldn't take checking my blockfolio every two days to see another 2k down the drain. Just like you I was convinced that, ""you don't take a loss until you sell"" - which is true. However, I have been shorting the market since the 7.8k mark and have made my losses back plus a healthy amount on the side. With this large amount of extra money in my trading account, I can now buy back the market once the regulators come- until then... I will be collecting and hope  you guys decide to as well.

June 26 close (using UTC timezone) shows that  MACD  (12,26,9) is experiencing a  bullish divergence ; it is a small one and so I don't have a lot of conviction at this stage. Separately, I use  MACD  (19,38,13) which is optimised for the Jan14-Jan18 period; this modified  MACD  still flashes a ""SELL"" signal.

Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC 0.19%  stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000 
!! killerFckr is RED people. Still RED. 

Stay calm, trade wisely.

As I stated in my last published idea,  Bitcoin 0.19%  is falling and falling fast. Please put your pride aside and make money will you can while the market continues to tank before the regulators come in. WE ARE IN A BEAR MARKET! Let us not keep falling for the moon reversal that  Bitcoin 0.19%  keeps fooling us with! 

Now, with that said- lets get down to the numbers 
Simply put,  check out the dark red channel that will serve as the red carpet arrival to  Bitcoins 0.19%  $5400 mark.

Hello followers and other TradingView (TV) users! 
Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin 0.09%  price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin 0.09%  want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH 0.25% ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin 0.09% , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin 0.09%  reversal! In this area on the  BTC 0.09%  chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also!

Hello followers and other TradingView (TV) users! 
Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin 0.03%  price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin 0.03%  want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH 0.25% ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin 0.03% , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin 0.03%  reversal! In this area on the  BTC 0.03%  chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also!

The  Bitcoin 0.03%  rate is still in flat. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  BTCUSD 0.03% . 
Bitcoin 0.03%  rate is still in uncertainty: on one hand, it cannot stand falling and on the other buyers do not pour money into the market. In such trading conditions, it is better not to make  Bitcoin 0.03%  transactions. 
Today we are on the side of bulls; we stick to our forecast of a slight increase in the  Bitcoin 0.03%  rate to $ 6550. However, other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  BTCUSD 0.03%  will rise from $ 6100 to $ 6550.

Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC 0.08%  stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000 
!! killerFckr is RED people. Still RED. 

Stay calm, trade wisely.

As I stated in my last published idea,  Bitcoin 0.08%  is falling and falling fast. Please put your pride aside and make money will you can while the market continues to tank before the regulators come in. WE ARE IN A BEAR MARKET! Let us not keep falling for the moon reversal that  Bitcoin 0.08%  keeps fooling us with! 

Now, with that said- lets get down to the numbers 
Simply put,  check out the dark red channel that will serve as the red carpet arrival to  Bitcoins 0.08%  $5400 mark.  
WARNING;;; there is a heavy chance that we will see some form of resistance at these places: 
     - $6000 mark- 
     -$5900 mark- 
     - $5780 mark-  
All 3 of these marks (marked in orange on the chart) stand as one of the swings that formed a resistance to the price continuing its progression within this bear market.

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also!

Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC 0.11%  stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000 
!! killerFckr is RED people. Still RED. 

Stay calm, trade wisely.

As I stated in my last published idea,  Bitcoin 0.11%  is falling and falling fast. Please put your pride aside and make money will you can while the market continues to tank before the regulators come in. WE ARE IN A BEAR MARKET! Let us not keep falling for the moon reversal that  Bitcoin 0.11%  keeps fooling us with! 

Now, with that said- lets get down to the numbers 
Simply put,  check out the dark red channel that will serve as the red carpet arrival to  Bitcoins 0.11%  $5400 mark.  
WARNING;;; there is a heavy chance that we will see some form of resistance at these places: 
     - $6000 mark- 
     -$5900 mark- 
     - $5780 mark-  
All 3 of these marks (marked in orange on the chart) stand as one of the swings that formed a resistance to the price continuing its progression within this bear market.  

+++PLEASE do not fall for the bear trap at these reversal levels+++ 

In closing, (HERE IS A LITTLE BACKGROUND) ::: I want you guys to know that I am an avid believer in the bright future of cryptocurrency. I was once a proud ""HODLER"" myself until  I couldn't take checking my blockfolio every two days to see another 2k down the drain. Just like you I was convinced that, ""you don't take a loss until you sell"" - which is true. However, I have been shorting the market since the 7.8k mark and have made my losses back plus a healthy amount on the side. With this large amount of extra money in my trading account, I can now buy back the market once the regulators come- until then... I will be collecting and hope  you guys decide to as well.

June 26 close (using UTC timezone) shows that  MACD  (12,26,9) is experiencing a  bullish divergence ; it is a small one and so I don't have a lot of conviction at this stage.

Hello followers and other TradingView (TV) users! 
Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin              price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin              want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH             ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin             , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin              reversal! In this area on the  BTC              chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

As I stated in my last published idea,  Bitcoin -0.04%  is falling and falling fast. Please put your pride aside and make money will you can while the market continues to tank before the regulators come in. WE ARE IN A BEAR MARKET! Let us not keep falling for the moon reversal that  Bitcoin -0.04%  keeps fooling us with! 

Now, with that said- lets get down to the numbers

All 3 of these marks (marked in orange on the chart) stand as one of the swings that formed a resistance to the price continuing its progression within this bear market.

Hello followers and other TradingView (TV) users! 
Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin -0.04%  price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin -0.04%  want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH 0.25% ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin -0.04% , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin -0.04%  reversal! In this area on the  BTC -0.04%  chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also!

Bitcoin -0.05%  rate is still in uncertainty: on one hand, it cannot stand falling and on the other buyers do not pour money into the market. In such trading conditions, it is better not to make  Bitcoin -0.05%  transactions.

Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC -0.06%  stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000 
!! killerFckr is RED people. Still RED. 

Stay calm, trade wisely.

Looks like all TV TOP authors make a  bullish  and $20k+ forecast for BTC! I have to admit that I definitely don't see  Bitcoin -0.02%  price $20k in this year! But, but we could see some bull run when we have taken out some lower levels! 
If  Bitcoin -0.02%  want's to go to the all-time high ( ATH 0.25% ) then it must gain again the people trust but at the moment like in real life - make one mistake and if You want to win again other people's trust then you have to do things right in the next 8-12 times and then maybe people trust You again! So as  Bitcoin -0.02% , this year we have only seen a disappointment after disappointment! I would like to say that the first ohooo...moment to the retail traders/investors would be the 4 digit number ($10000) when people start to come again and look what is going on here :) 

Let's jump into the chart! 
In the main 'picture' I have drawn an Elliot Wave  forecast! This matches exactly with my support levels step-by-step! First two waves have completed and we are on the 3. the longest wave. This wave must find support from ~$5400 area, there crossing the minor  trendline  and the  support area .  
In history we have three bounces from that price level (on the image below): 
*18.10.2017 
*25.10.2017 
*12.11.2017 






After that comes 4. wave (correction wave) and have to find resistance from THE BIG  Trendline  since 17.12.2017 
And now the last 5th wave, where we see  Bitcoin -0.02%  reversal! In this area on the  BTC -0.02%  chart is a 'clean' area (image below) where the price has rallied up and never looked back (12.10.2018), now we look back and finally retest this area! This area, to me, looks like a logical level where we could see the trend reversal and escape from the  bullish falling wedge  which also means break the main down  trendline  to turn  bullish  again! 






You probably think - wtf clean area, there is so many like this! But I say there is not so many as big as this one. The next is around $3k but I CAN'T be so  bearish  because I love crypto! :D

					RED CANDLE WAR! Just an interesting fact, at the moment we have 9(!!) red candle close succession in the 4h chart! 
I watched the history and from the beginning of 2016, we have seen this only two times and all those are been in this year: 
16.01.2018 - 10 red 4h candles 
04.02.2018 - 9 red 4h candles 
All those had a massive volume and big candles downwards but at the moment looks like no volume at all!

					So, as You will assume we move downwards and we move downwards inside a widened channel! We had one breakout several hours ago but not so significant and at the moment the price is back in the channel! As I mentioned yesterday we have a strong area around $6213 where we moved up and down, touched and bounced etc. but as I expected there is so much selling pressure and we bounced down! Daily candle close was bearish and from that, I could say BTC shows us bearish action today also!

Hello CryptoCholics followers, 

BTC is facing a downtrend for the last couple of months. Now what we are looking for is on the chart.  

!! Focus on the blue region. If  BTC -0.01%  stays inside it and break it we can see some bull attacks finally. 
!! Give importance to the support lines, if blue region fails. These will be your strongholds: @5780, @5370, @5000 
!! killerFckr is RED people. Still RED. 

Stay calm, trade wisely.  

Cryptocholics out, peace out!

The price is back again near the 6,000 level after being rejected yesterday on two strong  bearish  1H candles ( Engulfing , Three Outside Down on Highs/Lows = -33.0071, B/BP = -85.7219). 4H remains within a  Triangle pattern  ( STOCH  = 45.730, Williams = -46.245) which breaks id 5,928.28 is crossed. 1D remains a standard Channel Down ( RSI  = 33.875,  MACD  = -370.000) which steadily looks for a Lower Low (Highs/Lows = -182.5658). TP = 5,617.4 (1W MA100) intact. See how a new Channel Down has emerged, which primarily rejected any upside attempts on 6,340.50 and 6,261.10.

As I stated in my last published idea,  Bitcoin -0.01%  is falling and falling fast. Please put your pride aside and make money will you can while the market continues to tank before the regulators come in. WE ARE IN A BEAR MARKET! Let us not keep falling for the moon reversal that  Bitcoin -0.01%  keeps fooling us with! 

Now, with that said- lets get down to the numbers 
Simply put,  check out the dark red channel that will serve as the red carpet arrival to  Bitcoins -0.01%  $5400 mark.  
WARNING;;; there is a heavy chance that we will see some form of resistance at these places: 
     - $6000 mark- 
     -$5900 mark- 
     - $5780 mark-  
All 3 of these marks (marked in orange on the chart) stand as one of the swings that formed a resistance to the price continuing its progression within this bear market.  

+++PLEASE do not fall for the bear trap at these reversal levels+++ 

In closing, (HERE IS A LITTLE BACKGROUND) ::: I want you guys to know that I am an avid believer in the bright future of cryptocurrency. I was once a proud ""HODLER"" myself until  I couldn't take checking my blockfolio every two days to see another 2k down the drain. Just like you I was convinced that, ""you don't take a loss until you sell"" - which is true. However, I have been shorting the market since the 7.8k mark and have made my losses back plus a healthy amount on the side. With this large amount of extra money in my trading account, I can now buy back the market once the regulators come- until then... I will be collecting and hope  you guys decide to as well.

June 26 close (using UTC timezone) shows that  MACD  (12,26,9) is experiencing a  bullish divergence ; it is a small one and so I don't have a lot of conviction at this stage. Separately, I use  MACD  (19,38,13) which is optimised for the Jan14-Jan18 period; this modified  MACD  still flashes a ""SELL"" signal.
