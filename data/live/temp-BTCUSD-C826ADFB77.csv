1530684502.0,InvestingScope,Lower High Rejection on the 1D Channel Down. Short.,"
Since the ""unfilled pattern"" (ellipse shape on the chart) the price changed its sequence and rose higher than the 6,446.20 1H Resistance. Still as you see it made a Lower High Rejection on the 1D Channel Down. 1H has already made a near 6,400 test ( RSI  = 38.785, Highs/Lows = -23.0500, B/BP = -69.0539) with  MACD  = -21.200 indicating that the SMA200 = 6,266.1 is its next and final target. As a result, that 4H Channel Up (caused by the ""unfilled pattern"") is now void ( ADX  = 22.847, B/BP  = -71.3297) and since the June 18 - 20 6,850 Highs were not reclaimed, 1D should look to fill the downside gap to 6,000 (essentially all its remaining MA period) again on a  MACD  = -199.900. Still sell mode with TP = 5,617.4 as 1W remains  bearish  overall (Highs/Lows = -77.2664, B/BP = -8412.8402,  MACD  = -448.700). According to the 1W curve since the 19,891.0  ATH -1.03% , the uptrend is limited to 7,712.60. We have already added the second short at 6,640 and will look for a final at 7,700 (if presented), but this scenario is highly unlikely.

Price changes like in kaleidoscope - You can turn and twist  BTC -0.54%  chart and will find different formations and patterns and thatâ€™s why for now You are better off sticking to  support and resistance . 
As expected price fall from  rising wedge  but not much as stopped on 6400 support. Rejection candle suggest that there is a chance to go back to 6650 but we would love to see some more confirmation for that.  
Small price rise which we are experiencing now can be only temporary and most likely last up to 6550 level. 
If  BTC -0.54%  breaks 6400 support next stop is 100$ lower at 6300. 
Some traders are looking for  Head and Shoulders  pattern at 6150 level but to see that formation we need price to drop to 6150 first and that means 300$ lower which is around 4.5% drop.

 Bitcoin -0.54%  started a downside correction as the currency pair loses around two percent in the past 24 hours. However, we think that this correction is nothing more than just a pause of the uptrend as crypto market is still  bullish . Investors fixed their positions but they are likely to resume buying in the nearest future. 

BTC/USD had a  bullish Flag  pattern on Tuesday, but failed to develop its upside progress as the price reached the  support area  at $6,510 and tested it.  Bitcoin -0.54%  jumped over this level, but still has opportunities to return above the resistance (which was the support previously). We can see a clear  Hammer candlestick  pattern on the Hourly chart meaning the currency pair is ready to grow in the nearest future. 
The closest targets for  Bitcoin -0.54%  growth lie at the  resistance area  at $6,718. BTC/USD is likely to start growing towards this level on Wednesday. This is the main scenario for the next 24 hours. However, if bulls fail to drive the currency pair higher, we will become witnesses of a deeper downside correction aiming at the next  support area  at $6,329.

		This is a deliberately simple chart. This distorted and skewed symmetry from recent months seems to be coming to an end soon. It is by no means a reliable precedent but the last time symmetry from the March high ended we set our medium-term bottom down in the mid-6's and travelled to knock on the 10K ceiling- some swingers more than doubled their money just by holding ETH or BCH for a month. This is an interesting and bizarre pattern to look at because finding the middle of it (ironically, the middle was around 6/6) seems to dictate where something will eventually shift and change by tracing the patterns to its end. Is it completely meaningless? I don't know. I tend to think that the February bottom was too quick / merely a test, the April bottom was barely enough accumulation and if this does end up being a bottom soon it may give us sideways action lasting longer than we expected... which could also lead to failure and capitulation instead of another prolonged rally. I'm sharing this only because I see it.. not because it gives me direction. No advice here! Just some fun ideas as everyone is now wanting to turn  bullish . I do believe we deserve more accumulation in the 4-7K range before any sort of legitimate bull run can occur but don't assume we're going to get it. I am very open to to seeing this becoming a bottom. Is there anything better than a swinger showing you his or her bottom? ;)

Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin -0.54%  pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc -0.54%  always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever! 

Keep it Real!

Yesterday i told you guys to watch for those ""TO THE MOON BUY NOW- Technical Analysis""  since many popped lately. 
I hope that i have helped some people stay cool since we dropped 250points since than, its really important to stay cool at all times no matter if you making or loosing money because you will make bad decisions at those times, if you have problem with this set trading rules for yourself and buy some books on Psychology in Trading and it will help you become better trader. 
I treat Trading like a sport, feel like a athlete competing with others. If you want to be great at something you need to put more effort than anyone else, I constantly read new books on trading strategies, many of them are outdated written during DOTcom bubble but you can still learn a lot from them. 

Im here to help, brings me happiness to see those msgs about YOU guys learning, succeeding and becoming better traders. Keep them coming !! THANKS !! 

Good Luck All !! Happy 4th !!

		This is a deliberately simple chart. This distorted and skewed symmetry from recent months seems to be coming to an end soon. It is by no means a reliable precedent but the last time symmetry from the March high ended we set our medium-term bottom down in the mid-6's and travelled to knock on the 10K ceiling- some swingers more than doubled their money just by holding ETH or BCH for a month. This is an interesting and bizarre pattern to look at because finding the middle of it (ironically, the middle was around 6/6) seems to dictate where something will eventually shift and change by tracing the patterns to its end. Is it completely meaningless? I don't know. I tend to think that the February bottom was too quick / merely a test, the April bottom was barely enough accumulation and if this does end up being a bottom soon it may give us sideways action lasting longer than we expected... which could also lead to failure and capitulation instead of another prolonged rally. I'm sharing this only because I see it.. not because it gives me direction. No advice here! Just some fun ideas as everyone is now wanting to turn  bullish . I do believe we deserve more accumulation in the 4-7K range before any sort of legitimate bull run can occur but don't assume we're going to get it. I am very open to to seeing this becoming a bottom. Is there anything better than a swinger showing you his or her bottom? ;)

Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever!

I hope that i have helped some people stay cool since we dropped 250points since than, its really important to stay cool at all times no matter if you making or loosing money because you will make bad decisions at those times, if you have problem with this set trading rules for yourself and buy some books on Psychology in Trading and it will help you become better trader. 
I treat Trading like a sport, feel like a athlete competing with others. If you want to be great at something you need to put more effort than anyone else, I constantly read new books on trading strategies, many of them are outdated written during DOTcom bubble but you can still learn a lot from them.

1530684502.0,InvestingScope,Lower High Rejection on the 1D Channel Down. Short.,"
Since the ""unfilled pattern"" (ellipse shape on the chart) the price changed its sequence and rose higher than the 6,446.20 1H Resistance. Still as you see it made a Lower High Rejection on the 1D Channel Down. 1H has already made a near 6,400 test ( RSI  = 38.785, Highs/Lows = -23.0500, B/BP = -69.0539) with  MACD  = -21.200 indicating that the SMA200 = 6,266.1 is its next and final target. As a result, that 4H Channel Up (caused by the ""unfilled pattern"") is now void ( ADX  = 22.847, B/BP  = -71.3297) and since the June 18 - 20 6,850 Highs were not reclaimed, 1D should look to fill the downside gap to 6,000 (essentially all its remaining MA period) again on a  MACD  = -199.900. Still sell mode with TP = 5,617.4 as 1W remains  bearish  overall (Highs/Lows = -77.2664, B/BP = -8412.8402,  MACD  = -448.700). According to the 1W curve since the 19,891.0  ATH -1.03% , the uptrend is limited to 7,712.60. We have already added the second short at 6,640 and will look for a final at 7,700 (if presented), but this scenario is highly unlikely.

Price changes like in kaleidoscope - You can turn and twist  BTC Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   chart and will find different formations and patterns and thatâ€™s why for now You are better off sticking to  support and resistance . 
As expected price fall from  rising wedge  but not much as stopped on 6400 support. Rejection candle suggest that there is a chance to go back to 6650 but we would love to see some more confirmation for that.  
Small price rise which we are experiencing now can be only temporary and most likely last up to 6550 level. 
If  BTC Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   breaks 6400 support next stop is 100$ lower at 6300. 
Some traders are looking for  Head and Shoulders  pattern at 6150 level but to see that formation we need price to drop to 6150 first and that means 300$ lower which is around 4.5% drop.

1530682799.0,paulflint,Where are we now,"
Just trying to work out where we are 
If this is just stretching a leg of the pattern out for a bit of up then the pattern remains 
If it was reversal then the pattern may change 
If it is caused by a big players withdrawal from the market then the pattern is caused by the algorithm and could change once that big player has left 
Could also be a load of nonsense, some say people who look hard enough can find a pattern even where a pattern does not exist

1530680690.0,CryptoComes,BTC/USD Starts Downside Correction,"
 Bitcoin Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   started a downside correction as the currency pair loses around two percent in the past 24 hours. However, we think that this correction is nothing more than just a pause of the uptrend as crypto market is still  bullish . Investors fixed their positions but they are likely to resume buying in the nearest future. 

BTC/USD had a  bullish Flag  pattern on Tuesday, but failed to develop its upside progress as the price reached the  support area  at $6,510 and tested it.  Bitcoin Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   jumped over this level, but still has opportunities to return above the resistance (which was the support previously). We can see a clear  Hammer candlestick  pattern on the Hourly chart meaning the currency pair is ready to grow in the nearest future. 
The closest targets for  Bitcoin Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   growth lie at the  resistance area  at $6,718. BTC/USD is likely to start growing towards this level on Wednesday. This is the main scenario for the next 24 hours. However, if bulls fail to drive the currency pair higher, we will become witnesses of a deeper downside correction aiming at the next  support area  at $6,329.

Still as you see it made a Lower High Rejection on the 1D Channel Down. 1H has already made a near 6,400 test ( RSI  = 38.785, Highs/Lows = -23.0500, B/BP = -69.0539) with  MACD  = -21.200 indicating that the SMA200 = 6,266.1 is its next and final target. As a result, that 4H Channel Up (caused by the ""unfilled pattern"") is now void ( ADX  = 22.847, B/BP  = -71.3297) and since the June 18 - 20 6,850 Highs were not reclaimed, 1D should look to fill the downside gap to 6,000 (essentially all its remaining MA period) again on a  MACD  = -199.900. Still sell mode with TP = 5,617.4 as 1W remains  bearish  overall (Highs/Lows = -77.2664, B/BP = -8412.8402,  MACD  = -448.700). According to the 1W curve since the 19,891.0  ATH -1.03% , the uptrend is limited to 7,712.60.

		This is a deliberately simple chart. This distorted and skewed symmetry from recent months seems to be coming to an end soon. It is by no means a reliable precedent but the last time symmetry from the March high ended we set our medium-term bottom down in the mid-6's and travelled to knock on the 10K ceiling- some swingers more than doubled their money just by holding ETH or BCH for a month. This is an interesting and bizarre pattern to look at because finding the middle of it (ironically, the middle was around 6/6) seems to dictate where something will eventually shift and change by tracing the patterns to its end. Is it completely meaningless? I don't know. I tend to think that the February bottom was too quick / merely a test, the April bottom was barely enough accumulation and if this does end up being a bottom soon it may give us sideways action lasting longer than we expected... which could also lead to failure and capitulation instead of another prolonged rally. I'm sharing this only because I see it.. not because it gives me direction. No advice here! Just some fun ideas as everyone is now wanting to turn  bullish . I do believe we deserve more accumulation in the 4-7K range before any sort of legitimate bull run can occur but don't assume we're going to get it. I am very open to to seeing this becoming a bottom. Is there anything better than a swinger showing you his or her bottom? ;)

1530679059.0,Keep-it-Real,BITCOIN NEVER HAVE SEEN THESE MUCH RESISTANCE!,"
Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin -0.60%  pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc -0.60%  always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever! 

Keep it Real!

Hello ! 
Everything Explained in Video !! 



Yesterday i told you guys to watch for those ""TO THE MOON BUY NOW- Technical Analysis""  since many popped lately. 
I hope that i have helped some people stay cool since we dropped 250points since than, its really important to stay cool at all times no matter if you making or loosing money because you will make bad decisions at those times, if you have problem with this set trading rules for yourself and buy some books on Psychology in Trading and it will help you become better trader. 
I treat Trading like a sport, feel like a athlete competing with others. If you want to be great at something you need to put more effort than anyone else, I constantly read new books on trading strategies, many of them are outdated written during DOTcom bubble but you can still learn a lot from them. 

Im here to help, brings me happiness to see those msgs about YOU guys learning, succeeding and becoming better traders. Keep them coming !! THANKS !! 

Good Luck All !! Happy 4th !!

It is by no means a reliable precedent but the last time symmetry from the March high ended we set our medium-term bottom down in the mid-6's and travelled to knock on the 10K ceiling- some swingers more than doubled their money just by holding ETH or BCH for a month. This is an interesting and bizarre pattern to look at because finding the middle of it (ironically, the middle was around 6/6) seems to dictate where something will eventually shift and change by tracing the patterns to its end. Is it completely meaningless? I don't know. I tend to think that the February bottom was too quick / merely a test, the April bottom was barely enough accumulation and if this does end up being a bottom soon it may give us sideways action lasting longer than we expected... which could also lead to failure and capitulation instead of another prolonged rally. I'm sharing this only because I see it.. not because it gives me direction. No advice here! Just some fun ideas as everyone is now wanting to turn  bullish . I do believe we deserve more accumulation in the 4-7K range before any sort of legitimate bull run can occur but don't assume we're going to get it. I am very open to to seeing this becoming a bottom. Is there anything better than a swinger showing you his or her bottom? ;)

Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin -0.60%  pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc -0.60%  always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever!

I hope that i have helped some people stay cool since we dropped 250points since than, its really important to stay cool at all times no matter if you making or loosing money because you will make bad decisions at those times, if you have problem with this set trading rules for yourself and buy some books on Psychology in Trading and it will help you become better trader. 
I treat Trading like a sport, feel like a athlete competing with others. If you want to be great at something you need to put more effort than anyone else, I constantly read new books on trading strategies, many of them are outdated written during DOTcom bubble but you can still learn a lot from them.

Since the ""unfilled pattern"" (ellipse shape on the chart) the price changed its sequence and rose higher than the 6,446.20 1H Resistance. Still as you see it made a Lower High Rejection on the 1D Channel Down. 1H has already made a near 6,400 test ( RSI  = 38.785, Highs/Lows = -23.0500, B/BP = -69.0539) with  MACD  = -21.200 indicating that the SMA200 = 6,266.1 is its next and final target. As a result, that 4H Channel Up (caused by the ""unfilled pattern"") is now void ( ADX  = 22.847, B/BP  = -71.3297) and since the June 18 - 20 6,850 Highs were not reclaimed, 1D should look to fill the downside gap to 6,000 (essentially all its remaining MA period) again on a  MACD  = -199.900. Still sell mode with TP = 5,617.4 as 1W remains  bearish  overall (Highs/Lows = -77.2664, B/BP = -8412.8402,  MACD  = -448.700). According to the 1W curve since the 19,891.0  ATH -1.03% , the uptrend is limited to 7,712.60. We have already added the second short at 6,640 and will look for a final at 7,700 (if presented), but this scenario is highly unlikely.

Price changes like in kaleidoscope - You can turn and twist  BTC -0.60%  chart and will find different formations and patterns and thatâ€™s why for now You are better off sticking to  support and resistance . 
As expected price fall from  rising wedge  but not much as stopped on 6400 support. Rejection candle suggest that there is a chance to go back to 6650 but we would love to see some more confirmation for that.  
Small price rise which we are experiencing now can be only temporary and most likely last up to 6550 level. 
If  BTC -0.60%  breaks 6400 support next stop is 100$ lower at 6300. 
Some traders are looking for  Head and Shoulders  pattern at 6150 level but to see that formation we need price to drop to 6150 first and that means 300$ lower which is around 4.5% drop.

Just trying to work out where we are 
If this is just stretching a leg of the pattern out for a bit of up then the pattern remains 
If it was reversal then the pattern may change 
If it is caused by a big players withdrawal from the market then the pattern is caused by the algorithm and could change once that big player has left 
Could also be a load of nonsense, some say people who look hard enough can find a pattern even where a pattern does not exist

1530680690.0,CryptoComes,BTC/USD Starts Downside Correction,"
 Bitcoin -0.60%  started a downside correction as the currency pair loses around two percent in the past 24 hours. However, we think that this correction is nothing more than just a pause of the uptrend as crypto market is still  bullish . Investors fixed their positions but they are likely to resume buying in the nearest future. 

BTC/USD had a  bullish Flag  pattern on Tuesday, but failed to develop its upside progress as the price reached the  support area  at $6,510 and tested it.  Bitcoin -0.60%  jumped over this level, but still has opportunities to return above the resistance (which was the support previously). We can see a clear  Hammer candlestick  pattern on the Hourly chart meaning the currency pair is ready to grow in the nearest future. 
The closest targets for  Bitcoin -0.60%  growth lie at the  resistance area  at $6,718. BTC/USD is likely to start growing towards this level on Wednesday. This is the main scenario for the next 24 hours. However, if bulls fail to drive the currency pair higher, we will become witnesses of a deeper downside correction aiming at the next  support area  at $6,329.

According to the 1W curve since the 19,891.0  ATH Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  , the uptrend is limited to 7,712.60. We have already added the second short at 6,640 and will look for a final at 7,700 (if presented), but this scenario is highly unlikely.

		This is a deliberately simple chart. This distorted and skewed symmetry from recent months seems to be coming to an end soon. It is by no means a reliable precedent but the last time symmetry from the March high ended we set our medium-term bottom down in the mid-6's and travelled to knock on the 10K ceiling- some swingers more than doubled their money just by holding ETH or BCH for a month. This is an interesting and bizarre pattern to look at because finding the middle of it (ironically, the middle was around 6/6) seems to dictate where something will eventually shift and change by tracing the patterns to its end. Is it completely meaningless? I don't know. I tend to think that the February bottom was too quick / merely a test, the April bottom was barely enough accumulation and if this does end up being a bottom soon it may give us sideways action lasting longer than we expected... which could also lead to failure and capitulation instead of another prolonged rally. I'm sharing this only because I see it.. not because it gives me direction. No advice here! Just some fun ideas as everyone is now wanting to turn  bullish . I do believe we deserve more accumulation in the 4-7K range before any sort of legitimate bull run can occur but don't assume we're going to get it. I am very open to to seeing this becoming a bottom. Is there anything better than a swinger showing you his or her bottom? ;)

1530679059.0,Keep-it-Real,BITCOIN NEVER HAVE SEEN THESE MUCH RESISTANCE!,"
Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever! 

Keep it Real!

Hello ! 
Everything Explained in Video !! 



Yesterday i told you guys to watch for those ""TO THE MOON BUY NOW- Technical Analysis""  since many popped lately. 
I hope that i have helped some people stay cool since we dropped 250points since than, its really important to stay cool at all times no matter if you making or loosing money because you will make bad decisions at those times, if you have problem with this set trading rules for yourself and buy some books on Psychology in Trading and it will help you become better trader. 
I treat Trading like a sport, feel like a athlete competing with others. If you want to be great at something you need to put more effort than anyone else, I constantly read new books on trading strategies, many of them are outdated written during DOTcom bubble but you can still learn a lot from them. 

Im here to help, brings me happiness to see those msgs about YOU guys learning, succeeding and becoming better traders. Keep them coming !! THANKS !! 

Good Luck All !! Happy 4th !!

It is by no means a reliable precedent but the last time symmetry from the March high ended we set our medium-term bottom down in the mid-6's and travelled to knock on the 10K ceiling- some swingers more than doubled their money just by holding ETH or BCH for a month. This is an interesting and bizarre pattern to look at because finding the middle of it (ironically, the middle was around 6/6) seems to dictate where something will eventually shift and change by tracing the patterns to its end. Is it completely meaningless? I don't know. I tend to think that the February bottom was too quick / merely a test, the April bottom was barely enough accumulation and if this does end up being a bottom soon it may give us sideways action lasting longer than we expected... which could also lead to failure and capitulation instead of another prolonged rally. I'm sharing this only because I see it.. not because it gives me direction. No advice here! Just some fun ideas as everyone is now wanting to turn  bullish . I do believe we deserve more accumulation in the 4-7K range before any sort of legitimate bull run can occur but don't assume we're going to get it. I am very open to to seeing this becoming a bottom. Is there anything better than a swinger showing you his or her bottom? ;)

Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever!

Since the ""unfilled pattern"" (ellipse shape on the chart) the price changed its sequence and rose higher than the 6,446.20 1H Resistance. Still as you see it made a Lower High Rejection on the 1D Channel Down. 1H has already made a near 6,400 test ( RSI  = 38.785, Highs/Lows = -23.0500, B/BP = -69.0539) with  MACD  = -21.200 indicating that the SMA200 = 6,266.1 is its next and final target. As a result, that 4H Channel Up (caused by the ""unfilled pattern"") is now void ( ADX  = 22.847, B/BP  = -71.3297) and since the June 18 - 20 6,850 Highs were not reclaimed, 1D should look to fill the downside gap to 6,000 (essentially all its remaining MA period) again on a  MACD  = -199.900. Still sell mode with TP = 5,617.4 as 1W remains  bearish  overall (Highs/Lows = -77.2664, B/BP = -8412.8402,  MACD  = -448.700). According to the 1W curve since the 19,891.0  ATH -1.03% , the uptrend is limited to 7,712.60. We have already added the second short at 6,640 and will look for a final at 7,700 (if presented), but this scenario is highly unlikely.

Price changes like in kaleidoscope - You can turn and twist  BTC -0.46%  chart and will find different formations and patterns and thatâ€™s why for now You are better off sticking to  support and resistance . 
As expected price fall from  rising wedge  but not much as stopped on 6400 support. Rejection candle suggest that there is a chance to go back to 6650 but we would love to see some more confirmation for that.  
Small price rise which we are experiencing now can be only temporary and most likely last up to 6550 level. 
If  BTC -0.46%  breaks 6400 support next stop is 100$ lower at 6300. 
Some traders are looking for  Head and Shoulders  pattern at 6150 level but to see that formation we need price to drop to 6150 first and that means 300$ lower which is around 4.5% drop.

Just trying to work out where we are 
If this is just stretching a leg of the pattern out for a bit of up then the pattern remains 
If it was reversal then the pattern may change 
If it is caused by a big players withdrawal from the market then the pattern is caused by the algorithm and could change once that big player has left 
Could also be a load of nonsense, some say people who look hard enough can find a pattern even where a pattern does not exist

1530680690.0,CryptoComes,BTC/USD Starts Downside Correction,"
 Bitcoin -0.46%  started a downside correction as the currency pair loses around two percent in the past 24 hours. However, we think that this correction is nothing more than just a pause of the uptrend as crypto market is still  bullish . Investors fixed their positions but they are likely to resume buying in the nearest future. 

BTC/USD had a  bullish Flag  pattern on Tuesday, but failed to develop its upside progress as the price reached the  support area  at $6,510 and tested it.  Bitcoin -0.46%  jumped over this level, but still has opportunities to return above the resistance (which was the support previously). We can see a clear  Hammer candlestick  pattern on the Hourly chart meaning the currency pair is ready to grow in the nearest future. 
The closest targets for  Bitcoin -0.46%  growth lie at the  resistance area  at $6,718. BTC/USD is likely to start growing towards this level on Wednesday. This is the main scenario for the next 24 hours. However, if bulls fail to drive the currency pair higher, we will become witnesses of a deeper downside correction aiming at the next  support area  at $6,329.

Still as you see it made a Lower High Rejection on the 1D Channel Down. 1H has already made a near 6,400 test ( RSI  = 38.785, Highs/Lows = -23.0500, B/BP = -69.0539) with  MACD  = -21.200 indicating that the SMA200 = 6,266.1 is its next and final target. As a result, that 4H Channel Up (caused by the ""unfilled pattern"") is now void ( ADX  = 22.847, B/BP  = -71.3297) and since the June 18 - 20 6,850 Highs were not reclaimed, 1D should look to fill the downside gap to 6,000 (essentially all its remaining MA period) again on a  MACD  = -199.900. Still sell mode with TP = 5,617.4 as 1W remains  bearish  overall (Highs/Lows = -77.2664, B/BP = -8412.8402,  MACD  = -448.700). According to the 1W curve since the 19,891.0  ATH -1.03% , the uptrend is limited to 7,712.60. We have already added the second short at 6,640 and will look for a final at 7,700 (if presented), but this scenario is highly unlikely.

 Bitcoin -0.46%  started a downside correction as the currency pair loses around two percent in the past 24 hours. However, we think that this correction is nothing more than just a pause of the uptrend as crypto market is still  bullish . Investors fixed their positions but they are likely to resume buying in the nearest future. 

BTC/USD had a  bullish Flag  pattern on Tuesday, but failed to develop its upside progress as the price reached the  support area  at $6,510 and tested it.  Bitcoin -0.46%  jumped over this level, but still has opportunities to return above the resistance (which was the support previously). We can see a clear  Hammer candlestick  pattern on the Hourly chart meaning the currency pair is ready to grow in the nearest future. 
The closest targets for  Bitcoin -0.46%  growth lie at the  resistance area  at $6,718. BTC/USD is likely to start growing towards this level on Wednesday. This is the main scenario for the next 24 hours.

		This is a deliberately simple chart. This distorted and skewed symmetry from recent months seems to be coming to an end soon. It is by no means a reliable precedent but the last time symmetry from the March high ended we set our medium-term bottom down in the mid-6's and travelled to knock on the 10K ceiling- some swingers more than doubled their money just by holding ETH or BCH for a month. This is an interesting and bizarre pattern to look at because finding the middle of it (ironically, the middle was around 6/6) seems to dictate where something will eventually shift and change by tracing the patterns to its end. Is it completely meaningless? I don't know. I tend to think that the February bottom was too quick / merely a test, the April bottom was barely enough accumulation and if this does end up being a bottom soon it may give us sideways action lasting longer than we expected... which could also lead to failure and capitulation instead of another prolonged rally. I'm sharing this only because I see it.. not because it gives me direction. No advice here! Just some fun ideas as everyone is now wanting to turn  bullish . I do believe we deserve more accumulation in the 4-7K range before any sort of legitimate bull run can occur but don't assume we're going to get it. I am very open to to seeing this becoming a bottom. Is there anything better than a swinger showing you his or her bottom? ;)

Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever!

I hope that i have helped some people stay cool since we dropped 250points since than, its really important to stay cool at all times no matter if you making or loosing money because you will make bad decisions at those times, if you have problem with this set trading rules for yourself and buy some books on Psychology in Trading and it will help you become better trader. 
I treat Trading like a sport, feel like a athlete competing with others. If you want to be great at something you need to put more effort than anyone else, I constantly read new books on trading strategies, many of them are outdated written during DOTcom bubble but you can still learn a lot from them. 

Im here to help, brings me happiness to see those msgs about YOU guys learning, succeeding and becoming better traders. Keep them coming !! THANKS !!

It is by no means a reliable precedent but the last time symmetry from the March high ended we set our medium-term bottom down in the mid-6's and travelled to knock on the 10K ceiling- some swingers more than doubled their money just by holding ETH or BCH for a month. This is an interesting and bizarre pattern to look at because finding the middle of it (ironically, the middle was around 6/6) seems to dictate where something will eventually shift and change by tracing the patterns to its end. Is it completely meaningless? I don't know. I tend to think that the February bottom was too quick / merely a test, the April bottom was barely enough accumulation and if this does end up being a bottom soon it may give us sideways action lasting longer than we expected... which could also lead to failure and capitulation instead of another prolonged rally. I'm sharing this only because I see it.. not because it gives me direction. No advice here! Just some fun ideas as everyone is now wanting to turn  bullish . I do believe we deserve more accumulation in the 4-7K range before any sort of legitimate bull run can occur but don't assume we're going to get it. I am very open to to seeing this becoming a bottom. Is there anything better than a swinger showing you his or her bottom? ;)

Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever!

Yesterday i told you guys to watch for those ""TO THE MOON BUY NOW- Technical Analysis""  since many popped lately. 
I hope that i have helped some people stay cool since we dropped 250points since than, its really important to stay cool at all times no matter if you making or loosing money because you will make bad decisions at those times, if you have problem with this set trading rules for yourself and buy some books on Psychology in Trading and it will help you become better trader. 
I treat Trading like a sport, feel like a athlete competing with others. If you want to be great at something you need to put more effort than anyone else, I constantly read new books on trading strategies, many of them are outdated written during DOTcom bubble but you can still learn a lot from them. 

Im here to help, brings me happiness to see those msgs about YOU guys learning, succeeding and becoming better traders. Keep them coming !! THANKS !!

1530684502.0,InvestingScope,Lower High Rejection on the 1D Channel Down. Short.,"
Since the ""unfilled pattern"" (ellipse shape on the chart) the price changed its sequence and rose higher than the 6,446.20 1H Resistance. Still as you see it made a Lower High Rejection on the 1D Channel Down. 1H has already made a near 6,400 test ( RSI  = 38.785, Highs/Lows = -23.0500, B/BP = -69.0539) with  MACD  = -21.200 indicating that the SMA200 = 6,266.1 is its next and final target. As a result, that 4H Channel Up (caused by the ""unfilled pattern"") is now void ( ADX  = 22.847, B/BP  = -71.3297) and since the June 18 - 20 6,850 Highs were not reclaimed, 1D should look to fill the downside gap to 6,000 (essentially all its remaining MA period) again on a  MACD  = -199.900. Still sell mode with TP = 5,617.4 as 1W remains  bearish  overall (Highs/Lows = -77.2664, B/BP = -8412.8402,  MACD  = -448.700). According to the 1W curve since the 19,891.0  ATH -1.03% , the uptrend is limited to 7,712.60. We have already added the second short at 6,640 and will look for a final at 7,700 (if presented), but this scenario is highly unlikely.

Price changes like in kaleidoscope - You can turn and twist  BTC Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   chart and will find different formations and patterns and thatâ€™s why for now You are better off sticking to  support and resistance . 
As expected price fall from  rising wedge  but not much as stopped on 6400 support. Rejection candle suggest that there is a chance to go back to 6650 but we would love to see some more confirmation for that.  
Small price rise which we are experiencing now can be only temporary and most likely last up to 6550 level. 
If  BTC Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   breaks 6400 support next stop is 100$ lower at 6300. 
Some traders are looking for  Head and Shoulders  pattern at 6150 level but to see that formation we need price to drop to 6150 first and that means 300$ lower which is around 4.5% drop.

Just trying to work out where we are 
If this is just stretching a leg of the pattern out for a bit of up then the pattern remains 
If it was reversal then the pattern may change 
If it is caused by a big players withdrawal from the market then the pattern is caused by the algorithm and could change once that big player has left 
Could also be a load of nonsense, some say people who look hard enough can find a pattern even where a pattern does not exist

1530680690.0,CryptoComes,BTC/USD Starts Downside Correction,"
 Bitcoin Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   started a downside correction as the currency pair loses around two percent in the past 24 hours. However, we think that this correction is nothing more than just a pause of the uptrend as crypto market is still  bullish . Investors fixed their positions but they are likely to resume buying in the nearest future. 

BTC/USD had a  bullish Flag  pattern on Tuesday, but failed to develop its upside progress as the price reached the  support area  at $6,510 and tested it.  Bitcoin Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   jumped over this level, but still has opportunities to return above the resistance (which was the support previously). We can see a clear  Hammer candlestick  pattern on the Hourly chart meaning the currency pair is ready to grow in the nearest future. 
The closest targets for  Bitcoin Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   growth lie at the  resistance area  at $6,718. BTC/USD is likely to start growing towards this level on Wednesday. This is the main scenario for the next 24 hours. However, if bulls fail to drive the currency pair higher, we will become witnesses of a deeper downside correction aiming at the next  support area  at $6,329.

 Bitcoin -0.62%  started a downside correction as the currency pair loses around two percent in the past 24 hours.

		This is a deliberately simple chart. This distorted and skewed symmetry from recent months seems to be coming to an end soon. It is by no means a reliable precedent but the last time symmetry from the March high ended we set our medium-term bottom down in the mid-6's and travelled to knock on the 10K ceiling- some swingers more than doubled their money just by holding ETH or BCH for a month. This is an interesting and bizarre pattern to look at because finding the middle of it (ironically, the middle was around 6/6) seems to dictate where something will eventually shift and change by tracing the patterns to its end. Is it completely meaningless? I don't know. I tend to think that the February bottom was too quick / merely a test, the April bottom was barely enough accumulation and if this does end up being a bottom soon it may give us sideways action lasting longer than we expected... which could also lead to failure and capitulation instead of another prolonged rally. I'm sharing this only because I see it.. not because it gives me direction. No advice here! Just some fun ideas as everyone is now wanting to turn  bullish . I do believe we deserve more accumulation in the 4-7K range before any sort of legitimate bull run can occur but don't assume we're going to get it. I am very open to to seeing this becoming a bottom. Is there anything better than a swinger showing you his or her bottom? ;)

Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin -0.62%  pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc -0.62%  always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever! 

Keep it Real!

Yesterday i told you guys to watch for those ""TO THE MOON BUY NOW- Technical Analysis""  since many popped lately. 
I hope that i have helped some people stay cool since we dropped 250points since than, its really important to stay cool at all times no matter if you making or loosing money because you will make bad decisions at those times, if you have problem with this set trading rules for yourself and buy some books on Psychology in Trading and it will help you become better trader. 
I treat Trading like a sport, feel like a athlete competing with others. If you want to be great at something you need to put more effort than anyone else, I constantly read new books on trading strategies, many of them are outdated written during DOTcom bubble but you can still learn a lot from them. 

Im here to help, brings me happiness to see those msgs about YOU guys learning, succeeding and becoming better traders. Keep them coming !! THANKS !! 

Good Luck All !! Happy 4th !!

Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever!

Since the ""unfilled pattern"" (ellipse shape on the chart) the price changed its sequence and rose higher than the 6,446.20 1H Resistance. Still as you see it made a Lower High Rejection on the 1D Channel Down. 1H has already made a near 6,400 test ( RSI  = 38.785, Highs/Lows = -23.0500, B/BP = -69.0539) with  MACD  = -21.200 indicating that the SMA200 = 6,266.1 is its next and final target. As a result, that 4H Channel Up (caused by the ""unfilled pattern"") is now void ( ADX  = 22.847, B/BP  = -71.3297) and since the June 18 - 20 6,850 Highs were not reclaimed, 1D should look to fill the downside gap to 6,000 (essentially all its remaining MA period) again on a  MACD  = -199.900. Still sell mode with TP = 5,617.4 as 1W remains  bearish  overall (Highs/Lows = -77.2664, B/BP = -8412.8402,  MACD  = -448.700). According to the 1W curve since the 19,891.0  ATH -1.03% , the uptrend is limited to 7,712.60. We have already added the second short at 6,640 and will look for a final at 7,700 (if presented), but this scenario is highly unlikely.

Price changes like in kaleidoscope - You can turn and twist  BTC -0.62%  chart and will find different formations and patterns and thatâ€™s why for now You are better off sticking to  support and resistance . 
As expected price fall from  rising wedge  but not much as stopped on 6400 support. Rejection candle suggest that there is a chance to go back to 6650 but we would love to see some more confirmation for that.  
Small price rise which we are experiencing now can be only temporary and most likely last up to 6550 level. 
If  BTC -0.62%  breaks 6400 support next stop is 100$ lower at 6300. 
Some traders are looking for  Head and Shoulders  pattern at 6150 level but to see that formation we need price to drop to 6150 first and that means 300$ lower which is around 4.5% drop.

If this is just stretching a leg of the pattern out for a bit of up then the pattern remains 
If it was reversal then the pattern may change 
If it is caused by a big players withdrawal from the market then the pattern is caused by the algorithm and could change once that big player has left 
Could also be a load of nonsense, some say people who look hard enough can find a pattern even where a pattern does not exist

 Bitcoin -0.62%  started a downside correction as the currency pair loses around two percent in the past 24 hours. However, we think that this correction is nothing more than just a pause of the uptrend as crypto market is still  bullish . Investors fixed their positions but they are likely to resume buying in the nearest future. 

BTC/USD had a  bullish Flag  pattern on Tuesday, but failed to develop its upside progress as the price reached the  support area  at $6,510 and tested it.  Bitcoin -0.62%  jumped over this level, but still has opportunities to return above the resistance (which was the support previously). We can see a clear  Hammer candlestick  pattern on the Hourly chart meaning the currency pair is ready to grow in the nearest future. 
The closest targets for  Bitcoin -0.62%  growth lie at the  resistance area  at $6,718. BTC/USD is likely to start growing towards this level on Wednesday. This is the main scenario for the next 24 hours. However, if bulls fail to drive the currency pair higher, we will become witnesses of a deeper downside correction aiming at the next  support area  at $6,329.

		This is a deliberately simple chart. This distorted and skewed symmetry from recent months seems to be coming to an end soon. It is by no means a reliable precedent but the last time symmetry from the March high ended we set our medium-term bottom down in the mid-6's and travelled to knock on the 10K ceiling- some swingers more than doubled their money just by holding ETH or BCH for a month. This is an interesting and bizarre pattern to look at because finding the middle of it (ironically, the middle was around 6/6) seems to dictate where something will eventually shift and change by tracing the patterns to its end. Is it completely meaningless? I don't know. I tend to think that the February bottom was too quick / merely a test, the April bottom was barely enough accumulation and if this does end up being a bottom soon it may give us sideways action lasting longer than we expected... which could also lead to failure and capitulation instead of another prolonged rally. I'm sharing this only because I see it.. not because it gives me direction. No advice here! Just some fun ideas as everyone is now wanting to turn  bullish . I do believe we deserve more accumulation in the 4-7K range before any sort of legitimate bull run can occur but don't assume we're going to get it. I am very open to to seeing this becoming a bottom. Is there anything better than a swinger showing you his or her bottom? ;)

As expected price fall from  rising wedge  but not much as stopped on 6400 support. Rejection candle suggest that there is a chance to go back to 6650 but we would love to see some more confirmation for that.  
Small price rise which we are experiencing now can be only temporary and most likely last up to 6550 level.

 Bitcoin -0.62%  started a downside correction as the currency pair loses around two percent in the past 24 hours. However, we think that this correction is nothing more than just a pause of the uptrend as crypto market is still  bullish . Investors fixed their positions but they are likely to resume buying in the nearest future. 

BTC/USD had a  bullish Flag  pattern on Tuesday, but failed to develop its upside progress as the price reached the  support area  at $6,510 and tested it.  Bitcoin -0.62%  jumped over this level, but still has opportunities to return above the resistance (which was the support previously). We can see a clear  Hammer candlestick  pattern on the Hourly chart meaning the currency pair is ready to grow in the nearest future. 
The closest targets for  Bitcoin -0.62%  growth lie at the  resistance area  at $6,718. BTC/USD is likely to start growing towards this level on Wednesday. This is the main scenario for the next 24 hours. However, if bulls fail to drive the currency pair higher, we will become witnesses of a deeper downside correction aiming at the next  support area  at $6,329.

		This is a deliberately simple chart. This distorted and skewed symmetry from recent months seems to be coming to an end soon. It is by no means a reliable precedent but the last time symmetry from the March high ended we set our medium-term bottom down in the mid-6's and travelled to knock on the 10K ceiling- some swingers more than doubled their money just by holding ETH or BCH for a month. This is an interesting and bizarre pattern to look at because finding the middle of it (ironically, the middle was around 6/6) seems to dictate where something will eventually shift and change by tracing the patterns to its end. Is it completely meaningless? I don't know. I tend to think that the February bottom was too quick / merely a test, the April bottom was barely enough accumulation and if this does end up being a bottom soon it may give us sideways action lasting longer than we expected... which could also lead to failure and capitulation instead of another prolonged rally. I'm sharing this only because I see it.. not because it gives me direction. No advice here! Just some fun ideas as everyone is now wanting to turn  bullish . I do believe we deserve more accumulation in the 4-7K range before any sort of legitimate bull run can occur but don't assume we're going to get it. I am very open to to seeing this becoming a bottom. Is there anything better than a swinger showing you his or her bottom? ;)

Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin -0.62%  pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc -0.62%  always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever! 

Keep it Real!

Hello ! 
Everything Explained in Video !! 



Yesterday i told you guys to watch for those ""TO THE MOON BUY NOW- Technical Analysis""  since many popped lately. 
I hope that i have helped some people stay cool since we dropped 250points since than, its really important to stay cool at all times no matter if you making or loosing money because you will make bad decisions at those times, if you have problem with this set trading rules for yourself and buy some books on Psychology in Trading and it will help you become better trader. 
I treat Trading like a sport, feel like a athlete competing with others. If you want to be great at something you need to put more effort than anyone else, I constantly read new books on trading strategies, many of them are outdated written during DOTcom bubble but you can still learn a lot from them. 

Im here to help, brings me happiness to see those msgs about YOU guys learning, succeeding and becoming better traders. Keep them coming !! THANKS !! 

Good Luck All !! Happy 4th !!

1530684502.0,InvestingScope,Lower High Rejection on the 1D Channel Down. Short.,"
Since the ""unfilled pattern"" (ellipse shape on the chart) the price changed its sequence and rose higher than the 6,446.20 1H Resistance. Still as you see it made a Lower High Rejection on the 1D Channel Down. 1H has already made a near 6,400 test ( RSI  = 38.785, Highs/Lows = -23.0500, B/BP = -69.0539) with  MACD  = -21.200 indicating that the SMA200 = 6,266.1 is its next and final target. As a result, that 4H Channel Up (caused by the ""unfilled pattern"") is now void ( ADX  = 22.847, B/BP  = -71.3297) and since the June 18 - 20 6,850 Highs were not reclaimed, 1D should look to fill the downside gap to 6,000 (essentially all its remaining MA period) again on a  MACD  = -199.900. Still sell mode with TP = 5,617.4 as 1W remains  bearish  overall (Highs/Lows = -77.2664, B/BP = -8412.8402,  MACD  = -448.700). According to the 1W curve since the 19,891.0  ATH -1.03% , the uptrend is limited to 7,712.60. We have already added the second short at 6,640 and will look for a final at 7,700 (if presented), but this scenario is highly unlikely.

Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin -0.62%  pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc -0.62%  always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever!

Since the ""unfilled pattern"" (ellipse shape on the chart) the price changed its sequence and rose higher than the 6,446.20 1H Resistance.

Still sell mode with TP = 5,617.4 as 1W remains  bearish  overall (Highs/Lows = -77.2664, B/BP = -8412.8402,  MACD  = -448.700). According to the 1W curve since the 19,891.0  ATH -1.03% , the uptrend is limited to 7,712.60.

If this is just stretching a leg of the pattern out for a bit of up then the pattern remains 
If it was reversal then the pattern may change 
If it is caused by a big players withdrawal from the market then the pattern is caused by the algorithm and could change once that big player has left 
Could also be a load of nonsense, some say people who look hard enough can find a pattern even where a pattern does not exist

 Bitcoin -0.62%  started a downside correction as the currency pair loses around two percent in the past 24 hours. However, we think that this correction is nothing more than just a pause of the uptrend as crypto market is still  bullish . Investors fixed their positions but they are likely to resume buying in the nearest future. 

BTC/USD had a  bullish Flag  pattern on Tuesday, but failed to develop its upside progress as the price reached the  support area  at $6,510 and tested it.  Bitcoin -0.62%  jumped over this level, but still has opportunities to return above the resistance (which was the support previously). We can see a clear  Hammer candlestick  pattern on the Hourly chart meaning the currency pair is ready to grow in the nearest future. 
The closest targets for  Bitcoin -0.62%  growth lie at the  resistance area  at $6,718. BTC/USD is likely to start growing towards this level on Wednesday. This is the main scenario for the next 24 hours. However, if bulls fail to drive the currency pair higher, we will become witnesses of a deeper downside correction aiming at the next  support area  at $6,329.

		This is a deliberately simple chart. This distorted and skewed symmetry from recent months seems to be coming to an end soon. It is by no means a reliable precedent but the last time symmetry from the March high ended we set our medium-term bottom down in the mid-6's and travelled to knock on the 10K ceiling- some swingers more than doubled their money just by holding ETH or BCH for a month. This is an interesting and bizarre pattern to look at because finding the middle of it (ironically, the middle was around 6/6) seems to dictate where something will eventually shift and change by tracing the patterns to its end. Is it completely meaningless? I don't know. I tend to think that the February bottom was too quick / merely a test, the April bottom was barely enough accumulation and if this does end up being a bottom soon it may give us sideways action lasting longer than we expected... which could also lead to failure and capitulation instead of another prolonged rally. I'm sharing this only because I see it.. not because it gives me direction. No advice here! Just some fun ideas as everyone is now wanting to turn  bullish . I do believe we deserve more accumulation in the 4-7K range before any sort of legitimate bull run can occur but don't assume we're going to get it. I am very open to to seeing this becoming a bottom. Is there anything better than a swinger showing you his or her bottom? ;)

		This is a deliberately simple chart. This distorted and skewed symmetry from recent months seems to be coming to an end soon. It is by no means a reliable precedent but the last time symmetry from the March high ended we set our medium-term bottom down in the mid-6's and travelled to knock on the 10K ceiling- some swingers more than doubled their money just by holding ETH or BCH for a month. This is an interesting and bizarre pattern to look at because finding the middle of it (ironically, the middle was around 6/6) seems to dictate where something will eventually shift and change by tracing the patterns to its end. Is it completely meaningless? I don't know. I tend to think that the February bottom was too quick / merely a test, the April bottom was barely enough accumulation and if this does end up being a bottom soon it may give us sideways action lasting longer than we expected... which could also lead to failure and capitulation instead of another prolonged rally. I'm sharing this only because I see it.. not because it gives me direction. No advice here! Just some fun ideas as everyone is now wanting to turn  bullish . I do believe we deserve more accumulation in the 4-7K range before any sort of legitimate bull run can occur but don't assume we're going to get it. I am very open to to seeing this becoming a bottom. Is there anything better than a swinger showing you his or her bottom? ;)

Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin -0.62%  pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc -0.62%  always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever!

Hello !

Yesterday i told you guys to watch for those ""TO THE MOON BUY NOW- Technical Analysis""  since many popped lately. 
I hope that i have helped some people stay cool since we dropped 250points since than, its really important to stay cool at all times no matter if you making or loosing money because you will make bad decisions at those times, if you have problem with this set trading rules for yourself and buy some books on Psychology in Trading and it will help you become better trader. 
I treat Trading like a sport, feel like a athlete competing with others. If you want to be great at something you need to put more effort than anyone else, I constantly read new books on trading strategies, many of them are outdated written during DOTcom bubble but you can still learn a lot from them. 

Im here to help, brings me happiness to see those msgs about YOU guys learning, succeeding and becoming better traders. Keep them coming !! THANKS !! 

Good Luck All !! Happy 4th !!

Since the ""unfilled pattern"" (ellipse shape on the chart) the price changed its sequence and rose higher than the 6,446.20 1H Resistance. Still as you see it made a Lower High Rejection on the 1D Channel Down. 1H has already made a near 6,400 test ( RSI  = 38.785, Highs/Lows = -23.0500, B/BP = -69.0539) with  MACD  = -21.200 indicating that the SMA200 = 6,266.1 is its next and final target. As a result, that 4H Channel Up (caused by the ""unfilled pattern"") is now void ( ADX  = 22.847, B/BP  = -71.3297) and since the June 18 - 20 6,850 Highs were not reclaimed, 1D should look to fill the downside gap to 6,000 (essentially all its remaining MA period) again on a  MACD  = -199.900. Still sell mode with TP = 5,617.4 as 1W remains  bearish  overall (Highs/Lows = -77.2664, B/BP = -8412.8402,  MACD  = -448.700). According to the 1W curve since the 19,891.0  ATH -1.03% , the uptrend is limited to 7,712.60. We have already added the second short at 6,640 and will look for a final at 7,700 (if presented), but this scenario is highly unlikely.

Since the ""unfilled pattern"" (ellipse shape on the chart) the price changed its sequence and rose higher than the 6,446.20 1H Resistance.

Still sell mode with TP = 5,617.4 as 1W remains  bearish  overall (Highs/Lows = -77.2664, B/BP = -8412.8402,  MACD  = -448.700). According to the 1W curve since the 19,891.0  ATH -1.03% , the uptrend is limited to 7,712.60.

 Bitcoin -0.62%  started a downside correction as the currency pair loses around two percent in the past 24 hours. However, we think that this correction is nothing more than just a pause of the uptrend as crypto market is still  bullish . Investors fixed their positions but they are likely to resume buying in the nearest future. 

BTC/USD had a  bullish Flag  pattern on Tuesday, but failed to develop its upside progress as the price reached the  support area  at $6,510 and tested it.  Bitcoin -0.62%  jumped over this level, but still has opportunities to return above the resistance (which was the support previously). We can see a clear  Hammer candlestick  pattern on the Hourly chart meaning the currency pair is ready to grow in the nearest future. 
The closest targets for  Bitcoin -0.62%  growth lie at the  resistance area  at $6,718. BTC/USD is likely to start growing towards this level on Wednesday. This is the main scenario for the next 24 hours. However, if bulls fail to drive the currency pair higher, we will become witnesses of a deeper downside correction aiming at the next  support area  at $6,329.

		This is a deliberately simple chart. This distorted and skewed symmetry from recent months seems to be coming to an end soon. It is by no means a reliable precedent but the last time symmetry from the March high ended we set our medium-term bottom down in the mid-6's and travelled to knock on the 10K ceiling- some swingers more than doubled their money just by holding ETH or BCH for a month. This is an interesting and bizarre pattern to look at because finding the middle of it (ironically, the middle was around 6/6) seems to dictate where something will eventually shift and change by tracing the patterns to its end. Is it completely meaningless? I don't know. I tend to think that the February bottom was too quick / merely a test, the April bottom was barely enough accumulation and if this does end up being a bottom soon it may give us sideways action lasting longer than we expected... which could also lead to failure and capitulation instead of another prolonged rally. I'm sharing this only because I see it.. not because it gives me direction. No advice here! Just some fun ideas as everyone is now wanting to turn  bullish . I do believe we deserve more accumulation in the 4-7K range before any sort of legitimate bull run can occur but don't assume we're going to get it. I am very open to to seeing this becoming a bottom. Is there anything better than a swinger showing you his or her bottom? ;)

Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin -0.59%  pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc -0.59%  always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever!

 Bitcoin -0.55%  started a downside correction as the currency pair loses around two percent in the past 24 hours. However, we think that this correction is nothing more than just a pause of the uptrend as crypto market is still  bullish . Investors fixed their positions but they are likely to resume buying in the nearest future. 

BTC/USD had a  bullish Flag  pattern on Tuesday, but failed to develop its upside progress as the price reached the  support area  at $6,510 and tested it.  Bitcoin -0.55%  jumped over this level, but still has opportunities to return above the resistance (which was the support previously). We can see a clear  Hammer candlestick  pattern on the Hourly chart meaning the currency pair is ready to grow in the nearest future. 
The closest targets for  Bitcoin -0.55%  growth lie at the  resistance area  at $6,718. BTC/USD is likely to start growing towards this level on Wednesday. This is the main scenario for the next 24 hours. However, if bulls fail to drive the currency pair higher, we will become witnesses of a deeper downside correction aiming at the next  support area  at $6,329.

		This is a deliberately simple chart. This distorted and skewed symmetry from recent months seems to be coming to an end soon. It is by no means a reliable precedent but the last time symmetry from the March high ended we set our medium-term bottom down in the mid-6's and travelled to knock on the 10K ceiling- some swingers more than doubled their money just by holding ETH or BCH for a month. This is an interesting and bizarre pattern to look at because finding the middle of it (ironically, the middle was around 6/6) seems to dictate where something will eventually shift and change by tracing the patterns to its end. Is it completely meaningless? I don't know. I tend to think that the February bottom was too quick / merely a test, the April bottom was barely enough accumulation and if this does end up being a bottom soon it may give us sideways action lasting longer than we expected... which could also lead to failure and capitulation instead of another prolonged rally. I'm sharing this only because I see it.. not because it gives me direction. No advice here! Just some fun ideas as everyone is now wanting to turn  bullish . I do believe we deserve more accumulation in the 4-7K range before any sort of legitimate bull run can occur but don't assume we're going to get it. I am very open to to seeing this becoming a bottom. Is there anything better than a swinger showing you his or her bottom? ;)

Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin -0.55%  pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc -0.55%  always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever!

Hello ! 
Everything Explained in Video !! 



Yesterday i told you guys to watch for those ""TO THE MOON BUY NOW- Technical Analysis""  since many popped lately. 
I hope that i have helped some people stay cool since we dropped 250points since than, its really important to stay cool at all times no matter if you making or loosing money because you will make bad decisions at those times, if you have problem with this set trading rules for yourself and buy some books on Psychology in Trading and it will help you become better trader. 
I treat Trading like a sport, feel like a athlete competing with others. If you want to be great at something you need to put more effort than anyone else, I constantly read new books on trading strategies, many of them are outdated written during DOTcom bubble but you can still learn a lot from them. 

Im here to help, brings me happiness to see those msgs about YOU guys learning, succeeding and becoming better traders. Keep them coming !! THANKS !! 

Good Luck All !! Happy 4th !!

Since the ""unfilled pattern"" (ellipse shape on the chart) the price changed its sequence and rose higher than the 6,446.20 1H Resistance. Still as you see it made a Lower High Rejection on the 1D Channel Down. 1H has already made a near 6,400 test ( RSI  = 38.785, Highs/Lows = -23.0500, B/BP = -69.0539) with  MACD  = -21.200 indicating that the SMA200 = 6,266.1 is its next and final target. As a result, that 4H Channel Up (caused by the ""unfilled pattern"") is now void ( ADX  = 22.847, B/BP  = -71.3297) and since the June 18 - 20 6,850 Highs were not reclaimed, 1D should look to fill the downside gap to 6,000 (essentially all its remaining MA period) again on a  MACD  = -199.900. Still sell mode with TP = 5,617.4 as 1W remains  bearish  overall (Highs/Lows = -77.2664, B/BP = -8412.8402,  MACD  = -448.700). According to the 1W curve since the 19,891.0  ATH -1.03% , the uptrend is limited to 7,712.60. We have already added the second short at 6,640 and will look for a final at 7,700 (if presented), but this scenario is highly unlikely.

Price changes like in kaleidoscope - You can turn and twist  BTC -0.56%  chart and will find different formations and patterns and thatâ€™s why for now You are better off sticking to  support and resistance . 
As expected price fall from  rising wedge  but not much as stopped on 6400 support. Rejection candle suggest that there is a chance to go back to 6650 but we would love to see some more confirmation for that.  
Small price rise which we are experiencing now can be only temporary and most likely last up to 6550 level. 
If  BTC -0.56%  breaks 6400 support next stop is 100$ lower at 6300. 
Some traders are looking for  Head and Shoulders  pattern at 6150 level but to see that formation we need price to drop to 6150 first and that means 300$ lower which is around 4.5% drop.

Yesterday i told you guys to watch for those ""TO THE MOON BUY NOW- Technical Analysis""  since many popped lately. 
I hope that i have helped some people stay cool since we dropped 250points since than, its really important to stay cool at all times no matter if you making or loosing money because you will make bad decisions at those times, if you have problem with this set trading rules for yourself and buy some books on Psychology in Trading and it will help you become better trader. 
I treat Trading like a sport, feel like a athlete competing with others. If you want to be great at something you need to put more effort than anyone else, I constantly read new books on trading strategies, many of them are outdated written during DOTcom bubble but you can still learn a lot from them. 

Im here to help, brings me happiness to see those msgs about YOU guys learning, succeeding and becoming better traders. Keep them coming !! THANKS !! 

Good Luck All !! Happy 4th !!

Since the ""unfilled pattern"" (ellipse shape on the chart) the price changed its sequence and rose higher than the 6,446.20 1H Resistance. Still as you see it made a Lower High Rejection on the 1D Channel Down. 1H has already made a near 6,400 test ( RSI  = 38.785, Highs/Lows = -23.0500, B/BP = -69.0539) with  MACD  = -21.200 indicating that the SMA200 = 6,266.1 is its next and final target. As a result, that 4H Channel Up (caused by the ""unfilled pattern"") is now void ( ADX  = 22.847, B/BP  = -71.3297) and since the June 18 - 20 6,850 Highs were not reclaimed, 1D should look to fill the downside gap to 6,000 (essentially all its remaining MA period) again on a  MACD  = -199.900. Still sell mode with TP = 5,617.4 as 1W remains  bearish  overall (Highs/Lows = -77.2664, B/BP = -8412.8402,  MACD  = -448.700). According to the 1W curve since the 19,891.0  ATH Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  , the uptrend is limited to 7,712.60. We have already added the second short at 6,640 and will look for a final at 7,700 (if presented), but this scenario is highly unlikely.

 Bitcoin Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   started a downside correction as the currency pair loses around two percent in the past 24 hours. However, we think that this correction is nothing more than just a pause of the uptrend as crypto market is still  bullish . Investors fixed their positions but they are likely to resume buying in the nearest future. 

BTC/USD had a  bullish Flag  pattern on Tuesday, but failed to develop its upside progress as the price reached the  support area  at $6,510 and tested it.  Bitcoin Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   jumped over this level, but still has opportunities to return above the resistance (which was the support previously). We can see a clear  Hammer candlestick  pattern on the Hourly chart meaning the currency pair is ready to grow in the nearest future. 
The closest targets for  Bitcoin Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   growth lie at the  resistance area  at $6,718. BTC/USD is likely to start growing towards this level on Wednesday. This is the main scenario for the next 24 hours. However, if bulls fail to drive the currency pair higher, we will become witnesses of a deeper downside correction aiming at the next  support area  at $6,329.

		This is a deliberately simple chart. This distorted and skewed symmetry from recent months seems to be coming to an end soon. It is by no means a reliable precedent but the last time symmetry from the March high ended we set our medium-term bottom down in the mid-6's and travelled to knock on the 10K ceiling- some swingers more than doubled their money just by holding ETH or BCH for a month. This is an interesting and bizarre pattern to look at because finding the middle of it (ironically, the middle was around 6/6) seems to dictate where something will eventually shift and change by tracing the patterns to its end. Is it completely meaningless? I don't know. I tend to think that the February bottom was too quick / merely a test, the April bottom was barely enough accumulation and if this does end up being a bottom soon it may give us sideways action lasting longer than we expected... which could also lead to failure and capitulation instead of another prolonged rally. I'm sharing this only because I see it.. not because it gives me direction. No advice here! Just some fun ideas as everyone is now wanting to turn  bullish . I do believe we deserve more accumulation in the 4-7K range before any sort of legitimate bull run can occur but don't assume we're going to get it. I am very open to to seeing this becoming a bottom. Is there anything better than a swinger showing you his or her bottom? ;)

Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin -0.53%  pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc -0.53%  always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever!

		This is a deliberately simple chart. This distorted and skewed symmetry from recent months seems to be coming to an end soon. It is by no means a reliable precedent but the last time symmetry from the March high ended we set our medium-term bottom down in the mid-6's and travelled to knock on the 10K ceiling- some swingers more than doubled their money just by holding ETH or BCH for a month. This is an interesting and bizarre pattern to look at because finding the middle of it (ironically, the middle was around 6/6) seems to dictate where something will eventually shift and change by tracing the patterns to its end. Is it completely meaningless? I don't know. I tend to think that the February bottom was too quick / merely a test, the April bottom was barely enough accumulation and if this does end up being a bottom soon it may give us sideways action lasting longer than we expected... which could also lead to failure and capitulation instead of another prolonged rally. I'm sharing this only because I see it.. not because it gives me direction. No advice here! Just some fun ideas as everyone is now wanting to turn  bullish . I do believe we deserve more accumulation in the 4-7K range before any sort of legitimate bull run can occur but don't assume we're going to get it.

Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin -0.54%  pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc -0.54%  always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever!

Hello ! 
Everything Explained in Video !! 



Yesterday i told you guys to watch for those ""TO THE MOON BUY NOW- Technical Analysis""  since many popped lately. 
I hope that i have helped some people stay cool since we dropped 250points since than, its really important to stay cool at all times no matter if you making or loosing money because you will make bad decisions at those times, if you have problem with this set trading rules for yourself and buy some books on Psychology in Trading and it will help you become better trader. 
I treat Trading like a sport, feel like a athlete competing with others. If you want to be great at something you need to put more effort than anyone else, I constantly read new books on trading strategies, many of them are outdated written during DOTcom bubble but you can still learn a lot from them. 

Im here to help, brings me happiness to see those msgs about YOU guys learning, succeeding and becoming better traders. Keep them coming !! THANKS !! 

Good Luck All !! Happy 4th !!

Since the ""unfilled pattern"" (ellipse shape on the chart) the price changed its sequence and rose higher than the 6,446.20 1H Resistance. Still as you see it made a Lower High Rejection on the 1D Channel Down. 1H has already made a near 6,400 test ( RSI  = 38.785, Highs/Lows = -23.0500, B/BP = -69.0539) with  MACD  = -21.200 indicating that the SMA200 = 6,266.1 is its next and final target. As a result, that 4H Channel Up (caused by the ""unfilled pattern"") is now void ( ADX  = 22.847, B/BP  = -71.3297) and since the June 18 - 20 6,850 Highs were not reclaimed, 1D should look to fill the downside gap to 6,000 (essentially all its remaining MA period) again on a  MACD  = -199.900. Still sell mode with TP = 5,617.4 as 1W remains  bearish  overall (Highs/Lows = -77.2664, B/BP = -8412.8402,  MACD  = -448.700). According to the 1W curve since the 19,891.0  ATH -1.03% , the uptrend is limited to 7,712.60. We have already added the second short at 6,640 and will look for a final at 7,700 (if presented), but this scenario is highly unlikely.

Price changes like in kaleidoscope - You can turn and twist  BTC -0.54%  chart and will find different formations and patterns and thatâ€™s why for now You are better off sticking to  support and resistance . 
As expected price fall from  rising wedge  but not much as stopped on 6400 support. Rejection candle suggest that there is a chance to go back to 6650 but we would love to see some more confirmation for that.  
Small price rise which we are experiencing now can be only temporary and most likely last up to 6550 level. 
If  BTC -0.54%  breaks 6400 support next stop is 100$ lower at 6300. 
Some traders are looking for  Head and Shoulders  pattern at 6150 level but to see that formation we need price to drop to 6150 first and that means 300$ lower which is around 4.5% drop.

Just trying to work out where we are 
If this is just stretching a leg of the pattern out for a bit of up then the pattern remains 
If it was reversal then the pattern may change 
If it is caused by a big players withdrawal from the market then the pattern is caused by the algorithm and could change once that big player has left 
Could also be a load of nonsense, some say people who look hard enough can find a pattern even where a pattern does not exist

Since the ""unfilled pattern"" (ellipse shape on the chart) the price changed its sequence and rose higher than the 6,446.20 1H Resistance. Still as you see it made a Lower High Rejection on the 1D Channel Down. 1H has already made a near 6,400 test ( RSI  = 38.785, Highs/Lows = -23.0500, B/BP = -69.0539) with  MACD  = -21.200 indicating that the SMA200 = 6,266.1 is its next and final target. As a result, that 4H Channel Up (caused by the ""unfilled pattern"") is now void ( ADX  = 22.847, B/BP  = -71.3297) and since the June 18 - 20 6,850 Highs were not reclaimed, 1D should look to fill the downside gap to 6,000 (essentially all its remaining MA period) again on a  MACD  = -199.900. Still sell mode with TP = 5,617.4 as 1W remains  bearish  overall (Highs/Lows = -77.2664, B/BP = -8412.8402,  MACD  = -448.700). According to the 1W curve since the 19,891.0  ATH -1.03% , the uptrend is limited to 7,712.60. We have already added the second short at 6,640 and will look for a final at 7,700 (if presented), but this scenario is highly unlikely.

As expected price fall from  rising wedge  but not much as stopped on 6400 support. Rejection candle suggest that there is a chance to go back to 6650 but we would love to see some more confirmation for that.

		This is a deliberately simple chart. This distorted and skewed symmetry from recent months seems to be coming to an end soon. It is by no means a reliable precedent but the last time symmetry from the March high ended we set our medium-term bottom down in the mid-6's and travelled to knock on the 10K ceiling- some swingers more than doubled their money just by holding ETH or BCH for a month. This is an interesting and bizarre pattern to look at because finding the middle of it (ironically, the middle was around 6/6) seems to dictate where something will eventually shift and change by tracing the patterns to its end. Is it completely meaningless? I don't know. I tend to think that the February bottom was too quick / merely a test, the April bottom was barely enough accumulation and if this does end up being a bottom soon it may give us sideways action lasting longer than we expected... which could also lead to failure and capitulation instead of another prolonged rally. I'm sharing this only because I see it.. not because it gives me direction. No advice here! Just some fun ideas as everyone is now wanting to turn  bullish . I do believe we deserve more accumulation in the 4-7K range before any sort of legitimate bull run can occur but don't assume we're going to get it. I am very open to to seeing this becoming a bottom. Is there anything better than a swinger showing you his or her bottom? ;)

1530679059.0,Keep-it-Real,BITCOIN NEVER HAVE SEEN THESE MUCH RESISTANCE!,"
Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin -0.55%  pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc -0.55%  always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever! 

Keep it Real!

		This is a deliberately simple chart. This distorted and skewed symmetry from recent months seems to be coming to an end soon. It is by no means a reliable precedent but the last time symmetry from the March high ended we set our medium-term bottom down in the mid-6's and travelled to knock on the 10K ceiling- some swingers more than doubled their money just by holding ETH or BCH for a month. This is an interesting and bizarre pattern to look at because finding the middle of it (ironically, the middle was around 6/6) seems to dictate where something will eventually shift and change by tracing the patterns to its end. Is it completely meaningless? I don't know. I tend to think that the February bottom was too quick / merely a test, the April bottom was barely enough accumulation and if this does end up being a bottom soon it may give us sideways action lasting longer than we expected... which could also lead to failure and capitulation instead of another prolonged rally. I'm sharing this only because I see it.. not because it gives me direction. No advice here! Just some fun ideas as everyone is now wanting to turn  bullish . I do believe we deserve more accumulation in the 4-7K range before any sort of legitimate bull run can occur but don't assume we're going to get it. I am very open to to seeing this becoming a bottom. Is there anything better than a swinger showing you his or her bottom? ;)

Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin -0.51%  pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc -0.51%  always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever!

I hope that i have helped some people stay cool since we dropped 250points since than, its really important to stay cool at all times no matter if you making or loosing money because you will make bad decisions at those times, if you have problem with this set trading rules for yourself and buy some books on Psychology in Trading and it will help you become better trader. 
I treat Trading like a sport, feel like a athlete competing with others. If you want to be great at something you need to put more effort than anyone else, I constantly read new books on trading strategies, many of them are outdated written during DOTcom bubble but you can still learn a lot from them.

Since the ""unfilled pattern"" (ellipse shape on the chart) the price changed its sequence and rose higher than the 6,446.20 1H Resistance. Still as you see it made a Lower High Rejection on the 1D Channel Down. 1H has already made a near 6,400 test ( RSI  = 38.785, Highs/Lows = -23.0500, B/BP = -69.0539) with  MACD  = -21.200 indicating that the SMA200 = 6,266.1 is its next and final target. As a result, that 4H Channel Up (caused by the ""unfilled pattern"") is now void ( ADX  = 22.847, B/BP  = -71.3297) and since the June 18 - 20 6,850 Highs were not reclaimed, 1D should look to fill the downside gap to 6,000 (essentially all its remaining MA period) again on a  MACD  = -199.900. Still sell mode with TP = 5,617.4 as 1W remains  bearish  overall (Highs/Lows = -77.2664, B/BP = -8412.8402,  MACD  = -448.700). According to the 1W curve since the 19,891.0  ATH -1.03% , the uptrend is limited to 7,712.60. We have already added the second short at 6,640 and will look for a final at 7,700 (if presented), but this scenario is highly unlikely.

Price changes like in kaleidoscope - You can turn and twist  BTC -0.51%  chart and will find different formations and patterns and thatâ€™s why for now You are better off sticking to  support and resistance . 
As expected price fall from  rising wedge  but not much as stopped on 6400 support. Rejection candle suggest that there is a chance to go back to 6650 but we would love to see some more confirmation for that.  
Small price rise which we are experiencing now can be only temporary and most likely last up to 6550 level. 
If  BTC -0.51%  breaks 6400 support next stop is 100$ lower at 6300. 
Some traders are looking for  Head and Shoulders  pattern at 6150 level but to see that formation we need price to drop to 6150 first and that means 300$ lower which is around 4.5% drop.

Just trying to work out where we are 
If this is just stretching a leg of the pattern out for a bit of up then the pattern remains 
If it was reversal then the pattern may change 
If it is caused by a big players withdrawal from the market then the pattern is caused by the algorithm and could change once that big player has left 
Could also be a load of nonsense, some say people who look hard enough can find a pattern even where a pattern does not exist

1530680690.0,CryptoComes,BTC/USD Starts Downside Correction,"
 Bitcoin -0.51%  started a downside correction as the currency pair loses around two percent in the past 24 hours. However, we think that this correction is nothing more than just a pause of the uptrend as crypto market is still  bullish . Investors fixed their positions but they are likely to resume buying in the nearest future. 

BTC/USD had a  bullish Flag  pattern on Tuesday, but failed to develop its upside progress as the price reached the  support area  at $6,510 and tested it.  Bitcoin -0.51%  jumped over this level, but still has opportunities to return above the resistance (which was the support previously). We can see a clear  Hammer candlestick  pattern on the Hourly chart meaning the currency pair is ready to grow in the nearest future. 
The closest targets for  Bitcoin -0.51%  growth lie at the  resistance area  at $6,718. BTC/USD is likely to start growing towards this level on Wednesday. This is the main scenario for the next 24 hours. However, if bulls fail to drive the currency pair higher, we will become witnesses of a deeper downside correction aiming at the next  support area  at $6,329.

Since the ""unfilled pattern"" (ellipse shape on the chart) the price changed its sequence and rose higher than the 6,446.20 1H Resistance. Still as you see it made a Lower High Rejection on the 1D Channel Down. 1H has already made a near 6,400 test ( RSI  = 38.785, Highs/Lows = -23.0500, B/BP = -69.0539) with  MACD  = -21.200 indicating that the SMA200 = 6,266.1 is its next and final target. As a result, that 4H Channel Up (caused by the ""unfilled pattern"") is now void ( ADX  = 22.847, B/BP  = -71.3297) and since the June 18 - 20 6,850 Highs were not reclaimed, 1D should look to fill the downside gap to 6,000 (essentially all its remaining MA period) again on a  MACD  = -199.900. Still sell mode with TP = 5,617.4 as 1W remains  bearish  overall (Highs/Lows = -77.2664, B/BP = -8412.8402,  MACD  = -448.700). According to the 1W curve since the 19,891.0  ATH -1.03% , the uptrend is limited to 7,712.60. We have already added the second short at 6,640 and will look for a final at 7,700 (if presented), but this scenario is highly unlikely.

As expected price fall from  rising wedge  but not much as stopped on 6400 support. Rejection candle suggest that there is a chance to go back to 6650 but we would love to see some more confirmation for that.

 Bitcoin -0.39%  started a downside correction as the currency pair loses around two percent in the past 24 hours. However, we think that this correction is nothing more than just a pause of the uptrend as crypto market is still  bullish . Investors fixed their positions but they are likely to resume buying in the nearest future. 

BTC/USD had a  bullish Flag  pattern on Tuesday, but failed to develop its upside progress as the price reached the  support area  at $6,510 and tested it.  Bitcoin -0.39%  jumped over this level, but still has opportunities to return above the resistance (which was the support previously). We can see a clear  Hammer candlestick  pattern on the Hourly chart meaning the currency pair is ready to grow in the nearest future. 
The closest targets for  Bitcoin -0.39%  growth lie at the  resistance area  at $6,718. BTC/USD is likely to start growing towards this level on Wednesday.

		This is a deliberately simple chart. This distorted and skewed symmetry from recent months seems to be coming to an end soon. It is by no means a reliable precedent but the last time symmetry from the March high ended we set our medium-term bottom down in the mid-6's and travelled to knock on the 10K ceiling- some swingers more than doubled their money just by holding ETH or BCH for a month. This is an interesting and bizarre pattern to look at because finding the middle of it (ironically, the middle was around 6/6) seems to dictate where something will eventually shift and change by tracing the patterns to its end. Is it completely meaningless? I don't know. I tend to think that the February bottom was too quick / merely a test, the April bottom was barely enough accumulation and if this does end up being a bottom soon it may give us sideways action lasting longer than we expected... which could also lead to failure and capitulation instead of another prolonged rally. I'm sharing this only because I see it.. not because it gives me direction. No advice here! Just some fun ideas as everyone is now wanting to turn  bullish . I do believe we deserve more accumulation in the 4-7K range before any sort of legitimate bull run can occur but don't assume we're going to get it. I am very open to to seeing this becoming a bottom. Is there anything better than a swinger showing you his or her bottom? ;)

Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin -0.43%  pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc -0.43%  always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever! 

Keep it Real!

Yesterday i told you guys to watch for those ""TO THE MOON BUY NOW- Technical Analysis""  since many popped lately. 
I hope that i have helped some people stay cool since we dropped 250points since than, its really important to stay cool at all times no matter if you making or loosing money because you will make bad decisions at those times, if you have problem with this set trading rules for yourself and buy some books on Psychology in Trading and it will help you become better trader. 
I treat Trading like a sport, feel like a athlete competing with others. If you want to be great at something you need to put more effort than anyone else, I constantly read new books on trading strategies, many of them are outdated written during DOTcom bubble but you can still learn a lot from them. 

Im here to help, brings me happiness to see those msgs about YOU guys learning, succeeding and becoming better traders. Keep them coming !! THANKS !! 

Good Luck All !! Happy 4th !!

Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever!

Since the ""unfilled pattern"" (ellipse shape on the chart) the price changed its sequence and rose higher than the 6,446.20 1H Resistance. Still as you see it made a Lower High Rejection on the 1D Channel Down. 1H has already made a near 6,400 test ( RSI  = 38.785, Highs/Lows = -23.0500, B/BP = -69.0539) with  MACD  = -21.200 indicating that the SMA200 = 6,266.1 is its next and final target. As a result, that 4H Channel Up (caused by the ""unfilled pattern"") is now void ( ADX  = 22.847, B/BP  = -71.3297) and since the June 18 - 20 6,850 Highs were not reclaimed, 1D should look to fill the downside gap to 6,000 (essentially all its remaining MA period) again on a  MACD  = -199.900. Still sell mode with TP = 5,617.4 as 1W remains  bearish  overall (Highs/Lows = -77.2664, B/BP = -8412.8402,  MACD  = -448.700). According to the 1W curve since the 19,891.0  ATH -1.03% , the uptrend is limited to 7,712.60. We have already added the second short at 6,640 and will look for a final at 7,700 (if presented), but this scenario is highly unlikely.

Price changes like in kaleidoscope - You can turn and twist  BTC Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   chart and will find different formations and patterns and thatâ€™s why for now You are better off sticking to  support and resistance . 
As expected price fall from  rising wedge  but not much as stopped on 6400 support. Rejection candle suggest that there is a chance to go back to 6650 but we would love to see some more confirmation for that.  
Small price rise which we are experiencing now can be only temporary and most likely last up to 6550 level. 
If  BTC Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   breaks 6400 support next stop is 100$ lower at 6300. 
Some traders are looking for  Head and Shoulders  pattern at 6150 level but to see that formation we need price to drop to 6150 first and that means 300$ lower which is around 4.5% drop.

If it was reversal then the pattern may change 
If it is caused by a big players withdrawal from the market then the pattern is caused by the algorithm and could change once that big player has left

1530680690.0,CryptoComes,BTC/USD Starts Downside Correction,"
 Bitcoin -0.38%  started a downside correction as the currency pair loses around two percent in the past 24 hours. However, we think that this correction is nothing more than just a pause of the uptrend as crypto market is still  bullish . Investors fixed their positions but they are likely to resume buying in the nearest future. 

BTC/USD had a  bullish Flag  pattern on Tuesday, but failed to develop its upside progress as the price reached the  support area  at $6,510 and tested it.  Bitcoin -0.38%  jumped over this level, but still has opportunities to return above the resistance (which was the support previously). We can see a clear  Hammer candlestick  pattern on the Hourly chart meaning the currency pair is ready to grow in the nearest future. 
The closest targets for  Bitcoin -0.38%  growth lie at the  resistance area  at $6,718. BTC/USD is likely to start growing towards this level on Wednesday. This is the main scenario for the next 24 hours. However, if bulls fail to drive the currency pair higher, we will become witnesses of a deeper downside correction aiming at the next  support area  at $6,329.

According to the 1W curve since the 19,891.0  ATH -1.03% , the uptrend is limited to 7,712.60.

		This is a deliberately simple chart. This distorted and skewed symmetry from recent months seems to be coming to an end soon. It is by no means a reliable precedent but the last time symmetry from the March high ended we set our medium-term bottom down in the mid-6's and travelled to knock on the 10K ceiling- some swingers more than doubled their money just by holding ETH or BCH for a month. This is an interesting and bizarre pattern to look at because finding the middle of it (ironically, the middle was around 6/6) seems to dictate where something will eventually shift and change by tracing the patterns to its end. Is it completely meaningless? I don't know. I tend to think that the February bottom was too quick / merely a test, the April bottom was barely enough accumulation and if this does end up being a bottom soon it may give us sideways action lasting longer than we expected... which could also lead to failure and capitulation instead of another prolonged rally. I'm sharing this only because I see it.. not because it gives me direction. No advice here! Just some fun ideas as everyone is now wanting to turn  bullish . I do believe we deserve more accumulation in the 4-7K range before any sort of legitimate bull run can occur but don't assume we're going to get it. I am very open to to seeing this becoming a bottom. Is there anything better than a swinger showing you his or her bottom? ;)

Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin -0.38%  pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc -0.38%  always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever!

Hello ! 
Everything Explained in Video !! 



Yesterday i told you guys to watch for those ""TO THE MOON BUY NOW- Technical Analysis""  since many popped lately. 
I hope that i have helped some people stay cool since we dropped 250points since than, its really important to stay cool at all times no matter if you making or loosing money because you will make bad decisions at those times, if you have problem with this set trading rules for yourself and buy some books on Psychology in Trading and it will help you become better trader. 
I treat Trading like a sport, feel like a athlete competing with others. If you want to be great at something you need to put more effort than anyone else, I constantly read new books on trading strategies, many of them are outdated written during DOTcom bubble but you can still learn a lot from them. 

Im here to help, brings me happiness to see those msgs about YOU guys learning, succeeding and becoming better traders. Keep them coming !! THANKS !! 

Good Luck All !! Happy 4th !!

		This is a deliberately simple chart. This distorted and skewed symmetry from recent months seems to be coming to an end soon. It is by no means a reliable precedent but the last time symmetry from the March high ended we set our medium-term bottom down in the mid-6's and travelled to knock on the 10K ceiling- some swingers more than doubled their money just by holding ETH or BCH for a month. This is an interesting and bizarre pattern to look at because finding the middle of it (ironically, the middle was around 6/6) seems to dictate where something will eventually shift and change by tracing the patterns to its end. Is it completely meaningless? I don't know. I tend to think that the February bottom was too quick / merely a test, the April bottom was barely enough accumulation and if this does end up being a bottom soon it may give us sideways action lasting longer than we expected... which could also lead to failure and capitulation instead of another prolonged rally. I'm sharing this only because I see it.. not because it gives me direction. No advice here! Just some fun ideas as everyone is now wanting to turn  bullish . I do believe we deserve more accumulation in the 4-7K range before any sort of legitimate bull run can occur but don't assume we're going to get it. I am very open to to seeing this becoming a bottom. Is there anything better than a swinger showing you his or her bottom? ;)

 BTC -0.38%  has been fun to play, if there is any analysts out there with a crystal ball they wouldnt be on Trading View :) We are still in a overall  bearish  market learn to adapt or stay sidelined with heavy confrimations we are thru. Good luck !

Yes guys, that's correct! Yes, I have seen  bitcoin -0.38%  pull backs - and big ones, nearly every year. Yes,  btc -0.38%  always recovered. Yes, FUD is real. BUT 6 months long pull back seems to be creating some resistance levels ahead. 

Where are these levels? 
Assuming we have a break from the massive triangle I have highlighted earlier (attn: highlighted before the break!), we have another small triangle formation creating a resistance around at $8,000. Breaking 8k will be big! and it might create much needed boost to break the $10,000! 

Why 8k resistance is important? 
Because that's the last triangle to be freed from so this might mean a confirmation of bull market $$$$ 

Then we have earlier highs $11,500 which might be a strong level and I would expect a heavy supply at this level. 

After liberating from $11,500 we will be entering a very volatile zone, with $11,000 becoming a support and $18,000 - 20,000 becoming the next resistance levels - and oh boy, there will be blood at this point! 

What will happen between 10k and 20k? Chop chop range will first slice then dice weaks with no mercy while we will be entering to a new AI era which money and the wealthy can live forever! 

Keep it Real!

I am still following this example to try and track future path so a ""Test"" should now be in order as described with the comparison to  EBAY -0.08%  2008/2009 chart?

Of course this is only my idea and the guy in the video and should not be taken as a reason to trade off!!!

Hello ! 
Everything Explained in Video !! 



Yesterday i told you guys to watch for those ""TO THE MOON BUY NOW- Technical Analysis""  since many popped lately. 
I hope that i have helped some people stay cool since we dropped 250points since than, its really important to stay cool at all times no matter if you making or loosing money because you will make bad decisions at those times, if you have problem with this set trading rules for yourself and buy some books on Psychology in Trading and it will help you become better trader. 
I treat Trading like a sport, feel like a athlete competing with others. If you want to be great at something you need to put more effort than anyone else, I constantly read new books on trading strategies, many of them are outdated written during DOTcom bubble but you can still learn a lot from them. 

Im here to help, brings me happiness to see those msgs about YOU guys learning, succeeding and becoming better traders. Keep them coming !! THANKS !! 

Good Luck All !! Happy 4th !!
