Comment:
					Keep in mind that this works only if Wave is V is aborted aka Flat or double bottom. 

This rally is good but we are still in bear, but close to getting the fuck out of it. 

We need more bank turmoils, and stock have to finally give way as FED tightening their positions. Basically FED is doing their best to stall stock rally via interest rate increase and tightening on loads and access to dollars.
