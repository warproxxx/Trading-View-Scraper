1530733692.0,SimonMercier,XRPUSD : bulls may rally on mid term,"
Hi guys, 

to follow up my past XRP projectio. Heres a macro point of view. I expect for 1-2 weeks that XRP will consolidate in our area. Testing major resitance with retracement to gather steam at support. 

Overall it looks like XRP could  double top  then start retracement : 








On a more macro view XRP start to expand which is a sign of a reversing momentum : 








The information we have is if XRP continue to behave like this. a  bullish  outcome may result :

This is a late entry, normal entry would have been on the  morning star  but this is still a profitable set up!  

Market retested the invester  head and shoulders  and now we're waiting for the new Higher High. 

Let's see how this goes!

Ripple has tested the lower limit of the negative trend channel. On that support it rebounded and is since then climbing. 
With the better sentiment of the market it should now rise upt to the upper limit of the trend channel. 
On the way up it has to cross a descending  trend line  (resistance). This will take some time possibly. 

RSI  confirms the new trend - it has crossed already the negative trend in the last days. 

The aim for Ripple in short term is 0.69$ - a benefit of 42% approx - on the base of 0,48$. 

Once Ripple will have broken out of the trend channel much higher prices are following. But this will be another analysis.

The rate of Ripple sharply bounced from the level of $ 0.52 downwards. 
Priority of the day: the growth of XRPUSD to $ 0.53. 
We forecast a small increase in the rate of Ripple to the target, after correction to the zone: $ 0.465 - $ 0.45. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.465 to $ 0.53. 
2. The XRPUSD rate may not exit flat and remain there. 
An alternative scenario: 
Since the trend is still  bearish , Ripple rate may continue its decline to $ 0.41.
