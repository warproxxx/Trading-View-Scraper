41 minutes ago




""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" quote by Arthur Conan Doyle from the Sherlock series.  

Let me start by discussing the boxed pattern. Believe you me, I dug into all timeframes trying to find the slightest reason to allow me to draw it as a 5 wave structure. But I can't; there is just now way to draw it other than a 3 wave structure. 

Now -  
We only have two possibilities to start:  
a) 3-3-3-3-3  leading diagonal  giving a  bullish  count 
b) 3-3-5 flat corrective pattern  
*obviously, a corrective pattern may unfold into combo waves, but there are only these two possibilities for the short term.  

Because of the daily dogi and the price action, along with major alts approaching critical levels and  RSI  breaching 65 ( bearish  reversal zone) on higher TFs, I am  bullish  biased.  

Unfortunately, my count of  leading diagonal  has been invalidated (more in update later). 
This leads me to believe we are in a 3-3-5 pattern whilst acknowledging all the  bullish  signals. 
A 3-3-5  ABC  count will give wave C an  ending diagonal  pattern. The diagonal's wave 3 will have  volume  bar confirmation as labelled.

I'm thinking a  double top  into a plummet down to 6135-6133 (making a sweet  inverse head and shoulders ) 

If you don't think it'll go down that far, check out the chart i posted before this one. It has higher entry targets.

Bitcoin's first moon trip is about to hit target (Fib 1.414).  Seeing price climb a measly 2.4% is so agonizing.  Alts are fairing much better this time around. I do not anticipate price to hold above the target. This rocket is done for... at least for now. The best is yet to come for  Bitcoin 2.39% . :)

After our recent successful trade in  Bitcoin             , we now need to reassess  Bitcoins              movements to best decide what to do next. If you remember from my last analysis, I expected a retest on support and a breakout move to the next  structure resistance  level. This trade went perfectly to plan and we was highly successful with this. Now that price is at the above horizontal  resistance zone , price is somewhat at a juncture. This is because not only is the uptrend slightly extended, but also because the target I chose was exactly where the 200 major moving average began to act as a resistance, which was also predicted in my previous analysis. For this reason, we must now be nimble before placing a long position in  Bitcoin              to avoid becoming part of a bull trap.  

Swiftly moving onto the grit of this analysis,  Bitcoin              is currently trading right at the horizontal  resistance zone , coinciding with the 200 major moving average resistance between 6930 and 6820. As it stands the  candlestick  looks strong showing there was a crisp  bullish  move to my target without much objection. What goes up must come down. Logic dictates that now price has hit the  resistance zone , it will need to catch it's breath again before a new pump. 

Price will now do one of 2 things before the next move.  

Firstly, price will correct from the horizontal  resistance zone  down to the side-wards support line, before bouncing off the line and using it as support, with a new upside move taking place. If this scenario happens, it shows the bigger buyers are still interested in pumping price and it is a safe bet, if, a little aggressive also. 

Secondly, price could correct from the horizontal  resistance zone , trade downwards, breaking the side-wards support line and into the previous horizontal  support zone  that the previous rally came off of, between 6280 and 6170. If price gets to this level, we want to see a quick, and sharp upside move. Any hanging around at this level after such recent upside would be suspicious and could be perceived as a total lack of interest. 

Finally, price could NOT CORRECT AT ALL. There is absolutely no reason why price has to correct now, it just seems logical for it to do so, but this is in no way obligatory. If price breaks the  resistance zone  before having had any corrections, then simply wait for a retest of the  resistance zone  turned new  support zone  and buy from there. Either way, everyones a winner. 

Feel free to leave a comment letting me know where you think price will go, I would be very interested to hear everyones thoughts. 

This idea will continue to be updated if the idea receives sufficient attention.

1530720921.0,GreenDillys,BTC Hourly update: Rising Wedge Forming,"
Over the last two days, we've seen rising price action from  BTC 2.40% , but that  bullish  sentiment looks about to fail us. A  rising wedge  forming on our hourly chart indicates an incoming breakout. This looks like an ideal setup for a short position, with a break downwards from the  wedge  expected at around 13:00 EST tomorrow afternoon. A breakout below the 6515  support level  would confirm this breakout. Entry is recommended on the retest of the 6650 level after having broken the  wedge , with a stop-loss placed at 6720. First target is 6415 with a second target at 6290. 

This is not financial advice.

But the truth is, I  BTCUSD 2.40%  NEEDED to Square up (Orange ZONE). 
I had a free fall on July 10 and never been Square up back! 
Since everybody is used to know that I crash on Monday's, I thought it would be a great idea to square it up & cut the leg of all those who Shorted ME ( BTCUSD 2.40% )! 
Since I'm currently on a  Bullish trend  (Green  parallel channel ) I'm going to mind Fu*#@ all of you as much as possible to fill up my pocket!

""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" quote by Arthur Conan Doyle from the Sherlock series.  

Let me start by discussing the boxed pattern. Believe you me, I dug into all timeframes trying to find the slightest reason to allow me to draw it as a 5 wave structure. But I can't; there is just now way to draw it other than a 3 wave structure. 

Now -  
We only have two possibilities to start:  
a) 3-3-3-3-3  leading diagonal  giving a  bullish  count 
b) 3-3-5 flat corrective pattern  
*obviously, a corrective pattern may unfold into combo waves, but there are only these two possibilities for the short term.  

Because of the daily dogi and the price action, along with major alts approaching critical levels and  RSI  breaching 65 ( bearish  reversal zone) on higher TFs, I am  bullish  biased.  

Unfortunately, my count of  leading diagonal  has been invalidated (more in update later). 
This leads me to believe we are in a 3-3-5 pattern whilst acknowledging all the  bullish  signals. 
A 3-3-5  ABC  count will give wave C an  ending diagonal  pattern. The diagonal's wave 3 will have  volume  bar confirmation as labelled.

Bitcoin's first moon trip is about to hit target (Fib 1.414).  Seeing price climb a measly 2.4% is so agonizing.  Alts are fairing much better this time around. I do not anticipate price to hold above the target. This rocket is done for... at least for now. The best is yet to come for  Bitcoin             . :)

1530718924.0,TomProTrader,BTC/USD - Further Buy Opportunity,"
After our recent successful trade in  Bitcoin             , we now need to reassess  Bitcoins              movements to best decide what to do next. If you remember from my last analysis, I expected a retest on support and a breakout move to the next  structure resistance  level. This trade went perfectly to plan and we was highly successful with this. Now that price is at the above horizontal  resistance zone , price is somewhat at a juncture. This is because not only is the uptrend slightly extended, but also because the target I chose was exactly where the 200 major moving average began to act as a resistance, which was also predicted in my previous analysis. For this reason, we must now be nimble before placing a long position in  Bitcoin              to avoid becoming part of a bull trap.  

Swiftly moving onto the grit of this analysis,  Bitcoin              is currently trading right at the horizontal  resistance zone , coinciding with the 200 major moving average resistance between 6930 and 6820. As it stands the  candlestick  looks strong showing there was a crisp  bullish  move to my target without much objection. What goes up must come down. Logic dictates that now price has hit the  resistance zone , it will need to catch it's breath again before a new pump. 

Price will now do one of 2 things before the next move.  

Firstly, price will correct from the horizontal  resistance zone  down to the side-wards support line, before bouncing off the line and using it as support, with a new upside move taking place. If this scenario happens, it shows the bigger buyers are still interested in pumping price and it is a safe bet, if, a little aggressive also. 

Secondly, price could correct from the horizontal  resistance zone , trade downwards, breaking the side-wards support line and into the previous horizontal  support zone  that the previous rally came off of, between 6280 and 6170. If price gets to this level, we want to see a quick, and sharp upside move. Any hanging around at this level after such recent upside would be suspicious and could be perceived as a total lack of interest. 

Finally, price could NOT CORRECT AT ALL. There is absolutely no reason why price has to correct now, it just seems logical for it to do so, but this is in no way obligatory. If price breaks the  resistance zone  before having had any corrections, then simply wait for a retest of the  resistance zone  turned new  support zone  and buy from there. Either way, everyones a winner. 

Feel free to leave a comment letting me know where you think price will go, I would be very interested to hear everyones thoughts.

1530720921.0,GreenDillys,BTC Hourly update: Rising Wedge Forming,"
Over the last two days, we've seen rising price action from  BTC 2.41% , but that  bullish  sentiment looks about to fail us. A  rising wedge  forming on our hourly chart indicates an incoming breakout. This looks like an ideal setup for a short position, with a break downwards from the  wedge  expected at around 13:00 EST tomorrow afternoon. A breakout below the 6515  support level  would confirm this breakout. Entry is recommended on the retest of the 6650 level after having broken the  wedge , with a stop-loss placed at 6720. First target is 6415 with a second target at 6290. 

This is not financial advice.

- The current Daily Candle is hitting the 30 and 10  EMA . (The circled area) 
- Give it another day or so to resolve but it'll be interesting to see where this goes.  
- The bulls will need some more  volume  and momentum since it's been 4-6 days of solid upwards price action.

1530720921.0,GreenDillys,BTC Hourly update: Rising Wedge Forming,"
Over the last two days, we've seen rising price action from  BTC 2.47% , but that  bullish  sentiment looks about to fail us. A  rising wedge  forming on our hourly chart indicates an incoming breakout. This looks like an ideal setup for a short position, with a break downwards from the  wedge  expected at around 13:00 EST tomorrow afternoon. A breakout below the 6515  support level  would confirm this breakout. Entry is recommended on the retest of the 6650 level after having broken the  wedge , with a stop-loss placed at 6720. First target is 6415 with a second target at 6290. 

This is not financial advice.

BULLISH  TRAP Some could say! 
Yes, maybe!  
But the truth is, I  BTCUSD 2.47%  NEEDED to Square up (Orange ZONE). 
I had a free fall on July 10 and never been Square up back! 
Since everybody is used to know that I crash on Monday's, I thought it would be a great idea to square it up & cut the leg of all those who Shorted ME ( BTCUSD 2.47% )! 
Since I'm currently on a  Bullish trend  (Green  parallel channel ) I'm going to mind Fu*#@ all of you as much as possible to fill up my pocket!

an hour ago




""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" quote by Arthur Conan Doyle from the Sherlock series.  

Let me start by discussing the boxed pattern. Believe you me, I dug into all timeframes trying to find the slightest reason to allow me to draw it as a 5 wave structure. But I can't; there is just now way to draw it other than a 3 wave structure. 

Now -  
We only have two possibilities to start:  
a) 3-3-3-3-3  leading diagonal  giving a  bullish  count 
b) 3-3-5 flat corrective pattern  
*obviously, a corrective pattern may unfold into combo waves, but there are only these two possibilities for the short term.  

Because of the daily dogi and the price action, along with major alts approaching critical levels and  RSI  breaching 65 ( bearish  reversal zone) on higher TFs, I am  bullish  biased.  

Unfortunately, my count of  leading diagonal  has been invalidated (more in update later). 
This leads me to believe we are in a 3-3-5 pattern whilst acknowledging all the  bullish  signals. 
A 3-3-5  ABC  count will give wave C an  ending diagonal  pattern. The diagonal's wave 3 will have  volume  bar confirmation as labelled. 

More updates later.

Bitcoin's first moon trip is about to hit target (Fib 1.414).  Seeing price climb a measly 2.4% is so agonizing.  Alts are fairing much better this time around. I do not anticipate price to hold above the target. This rocket is done for... at least for now. The best is yet to come for  Bitcoin             . :)

After our recent successful trade in  Bitcoin             , we now need to reassess  Bitcoins              movements to best decide what to do next. If you remember from my last analysis, I expected a retest on support and a breakout move to the next  structure resistance  level. This trade went perfectly to plan and we was highly successful with this. Now that price is at the above horizontal  resistance zone , price is somewhat at a juncture. This is because not only is the uptrend slightly extended, but also because the target I chose was exactly where the 200 major moving average began to act as a resistance, which was also predicted in my previous analysis. For this reason, we must now be nimble before placing a long position in  Bitcoin              to avoid becoming part of a bull trap.  

Swiftly moving onto the grit of this analysis,  Bitcoin              is currently trading right at the horizontal  resistance zone , coinciding with the 200 major moving average resistance between 6930 and 6820. As it stands the  candlestick  looks strong showing there was a crisp  bullish  move to my target without much objection. What goes up must come down. Logic dictates that now price has hit the  resistance zone , it will need to catch it's breath again before a new pump. 

Price will now do one of 2 things before the next move.  

Firstly, price will correct from the horizontal  resistance zone  down to the side-wards support line, before bouncing off the line and using it as support, with a new upside move taking place. If this scenario happens, it shows the bigger buyers are still interested in pumping price and it is a safe bet, if, a little aggressive also. 

Secondly, price could correct from the horizontal  resistance zone , trade downwards, breaking the side-wards support line and into the previous horizontal  support zone  that the previous rally came off of, between 6280 and 6170. If price gets to this level, we want to see a quick, and sharp upside move. Any hanging around at this level after such recent upside would be suspicious and could be perceived as a total lack of interest. 

Finally, price could NOT CORRECT AT ALL. There is absolutely no reason why price has to correct now, it just seems logical for it to do so, but this is in no way obligatory. If price breaks the  resistance zone  before having had any corrections, then simply wait for a retest of the  resistance zone  turned new  support zone  and buy from there. Either way, everyones a winner. 

Feel free to leave a comment letting me know where you think price will go, I would be very interested to hear everyones thoughts. 

This idea will continue to be updated if the idea receives sufficient attention.

Firstly, price will correct from the horizontal  resistance zone  down to the side-wards support line, before bouncing off the line and using it as support, with a new upside move taking place. If this scenario happens, it shows the bigger buyers are still interested in pumping price and it is a safe bet, if, a little aggressive also. 

Secondly, price could correct from the horizontal  resistance zone , trade downwards, breaking the side-wards support line and into the previous horizontal  support zone  that the previous rally came off of, between 6280 and 6170. If price gets to this level, we want to see a quick, and sharp upside move. Any hanging around at this level after such recent upside would be suspicious and could be perceived as a total lack of interest. 

Finally, price could NOT CORRECT AT ALL. There is absolutely no reason why price has to correct now, it just seems logical for it to do so, but this is in no way obligatory. If price breaks the  resistance zone  before having had any corrections, then simply wait for a retest of the  resistance zone  turned new  support zone  and buy from there. Either way, everyones a winner. 

Feel free to leave a comment letting me know where you think price will go, I would be very interested to hear everyones thoughts. 

This idea will continue to be updated if the idea receives sufficient attention.

Over the last two days, we've seen rising price action from  BTC 2.50% , but that  bullish  sentiment looks about to fail us. A  rising wedge  forming on our hourly chart indicates an incoming breakout. This looks like an ideal setup for a short position, with a break downwards from the  wedge  expected at around 13:00 EST tomorrow afternoon. A breakout below the 6515  support level  would confirm this breakout. Entry is recommended on the retest of the 6650 level after having broken the  wedge , with a stop-loss placed at 6720. First target is 6415 with a second target at 6290.

""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" quote by Arthur Conan Doyle from the Sherlock series.  

Let me start by discussing the boxed pattern. Believe you me, I dug into all timeframes trying to find the slightest reason to allow me to draw it as a 5 wave structure. But I can't; there is just now way to draw it other than a 3 wave structure. 

Now -  
We only have two possibilities to start:  
a) 3-3-3-3-3  leading diagonal  giving a  bullish  count 
b) 3-3-5 flat corrective pattern  
*obviously, a corrective pattern may unfold into combo waves, but there are only these two possibilities for the short term.  

Because of the daily dogi and the price action, along with major alts approaching critical levels and  RSI  breaching 65 ( bearish  reversal zone) on higher TFs, I am  bullish  biased.  

Unfortunately, my count of  leading diagonal  has been invalidated (more in update later). 
This leads me to believe we are in a 3-3-5 pattern whilst acknowledging all the  bullish  signals. 
A 3-3-5  ABC  count will give wave C an  ending diagonal  pattern. The diagonal's wave 3 will have  volume  bar confirmation as labelled.

I do not anticipate price to hold above the target. This rocket is done for... at least for now. The best is yet to come for  Bitcoin 2.48% . :)

After our recent successful trade in  Bitcoin 2.48% , we now need to reassess  Bitcoins 2.48%  movements to best decide what to do next. If you remember from my last analysis, I expected a retest on support and a breakout move to the next  structure resistance  level. This trade went perfectly to plan and we was highly successful with this. Now that price is at the above horizontal  resistance zone , price is somewhat at a juncture. This is because not only is the uptrend slightly extended, but also because the target I chose was exactly where the 200 major moving average began to act as a resistance, which was also predicted in my previous analysis. For this reason, we must now be nimble before placing a long position in  Bitcoin 2.48%  to avoid becoming part of a bull trap.  

Swiftly moving onto the grit of this analysis,  Bitcoin 2.48%  is currently trading right at the horizontal  resistance zone , coinciding with the 200 major moving average resistance between 6930 and 6820. As it stands the  candlestick  looks strong showing there was a crisp  bullish  move to my target without much objection. What goes up must come down. Logic dictates that now price has hit the  resistance zone , it will need to catch it's breath again before a new pump. 

Price will now do one of 2 things before the next move.  

Firstly, price will correct from the horizontal  resistance zone  down to the side-wards support line, before bouncing off the line and using it as support, with a new upside move taking place.

I have 3 targets setup for  Bitcoin 2.48%  in this bull season. They are stated in this chart below.

After our recent successful trade in  Bitcoin 2.48% , we now need to reassess  Bitcoins 2.48%  movements to best decide what to do next. If you remember from my last analysis, I expected a retest on support and a breakout move to the next  structure resistance  level. This trade went perfectly to plan and we was highly successful with this. Now that price is at the above horizontal  resistance zone , price is somewhat at a juncture. This is because not only is the uptrend slightly extended, but also because the target I chose was exactly where the 200 major moving average began to act as a resistance, which was also predicted in my previous analysis. For this reason, we must now be nimble before placing a long position in  Bitcoin 2.48%  to avoid becoming part of a bull trap.  

Swiftly moving onto the grit of this analysis,  Bitcoin 2.48%  is currently trading right at the horizontal  resistance zone , coinciding with the 200 major moving average resistance between 6930 and 6820. As it stands the  candlestick  looks strong showing there was a crisp  bullish  move to my target without much objection. What goes up must come down. Logic dictates that now price has hit the  resistance zone , it will need to catch it's breath again before a new pump. 

Price will now do one of 2 things before the next move.  

Firstly, price will correct from the horizontal  resistance zone  down to the side-wards support line, before bouncing off the line and using it as support, with a new upside move taking place. If this scenario happens, it shows the bigger buyers are still interested in pumping price and it is a safe bet, if, a little aggressive also. 

Secondly, price could correct from the horizontal  resistance zone , trade downwards, breaking the side-wards support line and into the previous horizontal  support zone  that the previous rally came off of, between 6280 and 6170. If price gets to this level, we want to see a quick, and sharp upside move. Any hanging around at this level after such recent upside would be suspicious and could be perceived as a total lack of interest. 

Finally, price could NOT CORRECT AT ALL. There is absolutely no reason why price has to correct now, it just seems logical for it to do so, but this is in no way obligatory. If price breaks the  resistance zone  before having had any corrections, then simply wait for a retest of the  resistance zone  turned new  support zone  and buy from there. Either way, everyones a winner. 

Feel free to leave a comment letting me know where you think price will go, I would be very interested to hear everyones thoughts. 

This idea will continue to be updated if the idea receives sufficient attention.

1530720921.0,GreenDillys,BTC Hourly update: Rising Wedge Forming,"
Over the last two days, we've seen rising price action from  BTC 2.48% , but that  bullish  sentiment looks about to fail us. A  rising wedge  forming on our hourly chart indicates an incoming breakout. This looks like an ideal setup for a short position, with a break downwards from the  wedge  expected at around 13:00 EST tomorrow afternoon. A breakout below the 6515  support level  would confirm this breakout. Entry is recommended on the retest of the 6650 level after having broken the  wedge , with a stop-loss placed at 6720. First target is 6415 with a second target at 6290. 

This is not financial advice.

I had a free fall on July 10 and never been Square up back! 
Since everybody is used to know that I crash on Monday's, I thought it would be a great idea to square it up & cut the leg of all those who Shorted ME ( BTCUSD 2.48% )!

""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" quote by Arthur Conan Doyle from the Sherlock series.  

Let me start by discussing the boxed pattern. Believe you me, I dug into all timeframes trying to find the slightest reason to allow me to draw it as a 5 wave structure. But I can't; there is just now way to draw it other than a 3 wave structure. 

Now -  
We only have two possibilities to start:  
a) 3-3-3-3-3  leading diagonal  giving a  bullish  count 
b) 3-3-5 flat corrective pattern  
*obviously, a corrective pattern may unfold into combo waves, but there are only these two possibilities for the short term.  

Because of the daily dogi and the price action, along with major alts approaching critical levels and  RSI  breaching 65 ( bearish  reversal zone) on higher TFs, I am  bullish  biased.  

Unfortunately, my count of  leading diagonal  has been invalidated (more in update later). 
This leads me to believe we are in a 3-3-5 pattern whilst acknowledging all the  bullish  signals. 
A 3-3-5  ABC  count will give wave C an  ending diagonal  pattern. The diagonal's wave 3 will have  volume  bar confirmation as labelled. 

More updates later.

If you don't think it'll go down that far, check out the chart i posted before this one. It has higher entry targets.

*obviously, a corrective pattern may unfold into combo waves, but there are only these two possibilities for the short term.  

Because of the daily dogi and the price action, along with major alts approaching critical levels and  RSI  breaching 65 ( bearish  reversal zone) on higher TFs, I am  bullish  biased.  

Unfortunately, my count of  leading diagonal  has been invalidated (more in update later). 
This leads me to believe we are in a 3-3-5 pattern whilst acknowledging all the  bullish  signals.

I'm thinking a  double top  into a plummet down to 6135-6133 (making a sweet  inverse head and shoulders ) 

If you don't think it'll go down that far, check out the chart i posted before this one. It has higher entry targets.

Bitcoin's first moon trip is about to hit target (Fib 1.414).  Seeing price climb a measly 2.4% is so agonizing.  Alts are fairing much better this time around. I do not anticipate price to hold above the target. This rocket is done for... at least for now. The best is yet to come for  Bitcoin             . :)

After our recent successful trade in  Bitcoin             , we now need to reassess  Bitcoins              movements to best decide what to do next. If you remember from my last analysis, I expected a retest on support and a breakout move to the next  structure resistance  level. This trade went perfectly to plan and we was highly successful with this. Now that price is at the above horizontal  resistance zone , price is somewhat at a juncture. This is because not only is the uptrend slightly extended, but also because the target I chose was exactly where the 200 major moving average began to act as a resistance, which was also predicted in my previous analysis. For this reason, we must now be nimble before placing a long position in  Bitcoin              to avoid becoming part of a bull trap.  

Swiftly moving onto the grit of this analysis,  Bitcoin              is currently trading right at the horizontal  resistance zone , coinciding with the 200 major moving average resistance between 6930 and 6820. As it stands the  candlestick  looks strong showing there was a crisp  bullish  move to my target without much objection. What goes up must come down. Logic dictates that now price has hit the  resistance zone , it will need to catch it's breath again before a new pump. 

Price will now do one of 2 things before the next move.  

Firstly, price will correct from the horizontal  resistance zone  down to the side-wards support line, before bouncing off the line and using it as support, with a new upside move taking place. If this scenario happens, it shows the bigger buyers are still interested in pumping price and it is a safe bet, if, a little aggressive also. 

Secondly, price could correct from the horizontal  resistance zone , trade downwards, breaking the side-wards support line and into the previous horizontal  support zone  that the previous rally came off of, between 6280 and 6170. If price gets to this level, we want to see a quick, and sharp upside move. Any hanging around at this level after such recent upside would be suspicious and could be perceived as a total lack of interest. 

Finally, price could NOT CORRECT AT ALL. There is absolutely no reason why price has to correct now, it just seems logical for it to do so, but this is in no way obligatory. If price breaks the  resistance zone  before having had any corrections, then simply wait for a retest of the  resistance zone  turned new  support zone  and buy from there. Either way, everyones a winner. 

Feel free to leave a comment letting me know where you think price will go, I would be very interested to hear everyones thoughts. 

This idea will continue to be updated if the idea receives sufficient attention.

Over the last two days, we've seen rising price action from  BTC             , but that  bullish  sentiment looks about to fail us. A  rising wedge  forming on our hourly chart indicates an incoming breakout. This looks like an ideal setup for a short position, with a break downwards from the  wedge  expected at around 13:00 EST tomorrow afternoon. A breakout below the 6515  support level  would confirm this breakout. Entry is recommended on the retest of the 6650 level after having broken the  wedge , with a stop-loss placed at 6720. First target is 6415 with a second target at 6290.

""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" quote by Arthur Conan Doyle from the Sherlock series.  

Let me start by discussing the boxed pattern. Believe you me, I dug into all timeframes trying to find the slightest reason to allow me to draw it as a 5 wave structure. But I can't; there is just now way to draw it other than a 3 wave structure. 

Now -  
We only have two possibilities to start:  
a) 3-3-3-3-3  leading diagonal  giving a  bullish  count 
b) 3-3-5 flat corrective pattern  
*obviously, a corrective pattern may unfold into combo waves, but there are only these two possibilities for the short term.  

Because of the daily dogi and the price action, along with major alts approaching critical levels and  RSI  breaching 65 ( bearish  reversal zone) on higher TFs, I am  bullish  biased.  

Unfortunately, my count of  leading diagonal  has been invalidated (more in update later). 
This leads me to believe we are in a 3-3-5 pattern whilst acknowledging all the  bullish  signals. 
A 3-3-5  ABC  count will give wave C an  ending diagonal  pattern. The diagonal's wave 3 will have  volume  bar confirmation as labelled.

After our recent successful trade in  Bitcoin 2.59% , we now need to reassess  Bitcoins 2.59%  movements to best decide what to do next. If you remember from my last analysis, I expected a retest on support and a breakout move to the next  structure resistance  level. This trade went perfectly to plan and we was highly successful with this. Now that price is at the above horizontal  resistance zone , price is somewhat at a juncture. This is because not only is the uptrend slightly extended, but also because the target I chose was exactly where the 200 major moving average began to act as a resistance, which was also predicted in my previous analysis. For this reason, we must now be nimble before placing a long position in  Bitcoin 2.59%  to avoid becoming part of a bull trap.  

Swiftly moving onto the grit of this analysis,  Bitcoin 2.59%  is currently trading right at the horizontal  resistance zone , coinciding with the 200 major moving average resistance between 6930 and 6820. As it stands the  candlestick  looks strong showing there was a crisp  bullish  move to my target without much objection. What goes up must come down. Logic dictates that now price has hit the  resistance zone , it will need to catch it's breath again before a new pump. 

Price will now do one of 2 things before the next move.  

Firstly, price will correct from the horizontal  resistance zone  down to the side-wards support line, before bouncing off the line and using it as support, with a new upside move taking place. If this scenario happens, it shows the bigger buyers are still interested in pumping price and it is a safe bet, if, a little aggressive also. 

Secondly, price could correct from the horizontal  resistance zone , trade downwards, breaking the side-wards support line and into the previous horizontal  support zone  that the previous rally came off of, between 6280 and 6170. If price gets to this level, we want to see a quick, and sharp upside move. Any hanging around at this level after such recent upside would be suspicious and could be perceived as a total lack of interest. 

Finally, price could NOT CORRECT AT ALL. There is absolutely no reason why price has to correct now, it just seems logical for it to do so, but this is in no way obligatory. If price breaks the  resistance zone  before having had any corrections, then simply wait for a retest of the  resistance zone  turned new  support zone  and buy from there. Either way, everyones a winner. 

Feel free to leave a comment letting me know where you think price will go, I would be very interested to hear everyones thoughts. 

This idea will continue to be updated if the idea receives sufficient attention.

Over the last two days, we've seen rising price action from  BTC 2.59% , but that  bullish  sentiment looks about to fail us. A  rising wedge  forming on our hourly chart indicates an incoming breakout. This looks like an ideal setup for a short position, with a break downwards from the  wedge  expected at around 13:00 EST tomorrow afternoon. A breakout below the 6515  support level  would confirm this breakout. Entry is recommended on the retest of the 6650 level after having broken the  wedge , with a stop-loss placed at 6720. First target is 6415 with a second target at 6290.

""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" quote by Arthur Conan Doyle from the Sherlock series.  

Let me start by discussing the boxed pattern. Believe you me, I dug into all timeframes trying to find the slightest reason to allow me to draw it as a 5 wave structure. But I can't; there is just now way to draw it other than a 3 wave structure. 

Now -  
We only have two possibilities to start:  
a) 3-3-3-3-3  leading diagonal  giving a  bullish  count 
b) 3-3-5 flat corrective pattern  
*obviously, a corrective pattern may unfold into combo waves, but there are only these two possibilities for the short term.  

Because of the daily dogi and the price action, along with major alts approaching critical levels and  RSI  breaching 65 ( bearish  reversal zone) on higher TFs, I am  bullish  biased.  

Unfortunately, my count of  leading diagonal  has been invalidated (more in update later). 
This leads me to believe we are in a 3-3-5 pattern whilst acknowledging all the  bullish  signals. 
A 3-3-5  ABC  count will give wave C an  ending diagonal  pattern. The diagonal's wave 3 will have  volume  bar confirmation as labelled. 

More updates later.

Bitcoin's first moon trip is about to hit target (Fib 1.414).  Seeing price climb a measly 2.4% is so agonizing.  Alts are fairing much better this time around. I do not anticipate price to hold above the target. This rocket is done for... at least for now. The best is yet to come for  Bitcoin             . :)

1530718924.0,TomProTrader,BTC/USD - Further Buy Opportunity,"
After our recent successful trade in  Bitcoin             , we now need to reassess  Bitcoins              movements to best decide what to do next. If you remember from my last analysis, I expected a retest on support and a breakout move to the next  structure resistance  level. This trade went perfectly to plan and we was highly successful with this. Now that price is at the above horizontal  resistance zone , price is somewhat at a juncture. This is because not only is the uptrend slightly extended, but also because the target I chose was exactly where the 200 major moving average began to act as a resistance, which was also predicted in my previous analysis. For this reason, we must now be nimble before placing a long position in  Bitcoin              to avoid becoming part of a bull trap.  

Swiftly moving onto the grit of this analysis,  Bitcoin              is currently trading right at the horizontal  resistance zone , coinciding with the 200 major moving average resistance between 6930 and 6820. As it stands the  candlestick  looks strong showing there was a crisp  bullish  move to my target without much objection. What goes up must come down. Logic dictates that now price has hit the  resistance zone , it will need to catch it's breath again before a new pump. 

Price will now do one of 2 things before the next move.  

Firstly, price will correct from the horizontal  resistance zone  down to the side-wards support line, before bouncing off the line and using it as support, with a new upside move taking place. If this scenario happens, it shows the bigger buyers are still interested in pumping price and it is a safe bet, if, a little aggressive also. 

Secondly, price could correct from the horizontal  resistance zone , trade downwards, breaking the side-wards support line and into the previous horizontal  support zone  that the previous rally came off of, between 6280 and 6170. If price gets to this level, we want to see a quick, and sharp upside move. Any hanging around at this level after such recent upside would be suspicious and could be perceived as a total lack of interest. 

Finally, price could NOT CORRECT AT ALL. There is absolutely no reason why price has to correct now, it just seems logical for it to do so, but this is in no way obligatory. If price breaks the  resistance zone  before having had any corrections, then simply wait for a retest of the  resistance zone  turned new  support zone  and buy from there. Either way, everyones a winner. 

Feel free to leave a comment letting me know where you think price will go, I would be very interested to hear everyones thoughts. 

This idea will continue to be updated if the idea receives sufficient attention.

1530720921.0,GreenDillys,BTC Hourly update: Rising Wedge Forming,"
Over the last two days, we've seen rising price action from  BTC 2.57% , but that  bullish  sentiment looks about to fail us. A  rising wedge  forming on our hourly chart indicates an incoming breakout. This looks like an ideal setup for a short position, with a break downwards from the  wedge  expected at around 13:00 EST tomorrow afternoon. A breakout below the 6515  support level  would confirm this breakout. Entry is recommended on the retest of the 6650 level after having broken the  wedge , with a stop-loss placed at 6720. First target is 6415 with a second target at 6290. 

This is not financial advice.

1530720921.0,GreenDillys,BTC Hourly update: Rising Wedge Forming,"
Over the last two days, we've seen rising price action from  BTC 2.63% , but that  bullish  sentiment looks about to fail us. A  rising wedge  forming on our hourly chart indicates an incoming breakout. This looks like an ideal setup for a short position, with a break downwards from the  wedge  expected at around 13:00 EST tomorrow afternoon. A breakout below the 6515  support level  would confirm this breakout. Entry is recommended on the retest of the 6650 level after having broken the  wedge , with a stop-loss placed at 6720. First target is 6415 with a second target at 6290. 

This is not financial advice.

I had a free fall on July 10 and never been Square up back! 
Since everybody is used to know that I crash on Monday's, I thought it would be a great idea to square it up & cut the leg of all those who Shorted ME ( BTCUSD             )!

""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" quote by Arthur Conan Doyle from the Sherlock series.  

Let me start by discussing the boxed pattern. Believe you me, I dug into all timeframes trying to find the slightest reason to allow me to draw it as a 5 wave structure. But I can't; there is just now way to draw it other than a 3 wave structure. 

Now -  
We only have two possibilities to start:  
a) 3-3-3-3-3  leading diagonal  giving a  bullish  count 
b) 3-3-5 flat corrective pattern  
*obviously, a corrective pattern may unfold into combo waves, but there are only these two possibilities for the short term.  

Because of the daily dogi and the price action, along with major alts approaching critical levels and  RSI  breaching 65 ( bearish  reversal zone) on higher TFs, I am  bullish  biased.  

Unfortunately, my count of  leading diagonal  has been invalidated (more in update later). 
This leads me to believe we are in a 3-3-5 pattern whilst acknowledging all the  bullish  signals. 
A 3-3-5  ABC  count will give wave C an  ending diagonal  pattern. The diagonal's wave 3 will have  volume  bar confirmation as labelled.

1530718924.0,TomProTrader,BTC/USD - Further Buy Opportunity,"
After our recent successful trade in  Bitcoin             , we now need to reassess  Bitcoins              movements to best decide what to do next. If you remember from my last analysis, I expected a retest on support and a breakout move to the next  structure resistance  level. This trade went perfectly to plan and we was highly successful with this. Now that price is at the above horizontal  resistance zone , price is somewhat at a juncture. This is because not only is the uptrend slightly extended, but also because the target I chose was exactly where the 200 major moving average began to act as a resistance, which was also predicted in my previous analysis. For this reason, we must now be nimble before placing a long position in  Bitcoin              to avoid becoming part of a bull trap.  

Swiftly moving onto the grit of this analysis,  Bitcoin              is currently trading right at the horizontal  resistance zone , coinciding with the 200 major moving average resistance between 6930 and 6820. As it stands the  candlestick  looks strong showing there was a crisp  bullish  move to my target without much objection. What goes up must come down. Logic dictates that now price has hit the  resistance zone , it will need to catch it's breath again before a new pump. 

Price will now do one of 2 things before the next move.  

Firstly, price will correct from the horizontal  resistance zone  down to the side-wards support line, before bouncing off the line and using it as support, with a new upside move taking place. If this scenario happens, it shows the bigger buyers are still interested in pumping price and it is a safe bet, if, a little aggressive also. 

Secondly, price could correct from the horizontal  resistance zone , trade downwards, breaking the side-wards support line and into the previous horizontal  support zone  that the previous rally came off of, between 6280 and 6170. If price gets to this level, we want to see a quick, and sharp upside move. Any hanging around at this level after such recent upside would be suspicious and could be perceived as a total lack of interest. 

Finally, price could NOT CORRECT AT ALL. There is absolutely no reason why price has to correct now, it just seems logical for it to do so, but this is in no way obligatory. If price breaks the  resistance zone  before having had any corrections, then simply wait for a retest of the  resistance zone  turned new  support zone  and buy from there. Either way, everyones a winner. 

Feel free to leave a comment letting me know where you think price will go, I would be very interested to hear everyones thoughts.

This trade went perfectly to plan and we was highly successful with this. Now that price is at the above horizontal  resistance zone , price is somewhat at a juncture. This is because not only is the uptrend slightly extended, but also because the target I chose was exactly where the 200 major moving average began to act as a resistance, which was also predicted in my previous analysis. For this reason, we must now be nimble before placing a long position in  Bitcoin 2.61%  to avoid becoming part of a bull trap.  

Swiftly moving onto the grit of this analysis,  Bitcoin 2.61%  is currently trading right at the horizontal  resistance zone , coinciding with the 200 major moving average resistance between 6930 and 6820. As it stands the  candlestick  looks strong showing there was a crisp  bullish  move to my target without much objection. What goes up must come down. Logic dictates that now price has hit the  resistance zone , it will need to catch it's breath again before a new pump. 

Price will now do one of 2 things before the next move.  

Firstly, price will correct from the horizontal  resistance zone  down to the side-wards support line, before bouncing off the line and using it as support, with a new upside move taking place. If this scenario happens, it shows the bigger buyers are still interested in pumping price and it is a safe bet, if, a little aggressive also. 

Secondly, price could correct from the horizontal  resistance zone , trade downwards, breaking the side-wards support line and into the previous horizontal  support zone  that the previous rally came off of, between 6280 and 6170. If price gets to this level, we want to see a quick, and sharp upside move. Any hanging around at this level after such recent upside would be suspicious and could be perceived as a total lack of interest. 

Finally, price could NOT CORRECT AT ALL. There is absolutely no reason why price has to correct now, it just seems logical for it to do so, but this is in no way obligatory. If price breaks the  resistance zone  before having had any corrections, then simply wait for a retest of the  resistance zone  turned new  support zone  and buy from there. Either way, everyones a winner. 

Feel free to leave a comment letting me know where you think price will go, I would be very interested to hear everyones thoughts. 

This idea will continue to be updated if the idea receives sufficient attention.

1530720921.0,GreenDillys,BTC Hourly update: Rising Wedge Forming,"
Over the last two days, we've seen rising price action from  BTC 2.61% , but that  bullish  sentiment looks about to fail us. A  rising wedge  forming on our hourly chart indicates an incoming breakout. This looks like an ideal setup for a short position, with a break downwards from the  wedge  expected at around 13:00 EST tomorrow afternoon. A breakout below the 6515  support level  would confirm this breakout. Entry is recommended on the retest of the 6650 level after having broken the  wedge , with a stop-loss placed at 6720. First target is 6415 with a second target at 6290. 

This is not financial advice.

""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" quote by Arthur Conan Doyle from the Sherlock series.  

Let me start by discussing the boxed pattern. Believe you me, I dug into all timeframes trying to find the slightest reason to allow me to draw it as a 5 wave structure. But I can't; there is just now way to draw it other than a 3 wave structure. 

Now -  
We only have two possibilities to start:  
a) 3-3-3-3-3  leading diagonal  giving a  bullish  count 
b) 3-3-5 flat corrective pattern  
*obviously, a corrective pattern may unfold into combo waves, but there are only these two possibilities for the short term.  

Because of the daily dogi and the price action, along with major alts approaching critical levels and  RSI  breaching 65 ( bearish  reversal zone) on higher TFs, I am  bullish  biased.  

Unfortunately, my count of  leading diagonal  has been invalidated (more in update later). 
This leads me to believe we are in a 3-3-5 pattern whilst acknowledging all the  bullish  signals. 
A 3-3-5  ABC  count will give wave C an  ending diagonal  pattern. The diagonal's wave 3 will have  volume  bar confirmation as labelled. 

More updates later.

Bitcoin's first moon trip is about to hit target (Fib 1.414).  Seeing price climb a measly 2.4% is so agonizing.  Alts are fairing much better this time around. I do not anticipate price to hold above the target. This rocket is done for... at least for now. The best is yet to come for  Bitcoin 2.61% . :)

I'm thinking a  double top  into a plummet down to 6135-6133 (making a sweet  inverse head and shoulders ) 

If you don't think it'll go down that far, check out the chart i posted before this one. It has higher entry targets. 





overrall though,  bullish  as all heck.

					Personally, i'm in a long from 6500. I'm going to be waiting to see what happens once we test that top again. If it luls and shows signs of reversing i'm swapping to a short.

Bitcoin's first moon trip is about to hit target (Fib 1.414).  Seeing price climb a measly 2.4% is so agonizing.  Alts are fairing much better this time around. I do not anticipate price to hold above the target. This rocket is done for... at least for now. The best is yet to come for  Bitcoin 2.61% . :) 

I have 3 targets setup for  Bitcoin 2.61%  in this bull season. They are stated in this chart below.

After our recent successful trade in  Bitcoin 2.61% , we now need to reassess  Bitcoins 2.61%  movements to best decide what to do next. If you remember from my last analysis, I expected a retest on support and a breakout move to the next  structure resistance  level. This trade went perfectly to plan and we was highly successful with this. Now that price is at the above horizontal  resistance zone , price is somewhat at a juncture. This is because not only is the uptrend slightly extended, but also because the target I chose was exactly where the 200 major moving average began to act as a resistance, which was also predicted in my previous analysis. For this reason, we must now be nimble before placing a long position in  Bitcoin 2.61%  to avoid becoming part of a bull trap.  

Swiftly moving onto the grit of this analysis,  Bitcoin 2.61%  is currently trading right at the horizontal  resistance zone , coinciding with the 200 major moving average resistance between 6930 and 6820. As it stands the  candlestick  looks strong showing there was a crisp  bullish  move to my target without much objection. What goes up must come down. Logic dictates that now price has hit the  resistance zone , it will need to catch it's breath again before a new pump. 

Price will now do one of 2 things before the next move.  

Firstly, price will correct from the horizontal  resistance zone  down to the side-wards support line, before bouncing off the line and using it as support, with a new upside move taking place. If this scenario happens, it shows the bigger buyers are still interested in pumping price and it is a safe bet, if, a little aggressive also. 

Secondly, price could correct from the horizontal  resistance zone , trade downwards, breaking the side-wards support line and into the previous horizontal  support zone  that the previous rally came off of, between 6280 and 6170. If price gets to this level, we want to see a quick, and sharp upside move. Any hanging around at this level after such recent upside would be suspicious and could be perceived as a total lack of interest. 

Finally, price could NOT CORRECT AT ALL. There is absolutely no reason why price has to correct now, it just seems logical for it to do so, but this is in no way obligatory. If price breaks the  resistance zone  before having had any corrections, then simply wait for a retest of the  resistance zone  turned new  support zone  and buy from there. Either way, everyones a winner. 

Feel free to leave a comment letting me know where you think price will go, I would be very interested to hear everyones thoughts. 

This idea will continue to be updated if the idea receives sufficient attention.

1530720921.0,GreenDillys,BTC Hourly update: Rising Wedge Forming,"
Over the last two days, we've seen rising price action from  BTC 2.61% , but that  bullish  sentiment looks about to fail us. A  rising wedge  forming on our hourly chart indicates an incoming breakout. This looks like an ideal setup for a short position, with a break downwards from the  wedge  expected at around 13:00 EST tomorrow afternoon. A breakout below the 6515  support level  would confirm this breakout. Entry is recommended on the retest of the 6650 level after having broken the  wedge , with a stop-loss placed at 6720. First target is 6415 with a second target at 6290. 

This is not financial advice.

Since everybody is used to know that I crash on Monday's, I thought it would be a great idea to square it up & cut the leg of all those who Shorted ME ( BTCUSD 2.61% )!

""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" quote by Arthur Conan Doyle from the Sherlock series.  

Let me start by discussing the boxed pattern. Believe you me, I dug into all timeframes trying to find the slightest reason to allow me to draw it as a 5 wave structure. But I can't; there is just now way to draw it other than a 3 wave structure. 

Now -  
We only have two possibilities to start:  
a) 3-3-3-3-3  leading diagonal  giving a  bullish  count 
b) 3-3-5 flat corrective pattern  
*obviously, a corrective pattern may unfold into combo waves, but there are only these two possibilities for the short term.  

Because of the daily dogi and the price action, along with major alts approaching critical levels and  RSI  breaching 65 ( bearish  reversal zone) on higher TFs, I am  bullish  biased.  

Unfortunately, my count of  leading diagonal  has been invalidated (more in update later). 
This leads me to believe we are in a 3-3-5 pattern whilst acknowledging all the  bullish  signals. 
A 3-3-5  ABC  count will give wave C an  ending diagonal  pattern. The diagonal's wave 3 will have  volume  bar confirmation as labelled. 

More updates later.

""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" quote by Arthur Conan Doyle from the Sherlock series.  

Let me start by discussing the boxed pattern. Believe you me, I dug into all timeframes trying to find the slightest reason to allow me to draw it as a 5 wave structure. But I can't; there is just now way to draw it other than a 3 wave structure. 

Now -  
We only have two possibilities to start:  
a) 3-3-3-3-3  leading diagonal  giving a  bullish  count 
b) 3-3-5 flat corrective pattern  
*obviously, a corrective pattern may unfold into combo waves, but there are only these two possibilities for the short term.  

Because of the daily dogi and the price action, along with major alts approaching critical levels and  RSI  breaching 65 ( bearish  reversal zone) on higher TFs, I am  bullish  biased.  

Unfortunately, my count of  leading diagonal  has been invalidated (more in update later). 
This leads me to believe we are in a 3-3-5 pattern whilst acknowledging all the  bullish  signals. 
A 3-3-5  ABC  count will give wave C an  ending diagonal  pattern. The diagonal's wave 3 will have  volume  bar confirmation as labelled.

After our recent successful trade in  Bitcoin 2.60% , we now need to reassess  Bitcoins 2.60%  movements to best decide what to do next. If you remember from my last analysis, I expected a retest on support and a breakout move to the next  structure resistance  level. This trade went perfectly to plan and we was highly successful with this. Now that price is at the above horizontal  resistance zone , price is somewhat at a juncture. This is because not only is the uptrend slightly extended, but also because the target I chose was exactly where the 200 major moving average began to act as a resistance, which was also predicted in my previous analysis. For this reason, we must now be nimble before placing a long position in  Bitcoin 2.60%  to avoid becoming part of a bull trap.  

Swiftly moving onto the grit of this analysis,  Bitcoin 2.60%  is currently trading right at the horizontal  resistance zone , coinciding with the 200 major moving average resistance between 6930 and 6820. As it stands the  candlestick  looks strong showing there was a crisp  bullish  move to my target without much objection. What goes up must come down. Logic dictates that now price has hit the  resistance zone , it will need to catch it's breath again before a new pump. 

Price will now do one of 2 things before the next move.  

Firstly, price will correct from the horizontal  resistance zone  down to the side-wards support line, before bouncing off the line and using it as support, with a new upside move taking place. If this scenario happens, it shows the bigger buyers are still interested in pumping price and it is a safe bet, if, a little aggressive also. 

Secondly, price could correct from the horizontal  resistance zone , trade downwards, breaking the side-wards support line and into the previous horizontal  support zone  that the previous rally came off of, between 6280 and 6170. If price gets to this level, we want to see a quick, and sharp upside move. Any hanging around at this level after such recent upside would be suspicious and could be perceived as a total lack of interest. 

Finally, price could NOT CORRECT AT ALL. There is absolutely no reason why price has to correct now, it just seems logical for it to do so, but this is in no way obligatory. If price breaks the  resistance zone  before having had any corrections, then simply wait for a retest of the  resistance zone  turned new  support zone  and buy from there. Either way, everyones a winner. 

Feel free to leave a comment letting me know where you think price will go, I would be very interested to hear everyones thoughts.

1530720921.0,GreenDillys,BTC Hourly update: Rising Wedge Forming,"
Over the last two days, we've seen rising price action from  BTC 2.60% , but that  bullish  sentiment looks about to fail us. A  rising wedge  forming on our hourly chart indicates an incoming breakout. This looks like an ideal setup for a short position, with a break downwards from the  wedge  expected at around 13:00 EST tomorrow afternoon. A breakout below the 6515  support level  would confirm this breakout. Entry is recommended on the retest of the 6650 level after having broken the  wedge , with a stop-loss placed at 6720. First target is 6415 with a second target at 6290. 

This is not financial advice.

""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" quote by Arthur Conan Doyle from the Sherlock series.  

Let me start by discussing the boxed pattern. Believe you me, I dug into all timeframes trying to find the slightest reason to allow me to draw it as a 5 wave structure. But I can't; there is just now way to draw it other than a 3 wave structure. 

Now -  
We only have two possibilities to start:  
a) 3-3-3-3-3  leading diagonal  giving a  bullish  count 
b) 3-3-5 flat corrective pattern  
*obviously, a corrective pattern may unfold into combo waves, but there are only these two possibilities for the short term.  

Because of the daily dogi and the price action, along with major alts approaching critical levels and  RSI  breaching 65 ( bearish  reversal zone) on higher TFs, I am  bullish  biased.  

Unfortunately, my count of  leading diagonal  has been invalidated (more in update later). 
This leads me to believe we are in a 3-3-5 pattern whilst acknowledging all the  bullish  signals. 
A 3-3-5  ABC  count will give wave C an  ending diagonal  pattern. The diagonal's wave 3 will have  volume  bar confirmation as labelled.

1530718924.0,TomProTrader,BTC/USD - Further Buy Opportunity,"
After our recent successful trade in  Bitcoin 2.61% , we now need to reassess  Bitcoins 2.61%  movements to best decide what to do next. If you remember from my last analysis, I expected a retest on support and a breakout move to the next  structure resistance  level. This trade went perfectly to plan and we was highly successful with this. Now that price is at the above horizontal  resistance zone , price is somewhat at a juncture. This is because not only is the uptrend slightly extended, but also because the target I chose was exactly where the 200 major moving average began to act as a resistance, which was also predicted in my previous analysis. For this reason, we must now be nimble before placing a long position in  Bitcoin 2.61%  to avoid becoming part of a bull trap.  

Swiftly moving onto the grit of this analysis,  Bitcoin 2.61%  is currently trading right at the horizontal  resistance zone , coinciding with the 200 major moving average resistance between 6930 and 6820. As it stands the  candlestick  looks strong showing there was a crisp  bullish  move to my target without much objection. What goes up must come down. Logic dictates that now price has hit the  resistance zone , it will need to catch it's breath again before a new pump. 

Price will now do one of 2 things before the next move.  

Firstly, price will correct from the horizontal  resistance zone  down to the side-wards support line, before bouncing off the line and using it as support, with a new upside move taking place. If this scenario happens, it shows the bigger buyers are still interested in pumping price and it is a safe bet, if, a little aggressive also. 

Secondly, price could correct from the horizontal  resistance zone , trade downwards, breaking the side-wards support line and into the previous horizontal  support zone  that the previous rally came off of, between 6280 and 6170. If price gets to this level, we want to see a quick, and sharp upside move. Any hanging around at this level after such recent upside would be suspicious and could be perceived as a total lack of interest. 

Finally, price could NOT CORRECT AT ALL. There is absolutely no reason why price has to correct now, it just seems logical for it to do so, but this is in no way obligatory. If price breaks the  resistance zone  before having had any corrections, then simply wait for a retest of the  resistance zone  turned new  support zone  and buy from there. Either way, everyones a winner. 

Feel free to leave a comment letting me know where you think price will go, I would be very interested to hear everyones thoughts.

1530720921.0,GreenDillys,BTC Hourly update: Rising Wedge Forming,"
Over the last two days, we've seen rising price action from  BTC 2.61% , but that  bullish  sentiment looks about to fail us. A  rising wedge  forming on our hourly chart indicates an incoming breakout. This looks like an ideal setup for a short position, with a break downwards from the  wedge  expected at around 13:00 EST tomorrow afternoon. A breakout below the 6515  support level  would confirm this breakout. Entry is recommended on the retest of the 6650 level after having broken the  wedge , with a stop-loss placed at 6720. First target is 6415 with a second target at 6290. 

This is not financial advice.

1530720921.0,GreenDillys,BTC Hourly update: Rising Wedge Forming,"
Over the last two days, we've seen rising price action from  BTC 2.60% , but that  bullish  sentiment looks about to fail us. A  rising wedge  forming on our hourly chart indicates an incoming breakout. This looks like an ideal setup for a short position, with a break downwards from the  wedge  expected at around 13:00 EST tomorrow afternoon. A breakout below the 6515  support level  would confirm this breakout. Entry is recommended on the retest of the 6650 level after having broken the  wedge , with a stop-loss placed at 6720. First target is 6415 with a second target at 6290. 

This is not financial advice.

I had a free fall on July 10 and never been Square up back! 
Since everybody is used to know that I crash on Monday's, I thought it would be a great idea to square it up & cut the leg of all those who Shorted ME ( BTCUSD 2.60% )!

""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" quote by Arthur Conan Doyle from the Sherlock series.  

Let me start by discussing the boxed pattern. Believe you me, I dug into all timeframes trying to find the slightest reason to allow me to draw it as a 5 wave structure. But I can't; there is just now way to draw it other than a 3 wave structure. 

Now -  
We only have two possibilities to start:  
a) 3-3-3-3-3  leading diagonal  giving a  bullish  count 
b) 3-3-5 flat corrective pattern  
*obviously, a corrective pattern may unfold into combo waves, but there are only these two possibilities for the short term.  

Because of the daily dogi and the price action, along with major alts approaching critical levels and  RSI  breaching 65 ( bearish  reversal zone) on higher TFs, I am  bullish  biased.  

Unfortunately, my count of  leading diagonal  has been invalidated (more in update later). 
This leads me to believe we are in a 3-3-5 pattern whilst acknowledging all the  bullish  signals. 
A 3-3-5  ABC  count will give wave C an  ending diagonal  pattern. The diagonal's wave 3 will have  volume  bar confirmation as labelled.

After our recent successful trade in  Bitcoin             , we now need to reassess  Bitcoins              movements to best decide what to do next. If you remember from my last analysis, I expected a retest on support and a breakout move to the next  structure resistance  level. This trade went perfectly to plan and we was highly successful with this. Now that price is at the above horizontal  resistance zone , price is somewhat at a juncture. This is because not only is the uptrend slightly extended, but also because the target I chose was exactly where the 200 major moving average began to act as a resistance, which was also predicted in my previous analysis. For this reason, we must now be nimble before placing a long position in  Bitcoin              to avoid becoming part of a bull trap.  

Swiftly moving onto the grit of this analysis,  Bitcoin              is currently trading right at the horizontal  resistance zone , coinciding with the 200 major moving average resistance between 6930 and 6820. As it stands the  candlestick  looks strong showing there was a crisp  bullish  move to my target without much objection. What goes up must come down. Logic dictates that now price has hit the  resistance zone , it will need to catch it's breath again before a new pump. 

Price will now do one of 2 things before the next move.  

Firstly, price will correct from the horizontal  resistance zone  down to the side-wards support line, before bouncing off the line and using it as support, with a new upside move taking place. If this scenario happens, it shows the bigger buyers are still interested in pumping price and it is a safe bet, if, a little aggressive also. 

Secondly, price could correct from the horizontal  resistance zone , trade downwards, breaking the side-wards support line and into the previous horizontal  support zone  that the previous rally came off of, between 6280 and 6170. If price gets to this level, we want to see a quick, and sharp upside move. Any hanging around at this level after such recent upside would be suspicious and could be perceived as a total lack of interest. 

Finally, price could NOT CORRECT AT ALL. There is absolutely no reason why price has to correct now, it just seems logical for it to do so, but this is in no way obligatory. If price breaks the  resistance zone  before having had any corrections, then simply wait for a retest of the  resistance zone  turned new  support zone  and buy from there. Either way, everyones a winner. 

Feel free to leave a comment letting me know where you think price will go, I would be very interested to hear everyones thoughts. 

This idea will continue to be updated if the idea receives sufficient attention.

This is because not only is the uptrend slightly extended, but also because the target I chose was exactly where the 200 major moving average began to act as a resistance, which was also predicted in my previous analysis. For this reason, we must now be nimble before placing a long position in  Bitcoin 2.64%  to avoid becoming part of a bull trap.  

Swiftly moving onto the grit of this analysis,  Bitcoin 2.64%  is currently trading right at the horizontal  resistance zone , coinciding with the 200 major moving average resistance between 6930 and 6820. As it stands the  candlestick  looks strong showing there was a crisp  bullish  move to my target without much objection. What goes up must come down. Logic dictates that now price has hit the  resistance zone , it will need to catch it's breath again before a new pump. 

Price will now do one of 2 things before the next move.  

Firstly, price will correct from the horizontal  resistance zone  down to the side-wards support line, before bouncing off the line and using it as support, with a new upside move taking place. If this scenario happens, it shows the bigger buyers are still interested in pumping price and it is a safe bet, if, a little aggressive also. 

Secondly, price could correct from the horizontal  resistance zone , trade downwards, breaking the side-wards support line and into the previous horizontal  support zone  that the previous rally came off of, between 6280 and 6170. If price gets to this level, we want to see a quick, and sharp upside move. Any hanging around at this level after such recent upside would be suspicious and could be perceived as a total lack of interest. 

Finally, price could NOT CORRECT AT ALL. There is absolutely no reason why price has to correct now, it just seems logical for it to do so, but this is in no way obligatory. If price breaks the  resistance zone  before having had any corrections, then simply wait for a retest of the  resistance zone  turned new  support zone  and buy from there. Either way, everyones a winner. 

Feel free to leave a comment letting me know where you think price will go, I would be very interested to hear everyones thoughts. 

This idea will continue to be updated if the idea receives sufficient attention.

1530720921.0,GreenDillys,BTC Hourly update: Rising Wedge Forming,"
Over the last two days, we've seen rising price action from  BTC 2.64% , but that  bullish  sentiment looks about to fail us. A  rising wedge  forming on our hourly chart indicates an incoming breakout. This looks like an ideal setup for a short position, with a break downwards from the  wedge  expected at around 13:00 EST tomorrow afternoon. A breakout below the 6515  support level  would confirm this breakout. Entry is recommended on the retest of the 6650 level after having broken the  wedge , with a stop-loss placed at 6720. First target is 6415 with a second target at 6290.

""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" quote by Arthur Conan Doyle from the Sherlock series.  

Let me start by discussing the boxed pattern. Believe you me, I dug into all timeframes trying to find the slightest reason to allow me to draw it as a 5 wave structure. But I can't; there is just now way to draw it other than a 3 wave structure. 

Now -  
We only have two possibilities to start:  
a) 3-3-3-3-3  leading diagonal  giving a  bullish  count 
b) 3-3-5 flat corrective pattern  
*obviously, a corrective pattern may unfold into combo waves, but there are only these two possibilities for the short term.  

Because of the daily dogi and the price action, along with major alts approaching critical levels and  RSI  breaching 65 ( bearish  reversal zone) on higher TFs, I am  bullish  biased.  

Unfortunately, my count of  leading diagonal  has been invalidated (more in update later). 
This leads me to believe we are in a 3-3-5 pattern whilst acknowledging all the  bullish  signals. 
A 3-3-5  ABC  count will give wave C an  ending diagonal  pattern. The diagonal's wave 3 will have  volume  bar confirmation as labelled. 

More updates later.

Bitcoin's first moon trip is about to hit target (Fib 1.414).  Seeing price climb a measly 2.4% is so agonizing.  Alts are fairing much better this time around. I do not anticipate price to hold above the target. This rocket is done for... at least for now. The best is yet to come for  Bitcoin 2.64% . :)

I'm thinking a  double top  into a plummet down to 6135-6133 (making a sweet  inverse head and shoulders ) 

If you don't think it'll go down that far, check out the chart i posted before this one. It has higher entry targets.

					Personally, i'm in a long from 6500. I'm going to be waiting to see what happens once we test that top again. If it luls and shows signs of reversing i'm swapping to a short.

Bitcoin's first moon trip is about to hit target (Fib 1.414).  Seeing price climb a measly 2.4% is so agonizing.  Alts are fairing much better this time around. I do not anticipate price to hold above the target. This rocket is done for... at least for now. The best is yet to come for  Bitcoin             . :) 

I have 3 targets setup for  Bitcoin              in this bull season. They are stated in this chart below.

After our recent successful trade in  Bitcoin 2.64% , we now need to reassess  Bitcoins 2.64%  movements to best decide what to do next. If you remember from my last analysis, I expected a retest on support and a breakout move to the next  structure resistance  level. This trade went perfectly to plan and we was highly successful with this. Now that price is at the above horizontal  resistance zone , price is somewhat at a juncture. This is because not only is the uptrend slightly extended, but also because the target I chose was exactly where the 200 major moving average began to act as a resistance, which was also predicted in my previous analysis. For this reason, we must now be nimble before placing a long position in  Bitcoin 2.64%  to avoid becoming part of a bull trap.  

Swiftly moving onto the grit of this analysis,  Bitcoin 2.64%  is currently trading right at the horizontal  resistance zone , coinciding with the 200 major moving average resistance between 6930 and 6820. As it stands the  candlestick  looks strong showing there was a crisp  bullish  move to my target without much objection. What goes up must come down. Logic dictates that now price has hit the  resistance zone , it will need to catch it's breath again before a new pump. 

Price will now do one of 2 things before the next move.  

Firstly, price will correct from the horizontal  resistance zone  down to the side-wards support line, before bouncing off the line and using it as support, with a new upside move taking place. If this scenario happens, it shows the bigger buyers are still interested in pumping price and it is a safe bet, if, a little aggressive also. 

Secondly, price could correct from the horizontal  resistance zone , trade downwards, breaking the side-wards support line and into the previous horizontal  support zone  that the previous rally came off of, between 6280 and 6170. If price gets to this level, we want to see a quick, and sharp upside move. Any hanging around at this level after such recent upside would be suspicious and could be perceived as a total lack of interest. 

Finally, price could NOT CORRECT AT ALL. There is absolutely no reason why price has to correct now, it just seems logical for it to do so, but this is in no way obligatory. If price breaks the  resistance zone  before having had any corrections, then simply wait for a retest of the  resistance zone  turned new  support zone  and buy from there. Either way, everyones a winner. 

Feel free to leave a comment letting me know where you think price will go, I would be very interested to hear everyones thoughts. 

This idea will continue to be updated if the idea receives sufficient attention.

1530720921.0,GreenDillys,BTC Hourly update: Rising Wedge Forming,"
Over the last two days, we've seen rising price action from  BTC 2.64% , but that  bullish  sentiment looks about to fail us. A  rising wedge  forming on our hourly chart indicates an incoming breakout. This looks like an ideal setup for a short position, with a break downwards from the  wedge  expected at around 13:00 EST tomorrow afternoon. A breakout below the 6515  support level  would confirm this breakout. Entry is recommended on the retest of the 6650 level after having broken the  wedge , with a stop-loss placed at 6720. First target is 6415 with a second target at 6290. 

This is not financial advice.

""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" quote by Arthur Conan Doyle from the Sherlock series.  

Let me start by discussing the boxed pattern. Believe you me, I dug into all timeframes trying to find the slightest reason to allow me to draw it as a 5 wave structure. But I can't; there is just now way to draw it other than a 3 wave structure. 

Now -  
We only have two possibilities to start:  
a) 3-3-3-3-3  leading diagonal  giving a  bullish  count 
b) 3-3-5 flat corrective pattern  
*obviously, a corrective pattern may unfold into combo waves, but there are only these two possibilities for the short term.  

Because of the daily dogi and the price action, along with major alts approaching critical levels and  RSI  breaching 65 ( bearish  reversal zone) on higher TFs, I am  bullish  biased.  

Unfortunately, my count of  leading diagonal  has been invalidated (more in update later). 
This leads me to believe we are in a 3-3-5 pattern whilst acknowledging all the  bullish  signals. 
A 3-3-5  ABC  count will give wave C an  ending diagonal  pattern. The diagonal's wave 3 will have  volume  bar confirmation as labelled. 

More updates later.

""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" quote by Arthur Conan Doyle from the Sherlock series.  

Let me start by discussing the boxed pattern. Believe you me, I dug into all timeframes trying to find the slightest reason to allow me to draw it as a 5 wave structure. But I can't; there is just now way to draw it other than a 3 wave structure. 

Now -  
We only have two possibilities to start:  
a) 3-3-3-3-3  leading diagonal  giving a  bullish  count 
b) 3-3-5 flat corrective pattern  
*obviously, a corrective pattern may unfold into combo waves, but there are only these two possibilities for the short term.  

Because of the daily dogi and the price action, along with major alts approaching critical levels and  RSI  breaching 65 ( bearish  reversal zone) on higher TFs, I am  bullish  biased.  

Unfortunately, my count of  leading diagonal  has been invalidated (more in update later). 
This leads me to believe we are in a 3-3-5 pattern whilst acknowledging all the  bullish  signals. 
A 3-3-5  ABC  count will give wave C an  ending diagonal  pattern. The diagonal's wave 3 will have  volume  bar confirmation as labelled.

Bitcoin's first moon trip is about to hit target (Fib 1.414).  Seeing price climb a measly 2.4% is so agonizing.  Alts are fairing much better this time around. I do not anticipate price to hold above the target. This rocket is done for... at least for now. The best is yet to come for  Bitcoin 2.64% . :)

After our recent successful trade in  Bitcoin 2.64% , we now need to reassess  Bitcoins 2.64%  movements to best decide what to do next. If you remember from my last analysis, I expected a retest on support and a breakout move to the next  structure resistance  level. This trade went perfectly to plan and we was highly successful with this. Now that price is at the above horizontal  resistance zone , price is somewhat at a juncture. This is because not only is the uptrend slightly extended, but also because the target I chose was exactly where the 200 major moving average began to act as a resistance, which was also predicted in my previous analysis. For this reason, we must now be nimble before placing a long position in  Bitcoin 2.64%  to avoid becoming part of a bull trap.  

Swiftly moving onto the grit of this analysis,  Bitcoin 2.64%  is currently trading right at the horizontal  resistance zone , coinciding with the 200 major moving average resistance between 6930 and 6820. As it stands the  candlestick  looks strong showing there was a crisp  bullish  move to my target without much objection. What goes up must come down. Logic dictates that now price has hit the  resistance zone , it will need to catch it's breath again before a new pump. 

Price will now do one of 2 things before the next move.  

Firstly, price will correct from the horizontal  resistance zone  down to the side-wards support line, before bouncing off the line and using it as support, with a new upside move taking place. If this scenario happens, it shows the bigger buyers are still interested in pumping price and it is a safe bet, if, a little aggressive also. 

Secondly, price could correct from the horizontal  resistance zone , trade downwards, breaking the side-wards support line and into the previous horizontal  support zone  that the previous rally came off of, between 6280 and 6170. If price gets to this level, we want to see a quick, and sharp upside move. Any hanging around at this level after such recent upside would be suspicious and could be perceived as a total lack of interest. 

Finally, price could NOT CORRECT AT ALL. There is absolutely no reason why price has to correct now, it just seems logical for it to do so, but this is in no way obligatory. If price breaks the  resistance zone  before having had any corrections, then simply wait for a retest of the  resistance zone  turned new  support zone  and buy from there. Either way, everyones a winner. 

Feel free to leave a comment letting me know where you think price will go, I would be very interested to hear everyones thoughts. 

This idea will continue to be updated if the idea receives sufficient attention.

Over the last two days, we've seen rising price action from  BTC 2.64% , but that  bullish  sentiment looks about to fail us. A  rising wedge  forming on our hourly chart indicates an incoming breakout. This looks like an ideal setup for a short position, with a break downwards from the  wedge  expected at around 13:00 EST tomorrow afternoon. A breakout below the 6515  support level  would confirm this breakout. Entry is recommended on the retest of the 6650 level after having broken the  wedge , with a stop-loss placed at 6720. First target is 6415 with a second target at 6290.

""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" quote by Arthur Conan Doyle from the Sherlock series.  

Let me start by discussing the boxed pattern. Believe you me, I dug into all timeframes trying to find the slightest reason to allow me to draw it as a 5 wave structure. But I can't; there is just now way to draw it other than a 3 wave structure. 

Now -  
We only have two possibilities to start:  
a) 3-3-3-3-3  leading diagonal  giving a  bullish  count 
b) 3-3-5 flat corrective pattern  
*obviously, a corrective pattern may unfold into combo waves, but there are only these two possibilities for the short term.  

Because of the daily dogi and the price action, along with major alts approaching critical levels and  RSI  breaching 65 ( bearish  reversal zone) on higher TFs, I am  bullish  biased.  

Unfortunately, my count of  leading diagonal  has been invalidated (more in update later). 
This leads me to believe we are in a 3-3-5 pattern whilst acknowledging all the  bullish  signals. 
A 3-3-5  ABC  count will give wave C an  ending diagonal  pattern. The diagonal's wave 3 will have  volume  bar confirmation as labelled.

Bitcoin's first moon trip is about to hit target (Fib 1.414).  Seeing price climb a measly 2.4% is so agonizing.  Alts are fairing much better this time around. I do not anticipate price to hold above the target. This rocket is done for... at least for now. The best is yet to come for  Bitcoin 2.48% . :)

1530718924.0,TomProTrader,BTC/USD - Further Buy Opportunity,"
After our recent successful trade in  Bitcoin 2.48% , we now need to reassess  Bitcoins 2.48%  movements to best decide what to do next. If you remember from my last analysis, I expected a retest on support and a breakout move to the next  structure resistance  level. This trade went perfectly to plan and we was highly successful with this. Now that price is at the above horizontal  resistance zone , price is somewhat at a juncture. This is because not only is the uptrend slightly extended, but also because the target I chose was exactly where the 200 major moving average began to act as a resistance, which was also predicted in my previous analysis. For this reason, we must now be nimble before placing a long position in  Bitcoin 2.48%  to avoid becoming part of a bull trap.  

Swiftly moving onto the grit of this analysis,  Bitcoin 2.48%  is currently trading right at the horizontal  resistance zone , coinciding with the 200 major moving average resistance between 6930 and 6820. As it stands the  candlestick  looks strong showing there was a crisp  bullish  move to my target without much objection. What goes up must come down. Logic dictates that now price has hit the  resistance zone , it will need to catch it's breath again before a new pump. 

Price will now do one of 2 things before the next move.  

Firstly, price will correct from the horizontal  resistance zone  down to the side-wards support line, before bouncing off the line and using it as support, with a new upside move taking place. If this scenario happens, it shows the bigger buyers are still interested in pumping price and it is a safe bet, if, a little aggressive also. 

Secondly, price could correct from the horizontal  resistance zone , trade downwards, breaking the side-wards support line and into the previous horizontal  support zone  that the previous rally came off of, between 6280 and 6170. If price gets to this level, we want to see a quick, and sharp upside move. Any hanging around at this level after such recent upside would be suspicious and could be perceived as a total lack of interest. 

Finally, price could NOT CORRECT AT ALL. There is absolutely no reason why price has to correct now, it just seems logical for it to do so, but this is in no way obligatory. If price breaks the  resistance zone  before having had any corrections, then simply wait for a retest of the  resistance zone  turned new  support zone  and buy from there. Either way, everyones a winner. 

Feel free to leave a comment letting me know where you think price will go, I would be very interested to hear everyones thoughts.

1530720921.0,GreenDillys,BTC Hourly update: Rising Wedge Forming,"
Over the last two days, we've seen rising price action from  BTC 2.48% , but that  bullish  sentiment looks about to fail us. A  rising wedge  forming on our hourly chart indicates an incoming breakout. This looks like an ideal setup for a short position, with a break downwards from the  wedge  expected at around 13:00 EST tomorrow afternoon. A breakout below the 6515  support level  would confirm this breakout. Entry is recommended on the retest of the 6650 level after having broken the  wedge , with a stop-loss placed at 6720. First target is 6415 with a second target at 6290. 

This is not financial advice.

- The Binance news didn't seem to affect the market due to their professional handling of the situation.  
- The current Daily Candle is hitting the 30 and 10  EMA . (The circled area) 
- Give it another day or so to resolve but it'll be interesting to see where this goes.  
- The bulls will need some more  volume  and momentum since it's been 4-6 days of solid upwards price action.

1530720921.0,GreenDillys,BTC Hourly update: Rising Wedge Forming,"
Over the last two days, we've seen rising price action from  BTC 2.45% , but that  bullish  sentiment looks about to fail us. A  rising wedge  forming on our hourly chart indicates an incoming breakout. This looks like an ideal setup for a short position, with a break downwards from the  wedge  expected at around 13:00 EST tomorrow afternoon. A breakout below the 6515  support level  would confirm this breakout. Entry is recommended on the retest of the 6650 level after having broken the  wedge , with a stop-loss placed at 6720. First target is 6415 with a second target at 6290. 

This is not financial advice.

""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" quote by Arthur Conan Doyle from the Sherlock series.  

Let me start by discussing the boxed pattern. Believe you me, I dug into all timeframes trying to find the slightest reason to allow me to draw it as a 5 wave structure. But I can't; there is just now way to draw it other than a 3 wave structure. 

Now -  
We only have two possibilities to start:  
a) 3-3-3-3-3  leading diagonal  giving a  bullish  count 
b) 3-3-5 flat corrective pattern  
*obviously, a corrective pattern may unfold into combo waves, but there are only these two possibilities for the short term.  

Because of the daily dogi and the price action, along with major alts approaching critical levels and  RSI  breaching 65 ( bearish  reversal zone) on higher TFs, I am  bullish  biased.  

Unfortunately, my count of  leading diagonal  has been invalidated (more in update later). 
This leads me to believe we are in a 3-3-5 pattern whilst acknowledging all the  bullish  signals. 
A 3-3-5  ABC  count will give wave C an  ending diagonal  pattern. The diagonal's wave 3 will have  volume  bar confirmation as labelled.

After our recent successful trade in  Bitcoin             , we now need to reassess  Bitcoins              movements to best decide what to do next. If you remember from my last analysis, I expected a retest on support and a breakout move to the next  structure resistance  level. This trade went perfectly to plan and we was highly successful with this. Now that price is at the above horizontal  resistance zone , price is somewhat at a juncture. This is because not only is the uptrend slightly extended, but also because the target I chose was exactly where the 200 major moving average began to act as a resistance, which was also predicted in my previous analysis. For this reason, we must now be nimble before placing a long position in  Bitcoin              to avoid becoming part of a bull trap.  

Swiftly moving onto the grit of this analysis,  Bitcoin              is currently trading right at the horizontal  resistance zone , coinciding with the 200 major moving average resistance between 6930 and 6820. As it stands the  candlestick  looks strong showing there was a crisp  bullish  move to my target without much objection. What goes up must come down. Logic dictates that now price has hit the  resistance zone , it will need to catch it's breath again before a new pump. 

Price will now do one of 2 things before the next move.  

Firstly, price will correct from the horizontal  resistance zone  down to the side-wards support line, before bouncing off the line and using it as support, with a new upside move taking place. If this scenario happens, it shows the bigger buyers are still interested in pumping price and it is a safe bet, if, a little aggressive also. 

Secondly, price could correct from the horizontal  resistance zone , trade downwards, breaking the side-wards support line and into the previous horizontal  support zone  that the previous rally came off of, between 6280 and 6170. If price gets to this level, we want to see a quick, and sharp upside move. Any hanging around at this level after such recent upside would be suspicious and could be perceived as a total lack of interest. 

Finally, price could NOT CORRECT AT ALL. There is absolutely no reason why price has to correct now, it just seems logical for it to do so, but this is in no way obligatory. If price breaks the  resistance zone  before having had any corrections, then simply wait for a retest of the  resistance zone  turned new  support zone  and buy from there. Either way, everyones a winner. 

Feel free to leave a comment letting me know where you think price will go, I would be very interested to hear everyones thoughts. 

This idea will continue to be updated if the idea receives sufficient attention.

Swiftly moving onto the grit of this analysis,  Bitcoin              is currently trading right at the horizontal  resistance zone , coinciding with the 200 major moving average resistance between 6930 and 6820. As it stands the  candlestick  looks strong showing there was a crisp  bullish  move to my target without much objection. What goes up must come down. Logic dictates that now price has hit the  resistance zone , it will need to catch it's breath again before a new pump. 

Price will now do one of 2 things before the next move.  

Firstly, price will correct from the horizontal  resistance zone  down to the side-wards support line, before bouncing off the line and using it as support, with a new upside move taking place. If this scenario happens, it shows the bigger buyers are still interested in pumping price and it is a safe bet, if, a little aggressive also. 

Secondly, price could correct from the horizontal  resistance zone , trade downwards, breaking the side-wards support line and into the previous horizontal  support zone  that the previous rally came off of, between 6280 and 6170. If price gets to this level, we want to see a quick, and sharp upside move. Any hanging around at this level after such recent upside would be suspicious and could be perceived as a total lack of interest. 

Finally, price could NOT CORRECT AT ALL. There is absolutely no reason why price has to correct now, it just seems logical for it to do so, but this is in no way obligatory. If price breaks the  resistance zone  before having had any corrections, then simply wait for a retest of the  resistance zone  turned new  support zone  and buy from there. Either way, everyones a winner. 

Feel free to leave a comment letting me know where you think price will go, I would be very interested to hear everyones thoughts. 

This idea will continue to be updated if the idea receives sufficient attention.

1530720921.0,GreenDillys,BTC Hourly update: Rising Wedge Forming,"
Over the last two days, we've seen rising price action from  BTC 2.35% , but that  bullish  sentiment looks about to fail us. A  rising wedge  forming on our hourly chart indicates an incoming breakout. This looks like an ideal setup for a short position, with a break downwards from the  wedge  expected at around 13:00 EST tomorrow afternoon. A breakout below the 6515  support level  would confirm this breakout. Entry is recommended on the retest of the 6650 level after having broken the  wedge , with a stop-loss placed at 6720. First target is 6415 with a second target at 6290. 

This is not financial advice.

""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" quote by Arthur Conan Doyle from the Sherlock series.  

Let me start by discussing the boxed pattern. Believe you me, I dug into all timeframes trying to find the slightest reason to allow me to draw it as a 5 wave structure. But I can't; there is just now way to draw it other than a 3 wave structure. 

Now -  
We only have two possibilities to start:  
a) 3-3-3-3-3  leading diagonal  giving a  bullish  count 
b) 3-3-5 flat corrective pattern  
*obviously, a corrective pattern may unfold into combo waves, but there are only these two possibilities for the short term.  

Because of the daily dogi and the price action, along with major alts approaching critical levels and  RSI  breaching 65 ( bearish  reversal zone) on higher TFs, I am  bullish  biased.  

Unfortunately, my count of  leading diagonal  has been invalidated (more in update later). 
This leads me to believe we are in a 3-3-5 pattern whilst acknowledging all the  bullish  signals. 
A 3-3-5  ABC  count will give wave C an  ending diagonal  pattern. The diagonal's wave 3 will have  volume  bar confirmation as labelled. 

More updates later.

If you don't think it'll go down that far, check out the chart i posted before this one. It has higher entry targets.

Bitcoin's first moon trip is about to hit target (Fib 1.414).  Seeing price climb a measly 2.4% is so agonizing.  Alts are fairing much better this time around. I do not anticipate price to hold above the target. This rocket is done for... at least for now. The best is yet to come for  Bitcoin             . :) 

I have 3 targets setup for  Bitcoin              in this bull season. They are stated in this chart below.

After our recent successful trade in  Bitcoin             , we now need to reassess  Bitcoins              movements to best decide what to do next. If you remember from my last analysis, I expected a retest on support and a breakout move to the next  structure resistance  level. This trade went perfectly to plan and we was highly successful with this. Now that price is at the above horizontal  resistance zone , price is somewhat at a juncture. This is because not only is the uptrend slightly extended, but also because the target I chose was exactly where the 200 major moving average began to act as a resistance, which was also predicted in my previous analysis.
