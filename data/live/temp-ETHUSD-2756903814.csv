I wanted to start a new thread because we have a lot going on with ETH right now in these charts.  

This post is going to look at potential scenarios of when ETH is going to get more of a SUBSTANTIAL run up. Or when the BOTTOM of ETH could appear, maybe soon? 

Let's first start with some technicals. Weekly  MACD  is still moving down heavily and weekly  RSI  is still not in oversold territory. The Daily  MACD  is still drifting down and  RSI  still has not reached oversold territory yet. the concern here is that because we are in a down trend that we will continue past this bottom in a simple  ABCD pattern . Until we break this orange  trendline , this is a possible scenario. I will address 3 key questions here with various charts. 

Q: Sherem, What are you looking for to see if this is the bottom? 
A. For this to be a bottom we need to invalidate that large ORANGE  trendline  that I have on my chart here. Let's look back in April when we had that large rally where a couple things occurred: 
1. That down  trendline  was invalidated by a long sideways movement which had a move up and then found support again. 
2.  RSI  went into oversold territory and we are not there yet. 
3.  MACD  had a nice cross and we rallied hard. 

Right now we are not there yet. If we break that orange  trendline , I want to see a test of $500 and a pullback for an entry point for a move to the upside.

					Q: Sherem, What do you think it could do on a shorter time frame? 

A. This chart is zoomed in with that orange trend line. It's critical that we break it and create a ""higher high"" which still hasn't happened yet, even with this large push. We have created a series of lower lows in the last month. This usually indicates that we continue to get a move lower. For me to feel comfortable entering a trade I want to see some sort of push higher or pattern that indicates we will move higher. 

We did have some ladders down here that have been adjusted periodically. If you got filled you should be in a good position and be able to book some profits or put a stop loss on your position to protect your profits.

					Q: Sherem, why do you think it could go down even lower? Shouldn't this be the bottom? 

A. The best comparison I have is when ETH hit it's double bottom back in March at 600. A lot of people thought this was the low, but it blew through it and went down to 400. We can look to ETH/BTC for the answer to this. ETH/BTC had just broken the upwards trendline and started to move down. We were already in a strong downtrend and ETH/BTC further ratified the move down. What happened next on ETH/BTC is that we then created a ""higher low"" and broke this trendline. If this continues on pace, it's going to be a slower move to the downside. We have a couple places we could base out and while I think .04 will be more likely, we will have to see how it plays out.

Hope this idea helps! 
Don’t forget to Like/Follow if you enjoyed this post :) 

This will be a winning trade of at least 3% since our trailing stop loss indicator is already above our short buy-in price! So awesome!! 
 
Our traders are up overall a total of 7.45% on this short trade and I personally think we will see the price dip back down again before we go long, but if we do go long, we will all receive the long alert and our traders will ride the price up for long gains! 

The number one reason I see people lose money while trading is due to emotions. When I coded these indicators it was my goal to create a trading system based around logic so our traders didn't have to trade with so much emotion. The ability to trade simply with alerts to your phone and email will change the way you trade.  

Let the indicators do all the worrying about when the best time is to enter, and you just focus on placing the trades. If you were to just do this, you would have made the profits shown on the video from all of our backtests/live results.  

Get these indicators today, set up the alerts, and start making profits for yourself!!

Bloomberg crypto index has held its ground and managed no to break below previous Feb lows! 
RSI  has broken downtrend resistance for the first time since the failed  UA -3.48%  at 10k. 

Now we watch. I expect another test of the lows before marking up!

1530320757.0,MarcPMarkets,ETHUSD: Short Squeeze Setting Up. Can Lead To 490s.,"
 ETHUSD 3.37%  update: This market is poised to rally. The break of the 443 previous candle high was a long trigger. I am not calling any trade ideas on here because that is what S.C. is for, but I will highlight the potential. 

Price went as low as 405 which looked ugly, but the key is how the candle closes. This candle that established the low closed strong, and it this materialized off of the 423 reversal zone boundary. A  bullish  sign to say the least. 

I have been writing on S.C., that these markets are bottoming, but it takes time and a lot of patience. The structure and location have been weighing probability on the side of strength, even in the face of the recent  bearish  price action. 

The current low of 405 is not dramatically lower than the recent 450 swing low. Along with that, all of this price action is still occurring well above the 374 historical low. This sums up to a broad higher low formation and  BTC 2.93%  is doing the same thing basically. 

If these markets rally, a short term expectation is at least the 490s for this market. That is a conservative view since the short term  bearish  structures are still intact and must be considered until they are taken out.  

In summary, broader structure and location are panting a picture of reward/risk that is skewed toward the  bullish  side across these markets. The  bearish  structures that are still in play suggest conservative expectations would be most appropriate for size, target and stop. 

Remember that market bottoms are a process and take time to develop. In that process lows can be tested and retested before any meaningful progress on the long side unfolds. Any new swing trade long ideas that we take on S.C., will be shared with our followers.
