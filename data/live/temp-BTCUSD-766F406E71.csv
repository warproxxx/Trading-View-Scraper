I see that the bulls' impossibility to break out the resistance lines drawn in the chart are the reason why  btc 0.50%  has just drop 70 bucks in the last five minutes. If bulls can't sustain that upside  trend line  this is over folks, we're going under 6.4k. I knew it, I don't know why choose to keep this long position open. Any help?

					Maybe I'm passed out munching NUtella as an idiot, but I don't see btc has a chance... se the trend like in the 15 minutes frame, and what we've got is that support has turned into resistance. Just like the great players in the soccer world cup, are useless. are they?

#BTC to $7k soon?  

We're seeing a possible  H&S  formation and  MFI  increasing.  

BTC              has been constantly testing the resistance line but it's getting closer the cloud, if it can't hold above it could be another drop.

Shift from higher lows and higher highs, then a shift to a lower high and a lower low breaking the neckline of support  

Break of 6451 is a clear bear break losing the 4hr higher low pattern 

If we can hold 6451 that is a good sign for an  inside bar  bull break on the daily
