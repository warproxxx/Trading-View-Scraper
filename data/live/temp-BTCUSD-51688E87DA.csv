Price 
Bitcoin -0.39%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.39% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

BTC -0.40%  almost completed the  triangle pattern  and  RSI  shows a  bearish trend .

Here we publish signals of the indicator called “Ranger”. It was developed by our experts for intraday trading purposes.  
This indicator is based on statistical analysis of the data and provides information about possible maximum/minimum values of the day (just right after the day has started) with certain probabilities.  
What does this information give to the trader? Actually, a lot. First of all, trading signals. For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability. So, you can open a position opposite to the current movement, knowing in advance that it will be profitable with certain probability.

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th -3.45%  of Feb,  cuz -1.04%  it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th              of Feb,  cuz              it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Price 
Bitcoin -0.40%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.40% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.”

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th              of Feb,  cuz              it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Price 
Bitcoin -0.39%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.39% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th              of Feb,  cuz              it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Price 
Bitcoin -0.39%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.39% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th -3.45%  of Feb,  cuz -1.04%  it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Price 
Bitcoin -0.40%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.40% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

BTC -0.40%  almost completed the  triangle pattern  and  RSI  shows a  bearish trend .

Price 
Bitcoin -0.40%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.40% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

BTC -0.40%  almost completed the  triangle pattern  and  RSI  shows a  bearish trend .

This indicator is based on statistical analysis of the data and provides information about possible maximum/minimum values of the day (just right after the day has started) with certain probabilities.  
What does this information give to the trader? Actually, a lot. First of all, trading signals. For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability.

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th -3.45%  of Feb,  cuz              it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.40% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

I don't short  BTC -0.40%  this time because I consider we are too close to a very strong  support level  but I am  bearish  on the short term. 

BTC -0.40%  almost completed the  triangle pattern  and  RSI  shows a  bearish trend .  

I think  BTC -0.40%  will break the triangle with a down trend move to reach a first step at 5800$ in the coming hours/days.

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th -3.45%  of Feb,  cuz              it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Price 
Bitcoin -0.40%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

I don't short  BTC -0.40%  this time because I consider we are too close to a very strong  support level  but I am  bearish  on the short term. 

BTC -0.40%  almost completed the  triangle pattern  and  RSI  shows a  bearish trend .  

I think  BTC -0.40%  will break the triangle with a down trend move to reach a first step at 5800$ in the coming hours/days.

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th              of Feb,  cuz              it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Price 
Bitcoin -0.40%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.40% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability. So, you can open a position opposite to the current movement, knowing in advance that it will be profitable with certain probability.

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th              of Feb,  cuz              it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Price 
Bitcoin -0.40%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.40% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th -3.45%  of Feb,  cuz              it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Price 
Bitcoin -0.40%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.40% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

This indicator is based on statistical analysis of the data and provides information about possible maximum/minimum values of the day (just right after the day has started) with certain probabilities.  
What does this information give to the trader? Actually, a lot. First of all, trading signals. For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability.

So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Price 
Bitcoin -0.40%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.40% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

Here we publish signals of the indicator called “Ranger”. It was developed by our experts for intraday trading purposes.  
This indicator is based on statistical analysis of the data and provides information about possible maximum/minimum values of the day (just right after the day has started) with certain probabilities.  
What does this information give to the trader? Actually, a lot. First of all, trading signals. For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability. So, you can open a position opposite to the current movement, knowing in advance that it will be profitable with certain probability.

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th -3.45%  of Feb,  cuz              it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :)

According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.40% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th -3.45%  of Feb,  cuz              it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

BTC -0.40%  almost completed the  triangle pattern  and  RSI  shows a  bearish trend .

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th -3.45%  of Feb,  cuz              it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Price 
Bitcoin -0.40%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.40% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th -3.45%  of Feb,  cuz              it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Price 
Bitcoin -0.29%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.29% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th -3.45%  of Feb,  cuz -1.04%  it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Price 
Bitcoin -0.29%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.29% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

Here we publish signals of the indicator called “Ranger”. It was developed by our experts for intraday trading purposes.  
This indicator is based on statistical analysis of the data and provides information about possible maximum/minimum values of the day (just right after the day has started) with certain probabilities.  
What does this information give to the trader? Actually, a lot. First of all, trading signals. For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability.

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th -3.45%  of Feb,  cuz -1.04%  it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Price 
Bitcoin -0.23%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.23% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

BTC -0.22%  almost completed the  triangle pattern  and  RSI  shows a  bearish trend .

Here we publish signals of the indicator called “Ranger”. It was developed by our experts for intraday trading purposes.  
This indicator is based on statistical analysis of the data and provides information about possible maximum/minimum values of the day (just right after the day has started) with certain probabilities.  
What does this information give to the trader? Actually, a lot. First of all, trading signals. For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability.

Price 
Bitcoin -0.21%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.21% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

I don't short  BTC -0.22%  this time because I consider we are too close to a very strong  support level  but I am  bearish  on the short term. 

BTC -0.22%  almost completed the  triangle pattern  and  RSI  shows a  bearish trend .  

I think  BTC -0.22%  will break the triangle with a down trend move to reach a first step at 5800$ in the coming hours/days.

This indicator is based on statistical analysis of the data and provides information about possible maximum/minimum values of the day (just right after the day has started) with certain probabilities.  
What does this information give to the trader? Actually, a lot. First of all, trading signals.

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th              of Feb,  cuz              it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th              of Feb,  cuz              it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Price 
Bitcoin -0.32%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

Here we publish signals of the indicator called “Ranger”. It was developed by our experts for intraday trading purposes.  
This indicator is based on statistical analysis of the data and provides information about possible maximum/minimum values of the day (just right after the day has started) with certain probabilities.  
What does this information give to the trader? Actually, a lot. First of all, trading signals. For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability. So, you can open a position opposite to the current movement, knowing in advance that it will be profitable with certain probability.

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th              of Feb,  cuz              it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Price 
Bitcoin -0.32%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.32% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th              of Feb,  cuz              it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Price 
Bitcoin -0.32%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.32% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

This indicator is based on statistical analysis of the data and provides information about possible maximum/minimum values of the day (just right after the day has started) with certain probabilities.  
What does this information give to the trader? Actually, a lot. First of all, trading signals. For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability.

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th -3.45%  of Feb,  cuz              it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Price 
Bitcoin -0.33%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.33% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

Price 
Bitcoin -0.33%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.33% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

This indicator is based on statistical analysis of the data and provides information about possible maximum/minimum values of the day (just right after the day has started) with certain probabilities.  
What does this information give to the trader? Actually, a lot. First of all, trading signals. For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability.

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th -3.45%  of Feb,  cuz              it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin             , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

BTC -0.32%  almost completed the  triangle pattern  and  RSI  shows a  bearish trend .

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th              of Feb,  cuz              it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Price 
Bitcoin -0.32%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast

BTC -0.32%  almost completed the  triangle pattern  and  RSI  shows a  bearish trend .

This indicator is based on statistical analysis of the data and provides information about possible maximum/minimum values of the day (just right after the day has started) with certain probabilities.  
What does this information give to the trader? Actually, a lot. First of all, trading signals. For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability.

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th -3.45%  of Feb,  cuz              it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Price 
Bitcoin -0.32%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.32% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability. So, you can open a position opposite to the current movement, knowing in advance that it will be profitable with certain probability.

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th -3.45%  of Feb,  cuz              it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Price 
Bitcoin -0.32%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.

US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.32% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

This is what I see the past few months 

You might heard of ""5th theory"" 

Before we move on, I want to tell something first. 
I am not a fan of saying.... ""it will go to moon in Feb, Mar, April""...etc.  
Especially if it baseless, I HATE it. 

But this might be interesting :) 

My hypothesis is ""expire date of margin trade in  OTC              market is 5th of every month"" 
and HUGE whales or institutions wanted to manipulate market to make profit as much as possible. 

If my hypothesis is true, we can leverage it in very useful ways to make profit. 
I will show you in last part of this posting. 

I can say a little about  6th -3.45%  of Feb,  cuz -1.04%  it was just starting date 


March 5th 





		Some people call it EW wave failure, I agree with it. 
They HAD to make it lower than $11,788 and HAD to make it as high as possible to make their short betting profitable. 
So, the price should be around 90% correction of it - you will see the 90%+ correction again and again :) 


April 5th 





		Now, Whales wanted to go on a LONG in next month. 
So, they made it impulse wave by force - 1st wave 
also 90%+ but less than 100% will be the best to make most profit 


May 5th 





		Again, EASY money 


June 5th 





		This was quite interesting 
As you can see, it goes down till end of the month.  
HOWEVER, whales wanted to keep their short one more month 
They already closed their position at the end of the month, and made it little bit higher to get MOST profit with shorting 
So, they keep pushing it down, and finally break down the  wedge , go up to 0.90%+ correction, make a downside impulse wave. 

understand it? 

Ok than, how we can leverage it? 

Just keep looking price from end of June to 5th of July 


If it follows like this... 

#1. 





		Just short it at 90% correction 


#2 





		Just long it at 90% correction 

Yeah even if my hypothesis is true, you might miss the final bottom (or top)  
But don`t worry you can get into RIGHT position with lowest risk :)

Price 
Bitcoin -0.33%  spending a third day in a narrowing diapason between  Bearish Trend Line  and 6000.0 level. Though yesterday we saw a short-term dip to the 5990.0, for now, the price has returned to the lateral movement. According to  volume  distribution, the most trades happen on the 6100.0 level, which is a positive sign, as it pulls the price away from the 6000.0. From the other side, too-long lateral trading in narrow range talks about too low trust and demand, which could result in further dips of the price. Anyway, in near-term perspective, the price will have to meet the  Bearish Trend Line  and decide once more, whether it ready to break it and attempt to go up or will fall again. I repeat that the breakout requires confirmation in the form of large volumes and a rise above 6300.0. From the below 6000.0 – 5750.0 zone is the last supportive levels on the way to 5000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6300.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US House Unanimously Passes Bill to Help Fight Illicit Use of Cryptocurrencies 
The U.S. House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill to help prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, including  bitcoin -0.33% , dash, zcash, and monero. This bill follows a testimony by the Secret Service asking Congress for help stopping these activities. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has passed Bill H.R. 6069, known as the “Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act.” 
The bill was considered by the House on Monday, June 25, and “passed unanimously,” according to California Rep. Juan Vargas, the representative who jointly introduced the bill with Rep. Keith Rothfus, announced. 
The Republican Policy Committee website describes: 
“H.R. 6069 would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking. The GAO study would also examine how virtual currencies can be used to detect and deter these illicit activities.” 
Huobi Exchange Suspends Services for Japanese Residents 
Crypto exchange Huobi notified its Japanese customers via e-mail on Wednesday that it will be closing accounts of users who are residents of Japan. According to Huobi, their decision came up as a result of compliance issues with the Japanese law. 
Huobi Pro reportedly plans to remove the Japanese page from its website as of July 2, and stop providing trading services to Japanese residents. Although the announcement is not yet visible on the official company homepage, further details are expected to appear in the coming hours, a Telegram administrator for Huobi said.

The daily range continues to tighten as anticipated in the video last night.  
We can see it with more detail on the 4 hour chart that the bulls need to form a higher low this morning.  
Daily  inside bar  is forming today but a long way to go before the candle closes.  
RSI  line is trending down towards the support line in the tightening pattern.  
The overall trend favors the bears for continuation as it is much easier to continue the trend than it is to go against it and change momentum.  
Anticipating a break of this tightening range within the next 24 hours.  
$5,500 support if we drop to lower lows.

 Bitcoin -0.33%  has once again remained in a consolidation phase and also remains in an oversold territory with a positive  RSI  divergence. Any positive move could resume short-term rally to 6900-7000$ initially.

I don't short  BTC -0.33%  this time because I consider we are too close to a very strong  support level  but I am  bearish  on the short term. 

BTC -0.33%  almost completed the  triangle pattern  and  RSI  shows a  bearish trend .  

I think  BTC -0.33%  will break the triangle with a down trend move to reach a first step at 5800$ in the coming hours/days.

Here we publish signals of the indicator called “Ranger”. It was developed by our experts for intraday trading purposes.  
This indicator is based on statistical analysis of the data and provides information about possible maximum/minimum values of the day (just right after the day has started) with certain probabilities.  
What does this information give to the trader? Actually, a lot. First of all, trading signals. For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability. So, you can open a position opposite to the current movement, knowing in advance that it will be profitable with certain probability.
