Nothing too complicated, just a general point of interest that may provide sufficient support for ETHUSD's next leg higher (at least until it hits  trendline  resistance). This trade setup does not assume a long bias just because the trade direction is ""long"" -- this setup assumes a buy-side broker, i.e. asset purchase through Coinbase / GDAX, etc. without the capability to short an  ETHUSD -1.36% CFD             . 

This one is for those of you who play the Crypto Casino on the weekends. I'm not here to debate the merits of blockchain and a ""fair value"" estimate of ETH in its current environment. I am still  bearish  in CC's until I see more  bullish  behavior in the market. 

I do not own any ETH at this time, but I do have a limit entry set on GDAX for the following trade.
