Now in the market there is a rollback after a long-running down trend. But are there any facts that can show us that further will be  a strong upward movement? Especially, Ripple is relatively weak with respect to other coins. 
I see a good opportunity to get into shorts at 0.54-0.55 $ with global targets of $ 0.37 and $ 0.29. 
The previous idea of ""trouble for investors XRP part 2"" has not worked out yet. But my targets have not changed and there is a big chance to see them.

XRP  head and shoulders  showing on the smaller time frames.  
Previous test of the 1.618 and after being rejected looks as though it will be pulled back into the first fib level (0.0 - 1.0).

					I didn't mention it in the video as I wanted to get it up before the trade executed, but the risk/reward ratio is actually 45/1. Plenty of room for profit here if it takes in the early stages, even if it doesn't quite hit the target.

Why are people fighting this trend? Many people in my Chat room are trying to go long, or claiming that these small percent rises are the new boom... Patience, determination, good charting. Pay attention, the bulls run in the streets at night!

Ripple plays an an important role in the crypto space, and an even more important role within the finance industry in general. Ripples' products serve as an inter-ledger system, connecting crypto and fiat currencies, for easy conversion. As the xCurrent system gets adopted by more and more banks, like Kotak Mahindra for example, Indias largest bank, and as more wallets support XRP just like Wirex will in the next few days, will XRP be the one coin to rule them all?  

The chart tells us there's great support at $0.45 - $0.50 range, but the biggest problem with this coin (for us traders) is that news and other fundamental influences don't do much for this chart. But that is definitely a great sign for the coin itself, when stability is concerned. This is what the banks want to see, is my liquidity going to take a shit if there's a lil bad news floating around, or will it hold up?  

I believe anything under $0.50 will be a great buy for this coin. Hodl more of this long- a couple years long, unload for some profits early on tho. Can we see XRP at a couple bucks again soon? Maybe a Christmas present from Brad Garlinghouse?
