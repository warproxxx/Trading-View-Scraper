1530546786.0,yarr,Ethereum - Where The Price is Heading Next?,"
Ahoy traders, 
here's my long term view on ethereum: 

The Market had strong move upwards from the  support zone  ($400 - $422 levels) and is already breaking above of 0.786 fib level which is good indication of recovery in the process. The chart is showing us  Falling Wedge  pattern and measured target for this pattern is around $660 - $700 levels. Upward movement is also supported by the  bullish divergence  which is known trend reversal pattern. 

Volume  is giving validity to the break out once it happens because without  volume  it has higher chance to fail and push price lower. 

First  resistance zone  is good for taking partial of the profit and it's likely to have minor retrace from that area.  

Please, if any question comes to your mind don’t hesitate to ask! I try my best to respond ASAP!  
If you need help with trading, finding information or courses let me know and I’d be more than happy to help you!

1530541471.0,Quantamize,SEC comments on Blockchain ETF,"
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved plans for public comment which would allow investment companies to bring new ETFs to the market which invest in blockchain companies. The proposed changes indicate that ETFs launches do not need to seek special permission from the SEC if the  ETF  is considered a plain vanilla  ETF .  An exotic  ETF  would come under greater scrutiny if the  ETF  operates with leverage. Speculation has arisen that blockchain based ETFs, those which the constituents are public equities involved in the blockchain space, would be considered a plain vanilla  ETF  and would not face deep scrutiny when proposed. In contrast, proposed ETFs that invest in cryptocurrencies would most likely be challenged by the SEC
