1530688493.0,VARZAR_INVESTMENT,Trading plan: ETHUSD (Ethereum),"
The rate of  Ethereum              does not rush to grow. 
Priority of the day: the growth of  ETHUSD              rate to $ 500. 
Today we stick to our opinion - the growth of  Ethereum              rate should continue. The zone of the beginning of  Ethereum              rate quotation growth: $ 457 - $ 440. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD              rate will rise from $ 457 to $ 500. 
2. The  ETHUSD              may still be in range today. 
An alternative scenario: 
If  Ethereum              rate hits the $ 440 level from the top down, then it's likely to drop to $ 410.
