1530234513.0,awgal,Venturi Yin & Yang Effect - Litecoin,"
Venturi Effect = The Venturi effect is the reduction in fluid pressure that results when a fluid flows through a constricted section of pipe which causes a stronger pressure out flow.  

So as the price starts decreasing and constricting with shorts going crazy, and longs getting rekt... we wont need new money to move this market anymore. The current amount of shorts, longs and fundings that are being used and parked, is still here. Remember trading is just moving money/crypto from one person to another. Someone is still buying and accumulating, someone is still lending their coins, and someone is still longing. This market isn't dead, we are just in a cycle correction, after this cycle we enter a  bullish  new cycle, and that is when new money comes in.  

Yin & Yang = ""Negative and positive"", ""dark and light"", ""shorts and longs"".  

no need to explain this :P.
