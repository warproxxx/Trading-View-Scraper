Bloomberg crypto index has held its ground and managed no to break below previous Feb lows! 
RSI  has broken downtrend resistance for the first time since the failed  UA -3.48%  at 10k. 

Now we watch. I expect another test of the lows before marking up!

On larger scale, Litecoin is in a downtrend, and I would not trade it personally on the long side, but price has found support at significant price Level counted from the top at the 200 day cycle. My Outlook is that price want to retest the 45 line before last leg Down in the corrective structure at the 273 day cycle before some sideways to accumulate before resuming uptrend. 

Good Luck.

The cryptocurrency market is overall long term  bearish  until proven otherwise, but many altcoins are hinting at a possible relief bounce as they approach strong support lines, are near the bottoms of channels, are oversold on the daily  RSI , and playing within reversal patterns (falling  wedges , etc.).  

Here is a quick look at LTC, which has retraced 80% from its all time high.

Short term  bearish  on Litecoin. Will be a buyer in the 40-50 dollar range.
