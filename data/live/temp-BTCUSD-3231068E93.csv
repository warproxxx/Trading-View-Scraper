 Elliott Wave  theorists could make a reasonable case that the correction is over.

This is practically the only chart / forecast you need for  Bitcoin -0.12%  to go through Q3.  Those who follow me would know that this is an update of the same chart which I posted back in July 1 and June 23, except for some fine details.  Why make new a chart when the forecast has been accurate so far, right?  The targets I laid out in the chart are all pro trade targets where others charge you hundreds a year, if not thousands. Here, you get all that for FREE!  The least you can do is give this chart a LIKE!  Sounds fair? 

Good luck, my friends! Happy trading!

 BTC -0.12%  -0.08% has formed a  rising wedge  that has broken above a 2 month long downward column, and is currently consolidating around the .236 retrace of the falling column created during May and June. I have a close up of the subwaves of waves 2 and 3 of the  wedge  in the update below. 

Wave 2 was a WXY. Subwave 3 of 3 was only 1.618 of subwave 1 of 3, making wave 3 significantly smaller than wave 1, from this we can infer the continuation of the  wedge  pattern until completion. I have subwave 5 of 3 matching the length of subwave 3 of 3, making it extend towards the top of the  wedge  . Wave 3 cannot be the smallest, and therefore that forces wave 5 to be the smallest wave. This pattern of decreasing  volume  and price heights of waves 1, 3, and 5, is a common trait of the  rising wedge  . I have wave 4 retracing to the top of 3. I have wave 5 at .5 of wave 1, which as you can see matches exactly with the .382 retrace of the downward column.  

I have the top price of the  wedge  at 7369, which is your sell target on the  wedge  .  

The  rising wedge  , during a bear trend, will break in a continuation of the bear trend. The base of the  wedge  is at 5757. This price is found on the bottom of the candlewick seen on the Bitfinex chart. The base of the candle is up at 5780; this represents the minimum (upper) price target after breaking from the  rising wedge  . I am expecting the price to drop down to any one of the fibonacci extensions less than a 1:1 with the price drop of the column before the  rising wedge  . I use the  fibonacci extension  tool to mark up the price targets on the chart.  

Therefore, I am expecting the  BTC -0.12%  -0.08% price bottom at any price between 3100 and 5780; however, the highest probability is the median (.382, .5, and .618), represented by the ""Buy Zone Target."" It would be wise to cast a buy ladder at each of the fibonacci prices, 5743, 5241, 4739, 4024, and 3113, where the bulk of the buying happens within the median.

I made a video today for this chart - check out the channel to see it drawn live - but it looks like we will have positive energy returning in September. A good time to buy before the market returns!

NO need to explain.  All the major top and bottom moves.  Tune out the noise that happens in between.
