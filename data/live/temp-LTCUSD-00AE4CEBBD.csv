1530264888.0,VARZAR_INVESTMENT,Trading plan: LTCUSD (Litecoin),"
The rate of Litecoin flies into the abyss. 
Priority of the day: LTCUSD -0.70%  rate depreciation to $ 67. 
The bear trend for Litecoin dragged on, there was no good correction upwards, so we do not plan to support its sales today. For us, the  earnings  on bounce of Litecoin rate are more likely than on the continuation of its fall. Therefore, today we are waiting for the best situation. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of  LTCUSD -0.70%  will decrease from $ 73 to $ 67. 
2. The rate of  LTCUSD -0.70%  will take the lateral movement. 
Alternative scenario: 
At the moment, the market is ruled by bears, but we are counting on an alternative plan - the purchase of Litecoin. But before that, we need to see the initiative from buyers of Litecoin, so we expect a bounce of its rate to $ 80. And then, we plan to earn on the growth of Litecoin rate.

1530263419.0,icexch,Litecoin has been sagging under its own weight. Avalanche danger,"
In last review we wrote about Litecoin's downward slide. Since that time, it has continued. The was a little update of the minimum. But it was getting lower and lower steadily. On the chart for almost 6 months we see a gradual decline after the previous rise. This semiannual story looks like giant snow cap sliding down a high mountain under its own weight. The farther away, the greater is the mass of accumulated snow. And the higher is the risk of avalanche in case of strong shock. In order to avoid unpredictable and destructive avalanche in the mountains usually it is caused artificially. The same story in on the market: bears make sharp meltdowns after which rise usually starts. But now there are no meltdowns. Cryptocurrency cap has been growing. The dander of avalanches. 

Support is $ 55. 
Resistance is $ 105. 

Wish you profitable deals!

I think we are at the bottom for LTC. If you have some cash it is a great place to buy. Sadly I am out of cash by now and i cant buy more, which is what usually happens in bear markets :D
