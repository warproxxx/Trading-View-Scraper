Hello traders,  

Been in the crypto space for already 7 months and i feel the learning curve is finally giving its rewards.  

Been working on this one together with jfiedler using  elliot  waves with yesterday after catching the last drop.  

BITFINEX:ETHUSD 0.17%  is reproducing the last  fractal  in a higher scale, right now we are in the final  ABC  before a possible move up to the 505 - 515 range wich should hapen this afternoon/evening.  

You can see also de  MACD  is moving to the upside.  

If you decide to jump in be sure to sell when the upside is done, will be posting more updates on catching wave low point and selling tops.  

I am personally  bullish  on this one, as you usual this is a personal opinion and i am not advising to buy any digital asset, just my opinion.  

Cheers,  

Roberto
