1530740635.0,sunny.labana,July and August XRP Short Term Trends,"
This is my first Analysis.  This is a chart I have been using for a few months. 

Here we go: 

Month of July, (~$0.70 Prediction) 

If the uptrend continues we can see it touching the top of the green  downtrend channel . This is a strong downward resistance that has been pushing us down since February.  If we can break this point and sustain above the  resistance area  of ~$0.70 , it would show good momentum.  However we need  volume  this month for confirmation. 


Month of August, (~$0.20 Prediction) 

If we continue with the same volumes currently we will see a reach to the YELLOW zone in the $0.20 range.  This is the bottom in my eyes.  This would push us into the high 90% correction from  ATH -1.03% . On the bright side we have bounced upward from strong support at around the $0.40 mark. The YELLOW and RED zones will be my buy areas.  There seems to line up towards the October-December timeline. 


Conclusion: 

July and August are months to keep an eye on as we start to close the gap.   Volume  will decide weather we see any gains to be made or in my opinion, it may offer a chance for the lowest entry price point for 2018 @$0.20. 

Any comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
