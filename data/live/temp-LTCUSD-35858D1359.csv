1530836209.0,HodlCrypot,LTC/USD SPOTTED QUADRUPLE ALGO TARGET AT 65 USD,"
Dear HodlCrypots,  

Currently there is some indecision in the market. The spike up of  btc 0.07%  entered a no trade zone (at least for me).  

While I was updating my chart for LTC I noticed a sweet algo target that had four (!) algo targets set between 64 and 66 usd. Either this is a huge coincedence or it must be an important  pivot  in the chart where going long is a nice trade.  

In the case of the wave count we notice that the last wave of 5 is still a possibility in my primary count.  

When we look at the  volume  we notice that there is a horizontal line at the buy zone and an increasing pattern in the sell zone.  

We also (and ofcourse this is preliminary) notice that the  rsi  showed a moment of weakness in the  daily chart  when an important resistance line was reached. In the case of a (follow up of)  bullish divergence  on the  rsi  in the 4h chart this would mean a lower low and where our  elliot  count will be probably completed at the  pivot  where our algo targets are.  

Furthermore the  MACD  4C is still in the red which means it might not be over yet, which increases the chances of hitting the algo targets. This ofcourse is completely dependant on the movement of  btc 0.07% .  

It's just an idea and when this idea actualy takes form expect a nice bounce from it because it will be an extremely technical play.  

Thanks for taking your time to read this!  

Stay safe and good luck everyone!
