There has been a lot of conversation about  BTCUSD -0.66%  and the Longs approaching a high level so I thought I would look at the short history of  BTCUSD Longs 1.30%  on Bitfinex and see if there is anything we can glean.  This isn’t a full academic study but my first impressions looking at the data. 

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD -0.66% .  My two main thoughts are a lot of people opened positions with extreme leverage in their enthusiasm, completely consumed with FOMO and the idea that  BTCUSD -0.66%  can only go up and they got liquidated by a relatively small change in price. 

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss. 

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

",,19,0,1
1530607284.0,PNUTTY,"Bitcoin Showing Some Strength, But Too Soon for Dec 2017 Revival","
By now most  Bitcoin -0.67%  hodlers and enthusiasts would be well aware of the previous  Bitcoin -0.67%  price surges and the price corrections that follow. The 2014 price surge experienced a correction close to the price where the surge began (0.786–1 retrace), and was followed by a pro-longed period of relatively boring price action as can be seen in the graph above. 

With this in mind many hodlers have come to accept that time and patience are crucial ingredients for what they hope would be the next trip to the moon. The questions on everyone’s minds are now simply: 
 - What is the bottom? 6k is showing some strength though 3k would be what many traders shorting  bitcoin -0.67%  would project. 
 - When will the trip to the moon arrive? The 2014 recovery suggests years of relatively boring price movement. 

6k vs 3k Bottom 

Bearish  traders would be waiting to see  Bitcoin -0.67%  fulfill historic price patterns and correct close to the 3k price level. However  Bitcoin -0.67%  has shown some signs of strength since it’s fall from 20k. The first sign was the breaking out from the strong downward  trend line  formed from the 20k and 17k peaks which went from resistance to support line. 






The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin -0.67%  price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin -0.67%  fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash -0.45% . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

I'm looking at the possibility of a  rising wedge  here and have taken profits on alts and opened small short positions.  

If it breaks I will stop out otherwise we could revisit the 6200 area and retest the support of the old bear resistance TL.  Timeframe looks like the next 24 hours for confirmation.   

Irrespectively there's a nice bottoming out feeling for  BTC -0.67%  0.32% here and feeling confident of staying above $6k although not quite bull (yet). I'm trading both ways in small scalps where opportunities present themselves.  

Happy trading and good luck!

The 2014 price surge experienced a correction close to the price where the surge began (0.786–1 retrace), and was followed by a pro-longed period of relatively boring price action as can be seen in the graph above. 

With this in mind many hodlers have come to accept that time and patience are crucial ingredients for what they hope would be the next trip to the moon. The questions on everyone’s minds are now simply: 
 - What is the bottom? 6k is showing some strength though 3k would be what many traders shorting  bitcoin              would project. 
 - When will the trip to the moon arrive? The 2014 recovery suggests years of relatively boring price movement. 

6k vs 3k Bottom 

Bearish  traders would be waiting to see  Bitcoin              fulfill historic price patterns and correct close to the 3k price level. However  Bitcoin              has shown some signs of strength since it’s fall from 20k. The first sign was the breaking out from the strong downward  trend line  formed from the 20k and 17k peaks which went from resistance to support line. 






The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin              price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin              fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash             . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

There has been a lot of conversation about  BTCUSD              and the Longs approaching a high level so I thought I would look at the short history of  BTCUSD Longs              on Bitfinex and see if there is anything we can glean.  This isn’t a full academic study but my first impressions looking at the data. 

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD             .  My two main thoughts are a lot of people opened positions with extreme leverage in their enthusiasm, completely consumed with FOMO and the idea that  BTCUSD              can only go up and they got liquidated by a relatively small change in price. 

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss. 

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin -0.67%  fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash -0.45% . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

There has been a lot of conversation about  BTCUSD -0.73%  and the Longs approaching a high level so I thought I would look at the short history of  BTCUSD Longs 1.28%  on Bitfinex and see if there is anything we can glean.  This isn’t a full academic study but my first impressions looking at the data. 

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD -0.73% .  My two main thoughts are a lot of people opened positions with extreme leverage in their enthusiasm, completely consumed with FOMO and the idea that  BTCUSD -0.73%  can only go up and they got liquidated by a relatively small change in price. 

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss. 

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

",,19,0,1
1530607284.0,PNUTTY,"Bitcoin Showing Some Strength, But Too Soon for Dec 2017 Revival","
By now most  Bitcoin -0.73%  hodlers and enthusiasts would be well aware of the previous  Bitcoin -0.73%  price surges and the price corrections that follow. The 2014 price surge experienced a correction close to the price where the surge began (0.786–1 retrace), and was followed by a pro-longed period of relatively boring price action as can be seen in the graph above. 

With this in mind many hodlers have come to accept that time and patience are crucial ingredients for what they hope would be the next trip to the moon. The questions on everyone’s minds are now simply: 
 - What is the bottom? 6k is showing some strength though 3k would be what many traders shorting  bitcoin -0.73%  would project. 
 - When will the trip to the moon arrive? The 2014 recovery suggests years of relatively boring price movement. 

6k vs 3k Bottom 

Bearish  traders would be waiting to see  Bitcoin -0.73%  fulfill historic price patterns and correct close to the 3k price level. However  Bitcoin -0.73%  has shown some signs of strength since it’s fall from 20k. The first sign was the breaking out from the strong downward  trend line  formed from the 20k and 17k peaks which went from resistance to support line. 






The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin -0.73%  price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin -0.73%  fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash -0.45% . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

I'm looking at the possibility of a  rising wedge  here and have taken profits on alts and opened small short positions.  

If it breaks I will stop out otherwise we could revisit the 6200 area and retest the support of the old bear resistance TL.  Timeframe looks like the next 24 hours for confirmation.   

Irrespectively there's a nice bottoming out feeling for  BTC -0.73%  0.32% here and feeling confident of staying above $6k although not quite bull (yet). I'm trading both ways in small scalps where opportunities present themselves.  

Happy trading and good luck!

The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin -0.73%  price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin -0.73%  fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash -0.45% . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

1530606747.0,This_Guhy,BTCUSD and BTCUSD Long Squeeze and still bearish,"
There has been a lot of conversation about  BTCUSD -0.73%  and the Longs approaching a high level so I thought I would look at the short history of  BTCUSD Longs 1.28%  on Bitfinex and see if there is anything we can glean.  This isn’t a full academic study but my first impressions looking at the data. 

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD -0.73% .  My two main thoughts are a lot of people opened positions with extreme leverage in their enthusiasm, completely consumed with FOMO and the idea that  BTCUSD -0.73%  can only go up and they got liquidated by a relatively small change in price. 

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss. 

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

1530607284.0,PNUTTY,"Bitcoin Showing Some Strength, But Too Soon for Dec 2017 Revival","
By now most  Bitcoin -0.73%  hodlers and enthusiasts would be well aware of the previous  Bitcoin -0.73%  price surges and the price corrections that follow. The 2014 price surge experienced a correction close to the price where the surge began (0.786–1 retrace), and was followed by a pro-longed period of relatively boring price action as can be seen in the graph above. 

With this in mind many hodlers have come to accept that time and patience are crucial ingredients for what they hope would be the next trip to the moon. The questions on everyone’s minds are now simply: 
 - What is the bottom? 6k is showing some strength though 3k would be what many traders shorting  bitcoin -0.73%  would project. 
 - When will the trip to the moon arrive? The 2014 recovery suggests years of relatively boring price movement. 

6k vs 3k Bottom 

Bearish  traders would be waiting to see  Bitcoin -0.73%  fulfill historic price patterns and correct close to the 3k price level. However  Bitcoin -0.73%  has shown some signs of strength since it’s fall from 20k. The first sign was the breaking out from the strong downward  trend line  formed from the 20k and 17k peaks which went from resistance to support line. 






The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin -0.73%  price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin -0.73%  fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash             . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

There has been a lot of conversation about  BTCUSD              and the Longs approaching a high level so I thought I would look at the short history of  BTCUSD Longs              on Bitfinex and see if there is anything we can glean.  This isn’t a full academic study but my first impressions looking at the data. 

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD             .  My two main thoughts are a lot of people opened positions with extreme leverage in their enthusiasm, completely consumed with FOMO and the idea that  BTCUSD              can only go up and they got liquidated by a relatively small change in price. 

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss. 

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

1530607284.0,PNUTTY,"Bitcoin Showing Some Strength, But Too Soon for Dec 2017 Revival","
By now most  Bitcoin              hodlers and enthusiasts would be well aware of the previous  Bitcoin              price surges and the price corrections that follow. The 2014 price surge experienced a correction close to the price where the surge began (0.786–1 retrace), and was followed by a pro-longed period of relatively boring price action as can be seen in the graph above. 

With this in mind many hodlers have come to accept that time and patience are crucial ingredients for what they hope would be the next trip to the moon. The questions on everyone’s minds are now simply: 
 - What is the bottom? 6k is showing some strength though 3k would be what many traders shorting  bitcoin              would project. 
 - When will the trip to the moon arrive? The 2014 recovery suggests years of relatively boring price movement. 

6k vs 3k Bottom 

Bearish  traders would be waiting to see  Bitcoin              fulfill historic price patterns and correct close to the 3k price level. However  Bitcoin              has shown some signs of strength since it’s fall from 20k. The first sign was the breaking out from the strong downward  trend line  formed from the 20k and 17k peaks which went from resistance to support line. 






The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin              price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin              fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash             . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

I'm looking at the possibility of a  rising wedge  here and have taken profits on alts and opened small short positions.  

If it breaks I will stop out otherwise we could revisit the 6200 area and retest the support of the old bear resistance TL.  Timeframe looks like the next 24 hours for confirmation.   

Irrespectively there's a nice bottoming out feeling for  BTC -0.73%  0.32% here and feeling confident of staying above $6k although not quite bull (yet). I'm trading both ways in small scalps where opportunities present themselves.  

Happy trading and good luck!

There has been a lot of conversation about  BTCUSD              and the Longs approaching a high level so I thought I would look at the short history of  BTCUSD Longs              on Bitfinex and see if there is anything we can glean.

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD             .

Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later.

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

1530606747.0,This_Guhy,BTCUSD and BTCUSD Long Squeeze and still bearish,"
There has been a lot of conversation about  BTCUSD              and the Longs approaching a high level so I thought I would look at the short history of  BTCUSD Longs              on Bitfinex and see if there is anything we can glean.  This isn’t a full academic study but my first impressions looking at the data. 

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD             .  My two main thoughts are a lot of people opened positions with extreme leverage in their enthusiasm, completely consumed with FOMO and the idea that  BTCUSD              can only go up and they got liquidated by a relatively small change in price. 

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss. 

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

1530607284.0,PNUTTY,"Bitcoin Showing Some Strength, But Too Soon for Dec 2017 Revival","
By now most  Bitcoin              hodlers and enthusiasts would be well aware of the previous  Bitcoin              price surges and the price corrections that follow. The 2014 price surge experienced a correction close to the price where the surge began (0.786–1 retrace), and was followed by a pro-longed period of relatively boring price action as can be seen in the graph above. 

With this in mind many hodlers have come to accept that time and patience are crucial ingredients for what they hope would be the next trip to the moon. The questions on everyone’s minds are now simply: 
 - What is the bottom? 6k is showing some strength though 3k would be what many traders shorting  bitcoin              would project. 
 - When will the trip to the moon arrive? The 2014 recovery suggests years of relatively boring price movement. 

6k vs 3k Bottom 

Bearish  traders would be waiting to see  Bitcoin              fulfill historic price patterns and correct close to the 3k price level. However  Bitcoin              has shown some signs of strength since it’s fall from 20k. The first sign was the breaking out from the strong downward  trend line  formed from the 20k and 17k peaks which went from resistance to support line. 






The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin              price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin              fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash             . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

1530607284.0,PNUTTY,"Bitcoin Showing Some Strength, But Too Soon for Dec 2017 Revival","
By now most  Bitcoin -0.81%  hodlers and enthusiasts would be well aware of the previous  Bitcoin -0.81%  price surges and the price corrections that follow. The 2014 price surge experienced a correction close to the price where the surge began (0.786–1 retrace), and was followed by a pro-longed period of relatively boring price action as can be seen in the graph above. 

With this in mind many hodlers have come to accept that time and patience are crucial ingredients for what they hope would be the next trip to the moon. The questions on everyone’s minds are now simply: 
 - What is the bottom? 6k is showing some strength though 3k would be what many traders shorting  bitcoin -0.81%  would project. 
 - When will the trip to the moon arrive? The 2014 recovery suggests years of relatively boring price movement. 

6k vs 3k Bottom 

Bearish  traders would be waiting to see  Bitcoin -0.81%  fulfill historic price patterns and correct close to the 3k price level. However  Bitcoin -0.81%  has shown some signs of strength since it’s fall from 20k. The first sign was the breaking out from the strong downward  trend line  formed from the 20k and 17k peaks which went from resistance to support line. 






The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin -0.81%  price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin -0.81%  fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash -0.52% . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

I'm looking at the possibility of a  rising wedge  here and have taken profits on alts and opened small short positions.  

If it breaks I will stop out otherwise we could revisit the 6200 area and retest the support of the old bear resistance TL.  Timeframe looks like the next 24 hours for confirmation.   

Irrespectively there's a nice bottoming out feeling for  BTC -0.81%  0.32% here and feeling confident of staying above $6k although not quite bull (yet). I'm trading both ways in small scalps where opportunities present themselves.  

Happy trading and good luck!

There has been a lot of conversation about  BTCUSD -0.81%  and the Longs approaching a high level so I thought I would look at the short history of  BTCUSD Longs 1.26%  on Bitfinex and see if there is anything we can glean.  This isn’t a full academic study but my first impressions looking at the data. 

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD -0.81% .  My two main thoughts are a lot of people opened positions with extreme leverage in their enthusiasm, completely consumed with FOMO and the idea that  BTCUSD -0.81%  can only go up and they got liquidated by a relatively small change in price. 

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss. 

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down.

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

There has been a lot of conversation about  BTCUSD -0.83%  and the Longs approaching a high level so I thought I would look at the short history of  BTCUSD Longs 1.26%  on Bitfinex and see if there is anything we can glean.  This isn’t a full academic study but my first impressions looking at the data. 

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD -0.83% .  My two main thoughts are a lot of people opened positions with extreme leverage in their enthusiasm, completely consumed with FOMO and the idea that  BTCUSD -0.83%  can only go up and they got liquidated by a relatively small change in price. 

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss. 

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

1530607284.0,PNUTTY,"Bitcoin Showing Some Strength, But Too Soon for Dec 2017 Revival","
By now most  Bitcoin              hodlers and enthusiasts would be well aware of the previous  Bitcoin              price surges and the price corrections that follow. The 2014 price surge experienced a correction close to the price where the surge began (0.786–1 retrace), and was followed by a pro-longed period of relatively boring price action as can be seen in the graph above. 

With this in mind many hodlers have come to accept that time and patience are crucial ingredients for what they hope would be the next trip to the moon. The questions on everyone’s minds are now simply: 
 - What is the bottom? 6k is showing some strength though 3k would be what many traders shorting  bitcoin              would project. 
 - When will the trip to the moon arrive? The 2014 recovery suggests years of relatively boring price movement. 

6k vs 3k Bottom 

Bearish  traders would be waiting to see  Bitcoin              fulfill historic price patterns and correct close to the 3k price level. However  Bitcoin              has shown some signs of strength since it’s fall from 20k. The first sign was the breaking out from the strong downward  trend line  formed from the 20k and 17k peaks which went from resistance to support line. 






The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin              price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin              fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash             . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

1530607284.0,PNUTTY,"Bitcoin Showing Some Strength, But Too Soon for Dec 2017 Revival","
By now most  Bitcoin -0.83%  hodlers and enthusiasts would be well aware of the previous  Bitcoin -0.83%  price surges and the price corrections that follow. The 2014 price surge experienced a correction close to the price where the surge began (0.786–1 retrace), and was followed by a pro-longed period of relatively boring price action as can be seen in the graph above. 

With this in mind many hodlers have come to accept that time and patience are crucial ingredients for what they hope would be the next trip to the moon. The questions on everyone’s minds are now simply: 
 - What is the bottom? 6k is showing some strength though 3k would be what many traders shorting  bitcoin -0.83%  would project. 
 - When will the trip to the moon arrive? The 2014 recovery suggests years of relatively boring price movement. 

6k vs 3k Bottom 

Bearish  traders would be waiting to see  Bitcoin -0.83%  fulfill historic price patterns and correct close to the 3k price level. However  Bitcoin -0.83%  has shown some signs of strength since it’s fall from 20k. The first sign was the breaking out from the strong downward  trend line  formed from the 20k and 17k peaks which went from resistance to support line. 






The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin -0.83%  price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin -0.83%  fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash -0.64% . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

I'm looking at the possibility of a  rising wedge  here and have taken profits on alts and opened small short positions.  

If it breaks I will stop out otherwise we could revisit the 6200 area and retest the support of the old bear resistance TL.  Timeframe looks like the next 24 hours for confirmation.   

Irrespectively there's a nice bottoming out feeling for  BTC -0.83%  0.32% here and feeling confident of staying above $6k although not quite bull (yet). I'm trading both ways in small scalps where opportunities present themselves.  

Happy trading and good luck!

There has been a lot of conversation about  BTCUSD -0.83%  and the Longs approaching a high level so I thought I would look at the short history of  BTCUSD Longs 1.25%  on Bitfinex and see if there is anything we can glean.  This isn’t a full academic study but my first impressions looking at the data. 

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD -0.83% .  My two main thoughts are a lot of people opened positions with extreme leverage in their enthusiasm, completely consumed with FOMO and the idea that  BTCUSD -0.83%  can only go up and they got liquidated by a relatively small change in price. 

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss. 

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

If it breaks I will stop out otherwise we could revisit the 6200 area and retest the support of the old bear resistance TL.  Timeframe looks like the next 24 hours for confirmation.   

Irrespectively there's a nice bottoming out feeling for  BTC -0.83%  0.32% here and feeling confident of staying above $6k although not quite bull (yet). I'm trading both ways in small scalps where opportunities present themselves.  

Happy trading and good luck!

There has been a lot of conversation about  BTCUSD              and the Longs approaching a high level so I thought I would look at the short history of  BTCUSD Longs              on Bitfinex and see if there is anything we can glean.  This isn’t a full academic study but my first impressions looking at the data. 

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD             .  My two main thoughts are a lot of people opened positions with extreme leverage in their enthusiasm, completely consumed with FOMO and the idea that  BTCUSD              can only go up and they got liquidated by a relatively small change in price. 

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss. 

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

1530607284.0,PNUTTY,"Bitcoin Showing Some Strength, But Too Soon for Dec 2017 Revival","
By now most  Bitcoin              hodlers and enthusiasts would be well aware of the previous  Bitcoin              price surges and the price corrections that follow. The 2014 price surge experienced a correction close to the price where the surge began (0.786–1 retrace), and was followed by a pro-longed period of relatively boring price action as can be seen in the graph above. 

With this in mind many hodlers have come to accept that time and patience are crucial ingredients for what they hope would be the next trip to the moon. The questions on everyone’s minds are now simply: 
 - What is the bottom? 6k is showing some strength though 3k would be what many traders shorting  bitcoin              would project. 
 - When will the trip to the moon arrive? The 2014 recovery suggests years of relatively boring price movement. 

6k vs 3k Bottom 

Bearish  traders would be waiting to see  Bitcoin              fulfill historic price patterns and correct close to the 3k price level. However  Bitcoin              has shown some signs of strength since it’s fall from 20k. The first sign was the breaking out from the strong downward  trend line  formed from the 20k and 17k peaks which went from resistance to support line. 






The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin              price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin              fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash             . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

By now most  Bitcoin              hodlers and enthusiasts would be well aware of the previous  Bitcoin              price surges and the price corrections that follow. The 2014 price surge experienced a correction close to the price where the surge began (0.786–1 retrace), and was followed by a pro-longed period of relatively boring price action as can be seen in the graph above. 

With this in mind many hodlers have come to accept that time and patience are crucial ingredients for what they hope would be the next trip to the moon. The questions on everyone’s minds are now simply: 
 - What is the bottom? 6k is showing some strength though 3k would be what many traders shorting  bitcoin              would project. 
 - When will the trip to the moon arrive? The 2014 recovery suggests years of relatively boring price movement. 

6k vs 3k Bottom 

Bearish  traders would be waiting to see  Bitcoin              fulfill historic price patterns and correct close to the 3k price level. However  Bitcoin              has shown some signs of strength since it’s fall from 20k. The first sign was the breaking out from the strong downward  trend line  formed from the 20k and 17k peaks which went from resistance to support line. 






The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin              price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin              fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash             . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

There has been a lot of conversation about  BTCUSD -0.82%  and the Longs approaching a high level so I thought I would look at the short history of  BTCUSD Longs 1.26%  on Bitfinex and see if there is anything we can glean.  This isn’t a full academic study but my first impressions looking at the data. 

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD -0.82% .  My two main thoughts are a lot of people opened positions with extreme leverage in their enthusiasm, completely consumed with FOMO and the idea that  BTCUSD -0.82%  can only go up and they got liquidated by a relatively small change in price. 

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss. 

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

There has been a lot of conversation about  BTCUSD -0.75%  and the Longs approaching a high level so I thought I would look at the short history of  BTCUSD Longs 1.26%  on Bitfinex and see if there is anything we can glean.  This isn’t a full academic study but my first impressions looking at the data. 

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD -0.75% .  My two main thoughts are a lot of people opened positions with extreme leverage in their enthusiasm, completely consumed with FOMO and the idea that  BTCUSD -0.75%  can only go up and they got liquidated by a relatively small change in price. 

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss. 

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

",,19,0,1
1530607284.0,PNUTTY,"Bitcoin Showing Some Strength, But Too Soon for Dec 2017 Revival","
By now most  Bitcoin -0.75%  hodlers and enthusiasts would be well aware of the previous  Bitcoin -0.75%  price surges and the price corrections that follow. The 2014 price surge experienced a correction close to the price where the surge began (0.786–1 retrace), and was followed by a pro-longed period of relatively boring price action as can be seen in the graph above. 

With this in mind many hodlers have come to accept that time and patience are crucial ingredients for what they hope would be the next trip to the moon. The questions on everyone’s minds are now simply: 
 - What is the bottom? 6k is showing some strength though 3k would be what many traders shorting  bitcoin -0.75%  would project. 
 - When will the trip to the moon arrive? The 2014 recovery suggests years of relatively boring price movement. 

6k vs 3k Bottom 

Bearish  traders would be waiting to see  Bitcoin -0.75%  fulfill historic price patterns and correct close to the 3k price level. However  Bitcoin -0.75%  has shown some signs of strength since it’s fall from 20k. The first sign was the breaking out from the strong downward  trend line  formed from the 20k and 17k peaks which went from resistance to support line. 






The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin -0.75%  price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin -0.75%  fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash -0.45% . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

I'm looking at the possibility of a  rising wedge  here and have taken profits on alts and opened small short positions.  

If it breaks I will stop out otherwise we could revisit the 6200 area and retest the support of the old bear resistance TL.  Timeframe looks like the next 24 hours for confirmation.   

Irrespectively there's a nice bottoming out feeling for  BTC -0.75%  0.32% here and feeling confident of staying above $6k although not quite bull (yet). I'm trading both ways in small scalps where opportunities present themselves.

By now most  Bitcoin -0.67%  hodlers and enthusiasts would be well aware of the previous  Bitcoin -0.67%  price surges and the price corrections that follow. The 2014 price surge experienced a correction close to the price where the surge began (0.786–1 retrace), and was followed by a pro-longed period of relatively boring price action as can be seen in the graph above. 

With this in mind many hodlers have come to accept that time and patience are crucial ingredients for what they hope would be the next trip to the moon. The questions on everyone’s minds are now simply: 
 - What is the bottom? 6k is showing some strength though 3k would be what many traders shorting  bitcoin -0.67%  would project. 
 - When will the trip to the moon arrive? The 2014 recovery suggests years of relatively boring price movement. 

6k vs 3k Bottom 

Bearish  traders would be waiting to see  Bitcoin -0.67%  fulfill historic price patterns and correct close to the 3k price level. However  Bitcoin -0.67%  has shown some signs of strength since it’s fall from 20k. The first sign was the breaking out from the strong downward  trend line  formed from the 20k and 17k peaks which went from resistance to support line. 






The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin -0.67%  price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin -0.67%  fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash 0.03% . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

1530606747.0,This_Guhy,BTCUSD and BTCUSD Long Squeeze and still bearish,"
There has been a lot of conversation about  BTCUSD -0.58%  and the Longs approaching a high level so I thought I would look at the short history of  BTCUSD Longs 1.39%  on Bitfinex and see if there is anything we can glean.  This isn’t a full academic study but my first impressions looking at the data. 

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD -0.58% .  My two main thoughts are a lot of people opened positions with extreme leverage in their enthusiasm, completely consumed with FOMO and the idea that  BTCUSD -0.58%  can only go up and they got liquidated by a relatively small change in price. 

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss. 

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin -0.51%  fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash 0.24% . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes.

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

There has been a lot of conversation about  BTCUSD -0.58%  and the Longs approaching a high level so I thought I would look at the short history of  BTCUSD Longs 1.46%  on Bitfinex and see if there is anything we can glean.  This isn’t a full academic study but my first impressions looking at the data. 

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD -0.58% .  My two main thoughts are a lot of people opened positions with extreme leverage in their enthusiasm, completely consumed with FOMO and the idea that  BTCUSD -0.58%  can only go up and they got liquidated by a relatively small change in price. 

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss. 

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

1530607284.0,PNUTTY,"Bitcoin Showing Some Strength, But Too Soon for Dec 2017 Revival","
By now most  Bitcoin              hodlers and enthusiasts would be well aware of the previous  Bitcoin              price surges and the price corrections that follow. The 2014 price surge experienced a correction close to the price where the surge began (0.786–1 retrace), and was followed by a pro-longed period of relatively boring price action as can be seen in the graph above. 

With this in mind many hodlers have come to accept that time and patience are crucial ingredients for what they hope would be the next trip to the moon. The questions on everyone’s minds are now simply: 
 - What is the bottom? 6k is showing some strength though 3k would be what many traders shorting  bitcoin              would project. 
 - When will the trip to the moon arrive? The 2014 recovery suggests years of relatively boring price movement. 

6k vs 3k Bottom 

Bearish  traders would be waiting to see  Bitcoin              fulfill historic price patterns and correct close to the 3k price level. However  Bitcoin              has shown some signs of strength since it’s fall from 20k. The first sign was the breaking out from the strong downward  trend line  formed from the 20k and 17k peaks which went from resistance to support line. 






The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin              price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin              fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash             . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

I'm looking at the possibility of a  rising wedge  here and have taken profits on alts and opened small short positions.  

If it breaks I will stop out otherwise we could revisit the 6200 area and retest the support of the old bear resistance TL.  Timeframe looks like the next 24 hours for confirmation.   

Irrespectively there's a nice bottoming out feeling for  BTC -0.58%  0.32% here and feeling confident of staying above $6k although not quite bull (yet). I'm trading both ways in small scalps where opportunities present themselves.

 - What is the bottom? 6k is showing some strength though 3k would be what many traders shorting  bitcoin -0.58%  would project. 
 - When will the trip to the moon arrive? The 2014 recovery suggests years of relatively boring price movement. 

6k vs 3k Bottom 

Bearish  traders would be waiting to see  Bitcoin -0.58%  fulfill historic price patterns and correct close to the 3k price level. However  Bitcoin -0.58%  has shown some signs of strength since it’s fall from 20k. The first sign was the breaking out from the strong downward  trend line  formed from the 20k and 17k peaks which went from resistance to support line. 






The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin -0.58%  price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin -0.58%  fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash 0.23% . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

1530606747.0,This_Guhy,BTCUSD and BTCUSD Long Squeeze and still bearish,"
There has been a lot of conversation about  BTCUSD -0.58%  and the Longs approaching a high level so I thought I would look at the short history of  BTCUSD Longs 1.46%  on Bitfinex and see if there is anything we can glean.  This isn’t a full academic study but my first impressions looking at the data. 

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD -0.58% .  My two main thoughts are a lot of people opened positions with extreme leverage in their enthusiasm, completely consumed with FOMO and the idea that  BTCUSD -0.58%  can only go up and they got liquidated by a relatively small change in price. 

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss. 

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

By now most  Bitcoin -0.58%  hodlers and enthusiasts would be well aware of the previous  Bitcoin -0.58%  price surges and the price corrections that follow. The 2014 price surge experienced a correction close to the price where the surge began (0.786–1 retrace), and was followed by a pro-longed period of relatively boring price action as can be seen in the graph above. 

With this in mind many hodlers have come to accept that time and patience are crucial ingredients for what they hope would be the next trip to the moon. The questions on everyone’s minds are now simply:

With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin -0.58%  fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash 0.20% . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

There has been a lot of conversation about  BTCUSD -0.58%  and the Longs approaching a high level so I thought I would look at the short history of  BTCUSD Longs 1.46%  on Bitfinex and see if there is anything we can glean.  This isn’t a full academic study but my first impressions looking at the data. 

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD -0.58% .  My two main thoughts are a lot of people opened positions with extreme leverage in their enthusiasm, completely consumed with FOMO and the idea that  BTCUSD -0.58%  can only go up and they got liquidated by a relatively small change in price. 

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss. 

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

 BTCUSD -0.58%  has clearly broken the  descending channel  now. Next to watch is the  supply level  around 6800. 
",,19,0,1
1530607284.0,PNUTTY,"Bitcoin Showing Some Strength, But Too Soon for Dec 2017 Revival","
By now most  Bitcoin -0.58%  hodlers and enthusiasts would be well aware of the previous  Bitcoin -0.58%  price surges and the price corrections that follow. The 2014 price surge experienced a correction close to the price where the surge began (0.786–1 retrace), and was followed by a pro-longed period of relatively boring price action as can be seen in the graph above. 

With this in mind many hodlers have come to accept that time and patience are crucial ingredients for what they hope would be the next trip to the moon. The questions on everyone’s minds are now simply: 
 - What is the bottom? 6k is showing some strength though 3k would be what many traders shorting  bitcoin -0.58%  would project. 
 - When will the trip to the moon arrive? The 2014 recovery suggests years of relatively boring price movement. 

6k vs 3k Bottom 

Bearish  traders would be waiting to see  Bitcoin -0.58%  fulfill historic price patterns and correct close to the 3k price level. However  Bitcoin -0.58%  has shown some signs of strength since it’s fall from 20k. The first sign was the breaking out from the strong downward  trend line  formed from the 20k and 17k peaks which went from resistance to support line. 






The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin -0.58%  price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin -0.58%  fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash 0.22% . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

I'm looking at the possibility of a  rising wedge  here and have taken profits on alts and opened small short positions.  

If it breaks I will stop out otherwise we could revisit the 6200 area and retest the support of the old bear resistance TL.  Timeframe looks like the next 24 hours for confirmation.   

Irrespectively there's a nice bottoming out feeling for  BTC -0.58%  0.32% here and feeling confident of staying above $6k although not quite bull (yet). I'm trading both ways in small scalps where opportunities present themselves.  

Happy trading and good luck!

The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin -0.58%  fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash 0.22% . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

There has been a lot of conversation about  BTCUSD              and the Longs approaching a high level so I thought I would look at the short history of  BTCUSD Longs              on Bitfinex and see if there is anything we can glean.  This isn’t a full academic study but my first impressions looking at the data. 

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD             .  My two main thoughts are a lot of people opened positions with extreme leverage in their enthusiasm, completely consumed with FOMO and the idea that  BTCUSD              can only go up and they got liquidated by a relatively small change in price. 

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss. 

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

1530607284.0,PNUTTY,"Bitcoin Showing Some Strength, But Too Soon for Dec 2017 Revival","
By now most  Bitcoin -0.58%  hodlers and enthusiasts would be well aware of the previous  Bitcoin -0.58%  price surges and the price corrections that follow. The 2014 price surge experienced a correction close to the price where the surge began (0.786–1 retrace), and was followed by a pro-longed period of relatively boring price action as can be seen in the graph above. 

With this in mind many hodlers have come to accept that time and patience are crucial ingredients for what they hope would be the next trip to the moon. The questions on everyone’s minds are now simply: 
 - What is the bottom? 6k is showing some strength though 3k would be what many traders shorting  bitcoin -0.58%  would project. 
 - When will the trip to the moon arrive? The 2014 recovery suggests years of relatively boring price movement. 

6k vs 3k Bottom 

Bearish  traders would be waiting to see  Bitcoin -0.58%  fulfill historic price patterns and correct close to the 3k price level. However  Bitcoin -0.58%  has shown some signs of strength since it’s fall from 20k. The first sign was the breaking out from the strong downward  trend line  formed from the 20k and 17k peaks which went from resistance to support line. 






The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin -0.58%  price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin -0.58%  fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash 0.23% . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

This isn’t a full academic study but my first impressions looking at the data. 

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD -0.39% .  My two main thoughts are a lot of people opened positions with extreme leverage in their enthusiasm, completely consumed with FOMO and the idea that  BTCUSD -0.39%  can only go up and they got liquidated by a relatively small change in price. 

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss. 

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

",,19,0,1
1530607284.0,PNUTTY,"Bitcoin Showing Some Strength, But Too Soon for Dec 2017 Revival","
By now most  Bitcoin -0.39%  hodlers and enthusiasts would be well aware of the previous  Bitcoin -0.39%  price surges and the price corrections that follow. The 2014 price surge experienced a correction close to the price where the surge began (0.786–1 retrace), and was followed by a pro-longed period of relatively boring price action as can be seen in the graph above. 

With this in mind many hodlers have come to accept that time and patience are crucial ingredients for what they hope would be the next trip to the moon. The questions on everyone’s minds are now simply: 
 - What is the bottom? 6k is showing some strength though 3k would be what many traders shorting  bitcoin -0.39%  would project. 
 - When will the trip to the moon arrive? The 2014 recovery suggests years of relatively boring price movement. 

6k vs 3k Bottom 

Bearish  traders would be waiting to see  Bitcoin -0.39%  fulfill historic price patterns and correct close to the 3k price level. However  Bitcoin -0.39%  has shown some signs of strength since it’s fall from 20k. The first sign was the breaking out from the strong downward  trend line  formed from the 20k and 17k peaks which went from resistance to support line. 






The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin -0.39%  price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin -0.39%  fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash 0.23% . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

I'm looking at the possibility of a  rising wedge  here and have taken profits on alts and opened small short positions.  

If it breaks I will stop out otherwise we could revisit the 6200 area and retest the support of the old bear resistance TL.  Timeframe looks like the next 24 hours for confirmation.   

Irrespectively there's a nice bottoming out feeling for  BTC -0.39%  0.32% here and feeling confident of staying above $6k although not quite bull (yet). I'm trading both ways in small scalps where opportunities present themselves.

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

1530606747.0,This_Guhy,BTCUSD and BTCUSD Long Squeeze and still bearish,"
There has been a lot of conversation about  BTCUSD              and the Longs approaching a high level so I thought I would look at the short history of  BTCUSD Longs              on Bitfinex and see if there is anything we can glean.  This isn’t a full academic study but my first impressions looking at the data. 

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD             .  My two main thoughts are a lot of people opened positions with extreme leverage in their enthusiasm, completely consumed with FOMO and the idea that  BTCUSD              can only go up and they got liquidated by a relatively small change in price. 

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss. 

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

 BTCUSD -0.42%  has clearly broken the  descending channel  now. Next to watch is the  supply level  around 6800. 
",,19,0,1
1530607284.0,PNUTTY,"Bitcoin Showing Some Strength, But Too Soon for Dec 2017 Revival","
By now most  Bitcoin -0.42%  hodlers and enthusiasts would be well aware of the previous  Bitcoin -0.42%  price surges and the price corrections that follow. The 2014 price surge experienced a correction close to the price where the surge began (0.786–1 retrace), and was followed by a pro-longed period of relatively boring price action as can be seen in the graph above. 

With this in mind many hodlers have come to accept that time and patience are crucial ingredients for what they hope would be the next trip to the moon. The questions on everyone’s minds are now simply: 
 - What is the bottom? 6k is showing some strength though 3k would be what many traders shorting  bitcoin -0.42%  would project. 
 - When will the trip to the moon arrive? The 2014 recovery suggests years of relatively boring price movement. 

6k vs 3k Bottom 

Bearish  traders would be waiting to see  Bitcoin -0.42%  fulfill historic price patterns and correct close to the 3k price level. However  Bitcoin -0.42%  has shown some signs of strength since it’s fall from 20k. The first sign was the breaking out from the strong downward  trend line  formed from the 20k and 17k peaks which went from resistance to support line. 






The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin -0.42%  price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin -0.42%  fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash 0.23% . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss. 

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

",,19,0,1
1530607284.0,PNUTTY,"Bitcoin Showing Some Strength, But Too Soon for Dec 2017 Revival","
By now most  Bitcoin -0.33%  hodlers and enthusiasts would be well aware of the previous  Bitcoin -0.33%  price surges and the price corrections that follow. The 2014 price surge experienced a correction close to the price where the surge began (0.786–1 retrace), and was followed by a pro-longed period of relatively boring price action as can be seen in the graph above. 

With this in mind many hodlers have come to accept that time and patience are crucial ingredients for what they hope would be the next trip to the moon. The questions on everyone’s minds are now simply: 
 - What is the bottom? 6k is showing some strength though 3k would be what many traders shorting  bitcoin -0.33%  would project. 
 - When will the trip to the moon arrive? The 2014 recovery suggests years of relatively boring price movement. 

6k vs 3k Bottom 

Bearish  traders would be waiting to see  Bitcoin -0.33%  fulfill historic price patterns and correct close to the 3k price level. However  Bitcoin -0.33%  has shown some signs of strength since it’s fall from 20k. The first sign was the breaking out from the strong downward  trend line  formed from the 20k and 17k peaks which went from resistance to support line. 






The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin -0.33%  price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin -0.33%  fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash 0.21% . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

I'm looking at the possibility of a  rising wedge  here and have taken profits on alts and opened small short positions.  

If it breaks I will stop out otherwise we could revisit the 6200 area and retest the support of the old bear resistance TL.  Timeframe looks like the next 24 hours for confirmation.   

Irrespectively there's a nice bottoming out feeling for  BTC -0.33%  0.32% here and feeling confident of staying above $6k although not quite bull (yet). I'm trading both ways in small scalps where opportunities present themselves.

There has been a lot of conversation about  BTCUSD -0.33%  and the Longs approaching a high level so I thought I would look at the short history of  BTCUSD Longs 1.39%  on Bitfinex and see if there is anything we can glean.  This isn’t a full academic study but my first impressions looking at the data. 

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD -0.33% .  My two main thoughts are a lot of people opened positions with extreme leverage in their enthusiasm, completely consumed with FOMO and the idea that  BTCUSD -0.33%  can only go up and they got liquidated by a relatively small change in price. 

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss.

Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right.

The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

If it breaks I will stop out otherwise we could revisit the 6200 area and retest the support of the old bear resistance TL.  Timeframe looks like the next 24 hours for confirmation.

There has been a lot of conversation about  BTCUSD -0.42%  and the Longs approaching a high level so I thought I would look at the short history of  BTCUSD Longs 1.38%  on Bitfinex and see if there is anything we can glean.  This isn’t a full academic study but my first impressions looking at the data. 

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD -0.42% .  My two main thoughts are a lot of people opened positions with extreme leverage in their enthusiasm, completely consumed with FOMO and the idea that  BTCUSD -0.42%  can only go up and they got liquidated by a relatively small change in price. 

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss. 

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

",,19,0,1
1530607284.0,PNUTTY,"Bitcoin Showing Some Strength, But Too Soon for Dec 2017 Revival","
By now most  Bitcoin -0.40%  hodlers and enthusiasts would be well aware of the previous  Bitcoin -0.40%  price surges and the price corrections that follow. The 2014 price surge experienced a correction close to the price where the surge began (0.786–1 retrace), and was followed by a pro-longed period of relatively boring price action as can be seen in the graph above. 

With this in mind many hodlers have come to accept that time and patience are crucial ingredients for what they hope would be the next trip to the moon. The questions on everyone’s minds are now simply: 
 - What is the bottom? 6k is showing some strength though 3k would be what many traders shorting  bitcoin -0.40%  would project. 
 - When will the trip to the moon arrive? The 2014 recovery suggests years of relatively boring price movement. 

6k vs 3k Bottom 

Bearish  traders would be waiting to see  Bitcoin -0.40%  fulfill historic price patterns and correct close to the 3k price level. However  Bitcoin -0.40%  has shown some signs of strength since it’s fall from 20k. The first sign was the breaking out from the strong downward  trend line  formed from the 20k and 17k peaks which went from resistance to support line. 






The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin -0.40%  price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin -0.40%  fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash 0.02% . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

By now most  Bitcoin              hodlers and enthusiasts would be well aware of the previous  Bitcoin              price surges and the price corrections that follow. The 2014 price surge experienced a correction close to the price where the surge began (0.786–1 retrace), and was followed by a pro-longed period of relatively boring price action as can be seen in the graph above. 

With this in mind many hodlers have come to accept that time and patience are crucial ingredients for what they hope would be the next trip to the moon. The questions on everyone’s minds are now simply: 
 - What is the bottom? 6k is showing some strength though 3k would be what many traders shorting  bitcoin              would project. 
 - When will the trip to the moon arrive? The 2014 recovery suggests years of relatively boring price movement. 

6k vs 3k Bottom 

Bearish  traders would be waiting to see  Bitcoin              fulfill historic price patterns and correct close to the 3k price level. However  Bitcoin              has shown some signs of strength since it’s fall from 20k. The first sign was the breaking out from the strong downward  trend line  formed from the 20k and 17k peaks which went from resistance to support line. 






The next and more recent sign has been the development of a 6k support line as the  Bitcoin              price failed to make lower lows: 







The price behavior of not forming lower lows forms a psychological support, though the history of price movements in 2014 shows that there is plenty of time for a price correction closer to 3k. With such sideways price action, either scenario of a return to a price greater than 10k followed by a re-test 9k, or a price drop to 3k both appear equally possible. 

Next Trip to the Moon 

I still haven’t figured out what was the single biggest driver of the 20k price: FOMO or price pumps from USDT (probably both). With that in mind, major price movements have often been a product of something extreme. Whether it be pure fear or exchange hacks and crashes, as time goes on the sensitivity of the market to information that has previously been published and experienced softens. This can be evidenced by the reduction in market reaction by  Bitcoin              fork announcements that followed after  Bitcoin Cash             . 

The market requires something new not previously experienced, and in the world of cryptocurrencies there is more than enough room for “first to be experienced” events. To that end, possible developments that may lead to strong upward price action relate to the mass adoption by institutional investors and the significant progress in the area of cryptocurrency regulation. These will play key roles in forming an environment by which potential “moon” type price movements could occur, and will go hand in hand as regulatory bodies lay the roads by which institutions can take part in what is often described as a social movement. 

Where Are We Now 

If you put 2014 and 2017 peaks roughly together, it’s easy to see the price movement similarities. As they sometimes say, history doesn’t repeat but rather rhymes. The sound of the beat is in tune with 2014, though  bearish  predictions to 3k have not been realized as fast as short position traders have hoped, and  bullish  price movements “to the moon” are probably not expected at such an early stage. 

Newbies should be wary of the many  bullish  technical analysts publishing charts with reversal patterns and over simplified upward trending price channels heading to 100k. 20k was a psychological barrier that took place in an environment that is different to today, and for price momentum to build up for a break above 20k, the environment needs to be right for such a setup and will also require a significant event or development.

There has been a lot of conversation about  BTCUSD              and the Longs approaching a high level so I thought I would look at the short history of  BTCUSD Longs              on Bitfinex and see if there is anything we can glean.  This isn’t a full academic study but my first impressions looking at the data. 

First a note about these ranges.  You cannot anchor them so as you adjust the y axis the bars don’t move, so the percent changes are a lie, but they do give you some idea of relative change.  I have the  ichimoku cloud  on there but I eliminated all the spans for readability.   

At first glance I find the orange bars most interesting.  We see a drastic drop in the number of longs with a very little difference in percent change of  BTCUSD             .  My two main thoughts are a lot of people opened positions with extreme leverage in their enthusiasm, completely consumed with FOMO and the idea that  BTCUSD              can only go up and they got liquidated by a relatively small change in price. 

An assumption that gives more credit to the traders is these positions were not liquidated, but the traders took their positions off the books when they saw the price stall.  Either they took profit if they opened their longs earlier or, having just opened their longs recently they closed them manually or via stop loss. 

The red bars show where there were clear warning signs in the price action that a deeper drop was going to come and we see that was backed up by a rise in shorts.  Most traders don’t short but given that shorts rose it is my assumption that that a higher portion of the longs in the red were taken off the books, rather than being liquidated.  Countering that assumption is the second red arrow we see both longs and shorts climbing. 

Purple???  Really, I don’t know.  The longs exited too soon and the shorts declined too soon as well.  Purple doesn’t seem right. 

Green also does not make sense when combined with the green arrow.  I could imagine a massive amount of people being taken by surprise that the end was upon them but shorts dipped as well.  Maybe shorter were not emotionally committed or were spooked after the purple area, but as I mentioned, the purple arrow doesn’t make sense either. 

Grey seems to be the best example of a pure long squeeze.  We were in a trough, a daily  MACD  had just occurred and we were taking off and then a red candle wipes out two days worth of gains and sets up the shorts to be liquidated a few short days later. 
If we are due for a long squeeze both the red and the orange long squeezes could be endured by traders that are not excessively leveraged.  The red gives traders time to get out and the orange has such low relative percent change that most of us wouldn’t be taken to the cleaners. 
Quite frankly most traders could even get through the grey area which looks the most like a artificial long squeeze so long as they avoid exuberant uses of leverage because they thing the great bull run is upon us. 
Finally, I am still biased bear and I have a strong suspicion we will be rejected by the cloud outright or we will get rejected in the cloud.  This will give us a lower high and set us up for another lower low on this leg down. 
I am still  bearish  due to the monthly chart and an understanding that bubble theory demands we go below the linear price line, in thick red.

If it breaks I will stop out otherwise we could revisit the 6200 area and retest the support of the old bear resistance TL.  Timeframe looks like the next 24 hours for confirmation.   

Irrespectively there's a nice bottoming out feeling for  BTC -0.44%  0.32% here and feeling confident of staying above $6k although not quite bull (yet). I'm trading both ways in small scalps where opportunities present themselves.  

Happy trading and good luck!

BITFINEX:BTCUSD -0.44% Thank you for bearing the pain of seeing the  bitcoin -0.44%  in that price, cumbersome area and low  trend line  for several days. 


With a few things going on in big countries and big volumes going into  bitcoin -0.44% , we can see a similar bullfight we saw last year. 





Buy the cold days because the bears will stop hibernating one day and they will have to eat =(buy) again.

Observing how previous bubbles have popped, I don't think we're just quite done with the overall  bearish trend  of  BTC -0.44%  yet. 

Taking into considering the movement and Fibo lines, I believe  BTC -0.44%  has to reach the 5000 dollar mark before fully recovering. 

Going long right now and not having the patience to wait out the trap could mean losses.
