Bitcoin bears surpass $6,000 mark, further  bearish  skepticism persists as cyber-security expert reckons cryptocurrency to hinder U.S. elections: 

Bitcoin 0.30%  prices soared during Donal Trump’s victory back in 2016. But for now,  Bitcoin 0.30%  is continuously breaking its lowest points of 2018.  BTC 0.30%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin 0.30%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash. 

Technically, the current prices are well below 7DMA despite today’s upswings,  bearish  swings are in tandem with both momentum as well as trend indicators. We see no traces of recovery so far, the major trend is on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017 (refer weekly plotting). 

The US Senate committee was set up to hear the issue of cryptocurrency potentially being utilized to manipulate future elections as primaries were being held in several states. While the social media platforms during the significant part of 2017 and even this year, have taken a lot of heat over their alleged role in influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election. During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future. 

According to Scott Dueweke, a cyber-security veteran and the president of Identity and Payments Association (IDPAY), digital currencies are the flawless tool for use by state actors and foreign parties seeking to influence the political process in the United States. 

In the U.S.,  bitcoin 0.30%  campaign contributions to the political campaign were first allowed by the Federal Elections Committee in 2014. However, the maximum that could be contributed by an individual was set at $100 through the FEC did not limit the amount of  Bitcoin 0.30%  contributions that could be made to Super PACs (Political Action Committees). 

Dueweke, who is also the director of the identity & secure transactions at DarkTower, was testifying before Senate Judiciary Committee in a hearing that was led by Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina.

I am shorting  BTC 0.30%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Next reasonable support line will be down to 4,9-5,0kUSD.

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD 0.30%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin 0.30%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin 0.30%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -2.75%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .  

Latest news 
Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin 0.30%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.” 
Bithumb Reveals 11 Cryptocurrencies Lost and Plan to Compensate Customers

Bithumb has provided a breakdown of the 11 cryptocurrencies that it claims were stolen. They are BCH,  BTC 0.30%  (692 coins), ELF (409.962), ETH(2,219), ETHOS(42700),  GNT             (1015090), HSR(6240), KNC(50000), OMG(300),  VEN 0.00% (420), and XRP(5227490). The largest damage is in  BTC 0.30% , which had about 13.9 billion won (~$12,377,255) stolen. According to Bithumb, the total amount stolen is 18,945,911,857  KRW              or $16,892,614. 
Bithumb has also revealed its plan to compensate all affected users. Reiterating that it takes full responsibility, the exchange announced that it is organizing “a compensation airdrop event.”

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD 0.29%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin 0.29%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin 0.29%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -2.75%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .

Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin 0.29%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.”

Bitcoin bears surpass $6,000 mark, further  bearish  skepticism persists as cyber-security expert reckons cryptocurrency to hinder U.S. elections: 

Bitcoin 0.30%  prices soared during Donal Trump’s victory back in 2016. But for now,  Bitcoin 0.30%  is continuously breaking its lowest points of 2018.  BTC 0.30%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin 0.30%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash. 

Technically, the current prices are well below 7DMA despite today’s upswings,  bearish  swings are in tandem with both momentum as well as trend indicators. We see no traces of recovery so far, the major trend is on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017 (refer weekly plotting). 

The US Senate committee was set up to hear the issue of cryptocurrency potentially being utilized to manipulate future elections as primaries were being held in several states. While the social media platforms during the significant part of 2017 and even this year, have taken a lot of heat over their alleged role in influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election. During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future. 

According to Scott Dueweke, a cyber-security veteran and the president of Identity and Payments Association (IDPAY), digital currencies are the flawless tool for use by state actors and foreign parties seeking to influence the political process in the United States. 

In the U.S.,  bitcoin 0.30%  campaign contributions to the political campaign were first allowed by the Federal Elections Committee in 2014. However, the maximum that could be contributed by an individual was set at $100 through the FEC did not limit the amount of  Bitcoin 0.30%  contributions that could be made to Super PACs (Political Action Committees). 

Dueweke, who is also the director of the identity & secure transactions at DarkTower, was testifying before Senate Judiciary Committee in a hearing that was led by Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina.

I am shorting  BTC              at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Bitcoin bears surpass $6,000 mark, further  bearish  skepticism persists as cyber-security expert reckons cryptocurrency to hinder U.S. elections: 

Bitcoin 0.30%  prices soared during Donal Trump’s victory back in 2016. But for now,  Bitcoin 0.30%  is continuously breaking its lowest points of 2018.  BTC 0.30%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin 0.30%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash. 

Technically, the current prices are well below 7DMA despite today’s upswings,  bearish  swings are in tandem with both momentum as well as trend indicators. We see no traces of recovery so far, the major trend is on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017 (refer weekly plotting). 

The US Senate committee was set up to hear the issue of cryptocurrency potentially being utilized to manipulate future elections as primaries were being held in several states. While the social media platforms during the significant part of 2017 and even this year, have taken a lot of heat over their alleged role in influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election. During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future. 

According to Scott Dueweke, a cyber-security veteran and the president of Identity and Payments Association (IDPAY), digital currencies are the flawless tool for use by state actors and foreign parties seeking to influence the political process in the United States. 

In the U.S.,  bitcoin 0.30%  campaign contributions to the political campaign were first allowed by the Federal Elections Committee in 2014. However, the maximum that could be contributed by an individual was set at $100 through the FEC did not limit the amount of  Bitcoin 0.30%  contributions that could be made to Super PACs (Political Action Committees).

I am shorting  BTC              at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD 0.30%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin 0.30%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin 0.30%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -2.75%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .  

Latest news 
Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin 0.30%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.” 
Bithumb Reveals 11 Cryptocurrencies Lost and Plan to Compensate Customers 
South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb has announced the 11 cryptocurrencies stolen in last week’s theft and the amount of each coin missing. A compensation plan has also been unveiled for the equivalent value of the lost coins in an undetermined cryptocurrency. 
Bithumb has provided a breakdown of the 11 cryptocurrencies that it claims were stolen. They are BCH,  BTC 0.30%  (692 coins), ELF (409.962), ETH(2,219), ETHOS(42700),  GNT             (1015090), HSR(6240), KNC(50000), OMG(300),  VEN             (420), and XRP(5227490). The largest damage is in  BTC 0.30% , which had about 13.9 billion won (~$12,377,255) stolen. According to Bithumb, the total amount stolen is 18,945,911,857  KRW              or $16,892,614. 
Bithumb has also revealed its plan to compensate all affected users. Reiterating that it takes full responsibility, the exchange announced that it is organizing “a compensation airdrop event.”

If  bitcoin 0.30%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin 0.30%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -2.75%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .

Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin 0.30%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.”

BTC 0.30%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin 0.30%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash.

During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future. 

According to Scott Dueweke, a cyber-security veteran and the president of Identity and Payments Association (IDPAY), digital currencies are the flawless tool for use by state actors and foreign parties seeking to influence the political process in the United States.

I am shorting  BTC 0.30%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD 0.29%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin 0.29%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level.

Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement.

According to Scott Dueweke, a cyber-security veteran and the president of Identity and Payments Association (IDPAY), digital currencies are the flawless tool for use by state actors and foreign parties seeking to influence the political process in the United States. 

In the U.S.,  bitcoin 0.30%  campaign contributions to the political campaign were first allowed by the Federal Elections Committee in 2014. However, the maximum that could be contributed by an individual was set at $100 through the FEC did not limit the amount of  Bitcoin 0.30%  contributions that could be made to Super PACs (Political Action Committees). 

Dueweke, who is also the director of the identity & secure transactions at DarkTower, was testifying before Senate Judiciary Committee in a hearing that was led by Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina.

I am shorting  BTC 0.30%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Resting AT THE support line at moment, we will see will it close daily candle above this support.

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD 0.29%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin 0.29%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin 0.29%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -2.75%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .  

Latest news 
Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin 0.29%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.”

Bitcoin bears surpass $6,000 mark, further  bearish  skepticism persists as cyber-security expert reckons cryptocurrency to hinder U.S. elections: 

Bitcoin              prices soared during Donal Trump’s victory back in 2016. But for now,  Bitcoin              is continuously breaking its lowest points of 2018.  BTC              is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin              broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash. 

Technically, the current prices are well below 7DMA despite today’s upswings,  bearish  swings are in tandem with both momentum as well as trend indicators. We see no traces of recovery so far, the major trend is on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017 (refer weekly plotting). 

The US Senate committee was set up to hear the issue of cryptocurrency potentially being utilized to manipulate future elections as primaries were being held in several states. While the social media platforms during the significant part of 2017 and even this year, have taken a lot of heat over their alleged role in influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election. During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future. 

According to Scott Dueweke, a cyber-security veteran and the president of Identity and Payments Association (IDPAY), digital currencies are the flawless tool for use by state actors and foreign parties seeking to influence the political process in the United States. 

In the U.S.,  bitcoin              campaign contributions to the political campaign were first allowed by the Federal Elections Committee in 2014.

For now,  BTCUSD 0.29%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again.

To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin 0.29%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level.

Bitcoin bears surpass $6,000 mark, further  bearish  skepticism persists as cyber-security expert reckons cryptocurrency to hinder U.S. elections: 

Bitcoin 0.29%  prices soared during Donal Trump’s victory back in 2016. But for now,  Bitcoin 0.29%  is continuously breaking its lowest points of 2018.  BTC 0.29%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin 0.29%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash. 

Technically, the current prices are well below 7DMA despite today’s upswings,  bearish  swings are in tandem with both momentum as well as trend indicators. We see no traces of recovery so far, the major trend is on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017 (refer weekly plotting). 

The US Senate committee was set up to hear the issue of cryptocurrency potentially being utilized to manipulate future elections as primaries were being held in several states. While the social media platforms during the significant part of 2017 and even this year, have taken a lot of heat over their alleged role in influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election. During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future. 

According to Scott Dueweke, a cyber-security veteran and the president of Identity and Payments Association (IDPAY), digital currencies are the flawless tool for use by state actors and foreign parties seeking to influence the political process in the United States. 

In the U.S.,  bitcoin 0.29%  campaign contributions to the political campaign were first allowed by the Federal Elections Committee in 2014. However, the maximum that could be contributed by an individual was set at $100 through the FEC did not limit the amount of  Bitcoin 0.29%  contributions that could be made to Super PACs (Political Action Committees). 

Dueweke, who is also the director of the identity & secure transactions at DarkTower, was testifying before Senate Judiciary Committee in a hearing that was led by Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina.

I am shorting  BTC 0.29%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*  

With love,

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD 0.30%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin 0.30%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin 0.30%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -2.75%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .  

Latest news 
Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin 0.30%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.” 
Bithumb Reveals 11 Cryptocurrencies Lost and Plan to Compensate Customers

The largest damage is in  BTC 0.30% , which had about 13.9 billion won (~$12,377,255) stolen. According to Bithumb, the total amount stolen is 18,945,911,857  KRW -1.31%  or $16,892,614. 
Bithumb has also revealed its plan to compensate all affected users. Reiterating that it takes full responsibility, the exchange announced that it is organizing “a compensation airdrop event.”

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD 0.29%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin 0.29%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin 0.29%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -2.75%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .

Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin 0.29%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.”

BTC 0.29%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin 0.29%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash.

During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future. 

According to Scott Dueweke, a cyber-security veteran and the president of Identity and Payments Association (IDPAY), digital currencies are the flawless tool for use by state actors and foreign parties seeking to influence the political process in the United States. 

In the U.S.,  bitcoin 0.29%  campaign contributions to the political campaign were first allowed by the Federal Elections Committee in 2014. However, the maximum that could be contributed by an individual was set at $100 through the FEC did not limit the amount of  Bitcoin 0.29%  contributions that could be made to Super PACs (Political Action Committees).

I am shorting  BTC 0.30%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

BTC 0.17%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin 0.17%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash. 

Technically, the current prices are well below 7DMA despite today’s upswings,  bearish  swings are in tandem with both momentum as well as trend indicators. We see no traces of recovery so far, the major trend is on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017 (refer weekly plotting). 

The US Senate committee was set up to hear the issue of cryptocurrency potentially being utilized to manipulate future elections as primaries were being held in several states. While the social media platforms during the significant part of 2017 and even this year, have taken a lot of heat over their alleged role in influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election. During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future. 

According to Scott Dueweke, a cyber-security veteran and the president of Identity and Payments Association (IDPAY), digital currencies are the flawless tool for use by state actors and foreign parties seeking to influence the political process in the United States. 

In the U.S.,  bitcoin 0.17%  campaign contributions to the political campaign were first allowed by the Federal Elections Committee in 2014. However, the maximum that could be contributed by an individual was set at $100 through the FEC did not limit the amount of  Bitcoin 0.17%  contributions that could be made to Super PACs (Political Action Committees). 

Dueweke, who is also the director of the identity & secure transactions at DarkTower, was testifying before Senate Judiciary Committee in a hearing that was led by Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina.

I am shorting  BTC 0.17%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD              went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin              goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin              traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures              on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .  

Latest news 
Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin              users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.” 
Bithumb Reveals 11 Cryptocurrencies Lost and Plan to Compensate Customers 
South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb has announced the 11 cryptocurrencies stolen in last week’s theft and the amount of each coin missing. A compensation plan has also been unveiled for the equivalent value of the lost coins in an undetermined cryptocurrency. 
Bithumb has provided a breakdown of the 11 cryptocurrencies that it claims were stolen. They are BCH,  BTC              (692 coins), ELF (409.962), ETH(2,219), ETHOS(42700),  GNT             (1015090), HSR(6240), KNC(50000), OMG(300),  VEN             (420), and XRP(5227490). The largest damage is in  BTC             , which had about 13.9 billion won (~$12,377,255) stolen. According to Bithumb, the total amount stolen is 18,945,911,857  KRW              or $16,892,614. 
Bithumb has also revealed its plan to compensate all affected users. Reiterating that it takes full responsibility, the exchange announced that it is organizing “a compensation airdrop event.”

Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin 0.16%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.”

Bitcoin 0.16%  prices soared during Donal Trump’s victory back in 2016. But for now,  Bitcoin 0.16%  is continuously breaking its lowest points of 2018.  BTC 0.16%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin 0.16%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash. 

Technically, the current prices are well below 7DMA despite today’s upswings,  bearish  swings are in tandem with both momentum as well as trend indicators. We see no traces of recovery so far, the major trend is on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017 (refer weekly plotting).

During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future. 

According to Scott Dueweke, a cyber-security veteran and the president of Identity and Payments Association (IDPAY), digital currencies are the flawless tool for use by state actors and foreign parties seeking to influence the political process in the United States. 

In the U.S.,  bitcoin 0.16%  campaign contributions to the political campaign were first allowed by the Federal Elections Committee in 2014. However, the maximum that could be contributed by an individual was set at $100 through the FEC did not limit the amount of  Bitcoin 0.16%  contributions that could be made to Super PACs (Political Action Committees).

I am shorting  BTC              at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD 0.05%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin 0.05%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin 0.05%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -2.75%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .

In the U.S.,  bitcoin 0.02%  campaign contributions to the political campaign were first allowed by the Federal Elections Committee in 2014. However, the maximum that could be contributed by an individual was set at $100 through the FEC did not limit the amount of  Bitcoin 0.02%  contributions that could be made to Super PACs (Political Action Committees). 

Dueweke, who is also the director of the identity & secure transactions at DarkTower, was testifying before Senate Judiciary Committee in a hearing that was led by Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina.

I am shorting  BTC 0.02%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Resting AT THE support line at moment, we will see will it close daily candle above this support.  
Next reasonable support line will be down to 4,9-5,0kUSD.

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD 0.00%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin 0.00%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin 0.00%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -2.75%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .

Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin 0.00%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.”

Bitcoin bears surpass $6,000 mark, further  bearish  skepticism persists as cyber-security expert reckons cryptocurrency to hinder U.S. elections: 

Bitcoin 0.00%  prices soared during Donal Trump’s victory back in 2016. But for now,  Bitcoin 0.00%  is continuously breaking its lowest points of 2018.  BTC 0.00%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin 0.00%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash. 

Technically, the current prices are well below 7DMA despite today’s upswings,  bearish  swings are in tandem with both momentum as well as trend indicators. We see no traces of recovery so far, the major trend is on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017 (refer weekly plotting). 

The US Senate committee was set up to hear the issue of cryptocurrency potentially being utilized to manipulate future elections as primaries were being held in several states. While the social media platforms during the significant part of 2017 and even this year, have taken a lot of heat over their alleged role in influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election. During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future. 

According to Scott Dueweke, a cyber-security veteran and the president of Identity and Payments Association (IDPAY), digital currencies are the flawless tool for use by state actors and foreign parties seeking to influence the political process in the United States. 

In the U.S.,  bitcoin 0.00%  campaign contributions to the political campaign were first allowed by the Federal Elections Committee in 2014. However, the maximum that could be contributed by an individual was set at $100 through the FEC did not limit the amount of  Bitcoin 0.00%  contributions that could be made to Super PACs (Political Action Committees).

For example, if during a day the price approaches the upper (lower) mark, it can be concluded that it will not go higher (lower) prescribed mark today with already known probability. So, you can open a position opposite to the current movement, knowing in advance that it will be profitable with certain probability.

Bitcoin bears surpass $6,000 mark, further  bearish  skepticism persists as cyber-security expert reckons cryptocurrency to hinder U.S. elections: 

Bitcoin -0.18%  prices soared during Donal Trump’s victory back in 2016. But for now,  Bitcoin -0.18%  is continuously breaking its lowest points of 2018.  BTC -0.18%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin -0.18%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash. 

Technically, the current prices are well below 7DMA despite today’s upswings,  bearish  swings are in tandem with both momentum as well as trend indicators. We see no traces of recovery so far, the major trend is on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017 (refer weekly plotting). 

The US Senate committee was set up to hear the issue of cryptocurrency potentially being utilized to manipulate future elections as primaries were being held in several states. While the social media platforms during the significant part of 2017 and even this year, have taken a lot of heat over their alleged role in influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election. During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future. 

According to Scott Dueweke, a cyber-security veteran and the president of Identity and Payments Association (IDPAY), digital currencies are the flawless tool for use by state actors and foreign parties seeking to influence the political process in the United States. 

In the U.S.,  bitcoin -0.18%  campaign contributions to the political campaign were first allowed by the Federal Elections Committee in 2014. However, the maximum that could be contributed by an individual was set at $100 through the FEC did not limit the amount of  Bitcoin -0.18%  contributions that could be made to Super PACs (Political Action Committees).

I am shorting  BTC -0.18%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD              went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin              goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin              traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures              on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .  

Latest news 
Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin              users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.” 
Bithumb Reveals 11 Cryptocurrencies Lost and Plan to Compensate Customers 
South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb has announced the 11 cryptocurrencies stolen in last week’s theft and the amount of each coin missing. A compensation plan has also been unveiled for the equivalent value of the lost coins in an undetermined cryptocurrency. 
Bithumb has provided a breakdown of the 11 cryptocurrencies that it claims were stolen. They are BCH,  BTC              (692 coins), ELF (409.962), ETH(2,219), ETHOS(42700),  GNT             (1015090), HSR(6240), KNC(50000), OMG(300),  VEN             (420), and XRP(5227490). The largest damage is in  BTC             , which had about 13.9 billion won (~$12,377,255) stolen. According to Bithumb, the total amount stolen is 18,945,911,857  KRW              or $16,892,614. 
Bithumb has also revealed its plan to compensate all affected users. Reiterating that it takes full responsibility, the exchange announced that it is organizing “a compensation airdrop event.”

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*  

With love,

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD              went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin              goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin              traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures              on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .

Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin              users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.”

Bitcoin -0.01%  prices soared during Donal Trump’s victory back in 2016. But for now,  Bitcoin -0.01%  is continuously breaking its lowest points of 2018.  BTC -0.01%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin -0.01%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash. 

Technically, the current prices are well below 7DMA despite today’s upswings,  bearish  swings are in tandem with both momentum as well as trend indicators. We see no traces of recovery so far, the major trend is on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017 (refer weekly plotting). 

The US Senate committee was set up to hear the issue of cryptocurrency potentially being utilized to manipulate future elections as primaries were being held in several states. While the social media platforms during the significant part of 2017 and even this year, have taken a lot of heat over their alleged role in influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election. During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future. 

According to Scott Dueweke, a cyber-security veteran and the president of Identity and Payments Association (IDPAY), digital currencies are the flawless tool for use by state actors and foreign parties seeking to influence the political process in the United States. 

In the U.S.,  bitcoin -0.01%  campaign contributions to the political campaign were first allowed by the Federal Elections Committee in 2014. However, the maximum that could be contributed by an individual was set at $100 through the FEC did not limit the amount of  Bitcoin -0.01%  contributions that could be made to Super PACs (Political Action Committees).

I am shorting  BTC -0.01%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

I am shorting  BTC              at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD 0.12%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin 0.12%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin 0.12%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -2.83%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .  

Latest news 
Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin 0.12%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.” 
Bithumb Reveals 11 Cryptocurrencies Lost and Plan to Compensate Customers

Bithumb has provided a breakdown of the 11 cryptocurrencies that it claims were stolen. They are BCH,  BTC 0.12%  (692 coins), ELF (409.962), ETH(2,219), ETHOS(42700),  GNT 0.32% (1015090), HSR(6240), KNC(50000), OMG(300),  VEN             (420), and XRP(5227490). The largest damage is in  BTC 0.12% , which had about 13.9 billion won (~$12,377,255) stolen. According to Bithumb, the total amount stolen is 18,945,911,857  KRW              or $16,892,614. 
Bithumb has also revealed its plan to compensate all affected users. Reiterating that it takes full responsibility, the exchange announced that it is organizing “a compensation airdrop event.”

Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin              users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.”

BTC 0.08%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin 0.08%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash.

During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future. 

According to Scott Dueweke, a cyber-security veteran and the president of Identity and Payments Association (IDPAY), digital currencies are the flawless tool for use by state actors and foreign parties seeking to influence the political process in the United States.

I am shorting  BTC              at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD 0.08%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin 0.08%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin 0.08%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -2.83%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .

I am shorting  BTC 0.07%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD -0.05%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin -0.05%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin -0.05%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -2.83%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .

Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin -0.05%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.”

Bitcoin bears surpass $6,000 mark, further  bearish  skepticism persists as cyber-security expert reckons cryptocurrency to hinder U.S. elections: 

Bitcoin -0.05%  prices soared during Donal Trump’s victory back in 2016. But for now,  Bitcoin -0.05%  is continuously breaking its lowest points of 2018.  BTC -0.05%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin -0.05%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash. 

Technically, the current prices are well below 7DMA despite today’s upswings,  bearish  swings are in tandem with both momentum as well as trend indicators. We see no traces of recovery so far, the major trend is on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017 (refer weekly plotting). 

The US Senate committee was set up to hear the issue of cryptocurrency potentially being utilized to manipulate future elections as primaries were being held in several states. While the social media platforms during the significant part of 2017 and even this year, have taken a lot of heat over their alleged role in influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election. During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future. 

According to Scott Dueweke, a cyber-security veteran and the president of Identity and Payments Association (IDPAY), digital currencies are the flawless tool for use by state actors and foreign parties seeking to influence the political process in the United States. 

In the U.S.,  bitcoin -0.05%  campaign contributions to the political campaign were first allowed by the Federal Elections Committee in 2014. However, the maximum that could be contributed by an individual was set at $100 through the FEC did not limit the amount of  Bitcoin -0.05%  contributions that could be made to Super PACs (Political Action Committees).

Bitcoin bears surpass $6,000 mark, further  bearish  skepticism persists as cyber-security expert reckons cryptocurrency to hinder U.S. elections: 

Bitcoin -0.05%  prices soared during Donal Trump’s victory back in 2016. But for now,  Bitcoin -0.05%  is continuously breaking its lowest points of 2018.  BTC -0.05%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin -0.05%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash. 

Technically, the current prices are well below 7DMA despite today’s upswings,  bearish  swings are in tandem with both momentum as well as trend indicators. We see no traces of recovery so far, the major trend is on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017 (refer weekly plotting). 

The US Senate committee was set up to hear the issue of cryptocurrency potentially being utilized to manipulate future elections as primaries were being held in several states. While the social media platforms during the significant part of 2017 and even this year, have taken a lot of heat over their alleged role in influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election. During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future. 

According to Scott Dueweke, a cyber-security veteran and the president of Identity and Payments Association (IDPAY), digital currencies are the flawless tool for use by state actors and foreign parties seeking to influence the political process in the United States. 

In the U.S.,  bitcoin -0.05%  campaign contributions to the political campaign were first allowed by the Federal Elections Committee in 2014. However, the maximum that could be contributed by an individual was set at $100 through the FEC did not limit the amount of  Bitcoin -0.05%  contributions that could be made to Super PACs (Political Action Committees).

I am shorting  BTC -0.05%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD -0.05%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin -0.05%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin -0.05%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -2.92%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .  

Latest news 
Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin -0.05%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.”

The largest damage is in  BTC -0.05% , which had about 13.9 billion won (~$12,377,255) stolen. According to Bithumb, the total amount stolen is 18,945,911,857  KRW              or $16,892,614. 
Bithumb has also revealed its plan to compensate all affected users. Reiterating that it takes full responsibility, the exchange announced that it is organizing “a compensation airdrop event.”

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*  

With love,

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD -0.11%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin -0.11%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin -0.11%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -2.92%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .

Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin -0.11%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.”

BTC -0.11%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin -0.11%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash. 

Technically, the current prices are well below 7DMA despite today’s upswings,  bearish  swings are in tandem with both momentum as well as trend indicators. We see no traces of recovery so far, the major trend is on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017 (refer weekly plotting).

During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future. 

According to Scott Dueweke, a cyber-security veteran and the president of Identity and Payments Association (IDPAY), digital currencies are the flawless tool for use by state actors and foreign parties seeking to influence the political process in the United States. 

In the U.S.,  bitcoin -0.11%  campaign contributions to the political campaign were first allowed by the Federal Elections Committee in 2014.

I am shorting  BTC -0.11%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

I am shorting  BTC -0.05%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD -0.05%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin -0.05%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin -0.05%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -3.17%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .  

Latest news 
Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin -0.05%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.” 
Bithumb Reveals 11 Cryptocurrencies Lost and Plan to Compensate Customers

Bithumb has provided a breakdown of the 11 cryptocurrencies that it claims were stolen. They are BCH,  BTC -0.05%  (692 coins), ELF (409.962), ETH(2,219), ETHOS(42700),  GNT 0.32% (1015090), HSR(6240), KNC(50000), OMG(300),  VEN 0.00% (420), and XRP(5227490). The largest damage is in  BTC -0.05% , which had about 13.9 billion won (~$12,377,255) stolen. According to Bithumb, the total amount stolen is 18,945,911,857  KRW              or $16,892,614. 
Bithumb has also revealed its plan to compensate all affected users. Reiterating that it takes full responsibility, the exchange announced that it is organizing “a compensation airdrop event.”

The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.”

I am shorting  BTC 0.09%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD 0.09%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin 0.09%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin 0.09%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -3.17%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .

I am shorting  BTC 0.06%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

BTC 0.08%  may be forming  double bottom  on long term support @5,9k.  
Resting AT THE support line at moment, we will see will it close daily candle above this support.  
Next reasonable support line will be down to 4,9-5,0kUSD.  
On long term holder this could offer some reasonable R/R ratio.

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD 0.04%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin 0.04%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin 0.04%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -3.17%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .  

Latest news 
Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin 0.04%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.”

Bitcoin bears surpass $6,000 mark, further  bearish  skepticism persists as cyber-security expert reckons cryptocurrency to hinder U.S. elections: 

Bitcoin 0.04%  prices soared during Donal Trump’s victory back in 2016. But for now,  Bitcoin 0.04%  is continuously breaking its lowest points of 2018.  BTC 0.04%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin 0.04%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash. 

Technically, the current prices are well below 7DMA despite today’s upswings,  bearish  swings are in tandem with both momentum as well as trend indicators. We see no traces of recovery so far, the major trend is on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017 (refer weekly plotting). 

The US Senate committee was set up to hear the issue of cryptocurrency potentially being utilized to manipulate future elections as primaries were being held in several states. While the social media platforms during the significant part of 2017 and even this year, have taken a lot of heat over their alleged role in influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election. During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future. 

According to Scott Dueweke, a cyber-security veteran and the president of Identity and Payments Association (IDPAY), digital currencies are the flawless tool for use by state actors and foreign parties seeking to influence the political process in the United States. 

In the U.S.,  bitcoin 0.04%  campaign contributions to the political campaign were first allowed by the Federal Elections Committee in 2014. However, the maximum that could be contributed by an individual was set at $100 through the FEC did not limit the amount of  Bitcoin 0.04%  contributions that could be made to Super PACs (Political Action Committees). 

Dueweke, who is also the director of the identity & secure transactions at DarkTower, was testifying before Senate Judiciary Committee in a hearing that was led by Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina.

I am shorting  BTC              at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD 0.03%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin 0.03%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin 0.03%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -3.08%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .  

Latest news 
Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin 0.03%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.” 
Bithumb Reveals 11 Cryptocurrencies Lost and Plan to Compensate Customers 
South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb has announced the 11 cryptocurrencies stolen in last week’s theft and the amount of each coin missing. A compensation plan has also been unveiled for the equivalent value of the lost coins in an undetermined cryptocurrency. 
Bithumb has provided a breakdown of the 11 cryptocurrencies that it claims were stolen. They are BCH,  BTC 0.03%  (692 coins), ELF (409.962), ETH(2,219), ETHOS(42700),  GNT 0.32% (1015090), HSR(6240), KNC(50000), OMG(300),  VEN 0.00% (420), and XRP(5227490). The largest damage is in  BTC 0.03% , which had about 13.9 billion won (~$12,377,255) stolen. According to Bithumb, the total amount stolen is 18,945,911,857  KRW              or $16,892,614. 
Bithumb has also revealed its plan to compensate all affected users. Reiterating that it takes full responsibility, the exchange announced that it is organizing “a compensation airdrop event.”

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*  

With love,

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD -0.01%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin -0.01%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin -0.01%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -3.08%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .

Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin -0.01%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.”

BTC -0.02%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin -0.02%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash.

During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future.

I am shorting  BTC -0.02%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

I am shorting  BTC -0.66%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD -0.48%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin -0.48%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin -0.48%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -3.08%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .  

Latest news 
Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin -0.48%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.” 
Bithumb Reveals 11 Cryptocurrencies Lost and Plan to Compensate Customers

Bithumb has provided a breakdown of the 11 cryptocurrencies that it claims were stolen. They are BCH,  BTC -0.48%  (692 coins), ELF (409.962), ETH(2,219), ETHOS(42700),  GNT             (1015090), HSR(6240), KNC(50000), OMG(300),  VEN             (420), and XRP(5227490). The largest damage is in  BTC -0.48% , which had about 13.9 billion won (~$12,377,255) stolen. According to Bithumb, the total amount stolen is 18,945,911,857  KRW              or $16,892,614. 
Bithumb has also revealed its plan to compensate all affected users. Reiterating that it takes full responsibility, the exchange announced that it is organizing “a compensation airdrop event.”

According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.”

I am shorting  BTC              at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD -0.38%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin -0.38%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin -0.38%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -3.08%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .

Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin -0.38%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050.

No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

BTC -0.24%  may be forming  double bottom  on long term support @5,9k.  
Resting AT THE support line at moment, we will see will it close daily candle above this support.  
Next reasonable support line will be down to 4,9-5,0kUSD.  
On long term holder this could offer some reasonable R/R ratio.  
On concern is volumes staying low which speak on the behalf of still going down to the next support, but there is  
nice divergence forming on 4h chart with price to  MACD  and  RSI .

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD              went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin              goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin              traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures              on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .

Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin              users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.”

The largest damage is in  BTC             , which had about 13.9 billion won (~$12,377,255) stolen. According to Bithumb, the total amount stolen is 18,945,911,857  KRW              or $16,892,614. 
Bithumb has also revealed its plan to compensate all affected users. Reiterating that it takes full responsibility, the exchange announced that it is organizing “a compensation airdrop event.”

Bitcoin bears surpass $6,000 mark, further  bearish  skepticism persists as cyber-security expert reckons cryptocurrency to hinder U.S. elections: 

Bitcoin -0.24%  prices soared during Donal Trump’s victory back in 2016. But for now,  Bitcoin -0.24%  is continuously breaking its lowest points of 2018.  BTC -0.24%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin -0.24%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash. 

Technically, the current prices are well below 7DMA despite today’s upswings,  bearish  swings are in tandem with both momentum as well as trend indicators. We see no traces of recovery so far, the major trend is on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017 (refer weekly plotting). 

The US Senate committee was set up to hear the issue of cryptocurrency potentially being utilized to manipulate future elections as primaries were being held in several states. While the social media platforms during the significant part of 2017 and even this year, have taken a lot of heat over their alleged role in influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election. During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future. 

According to Scott Dueweke, a cyber-security veteran and the president of Identity and Payments Association (IDPAY), digital currencies are the flawless tool for use by state actors and foreign parties seeking to influence the political process in the United States. 

In the U.S.,  bitcoin -0.24%  campaign contributions to the political campaign were first allowed by the Federal Elections Committee in 2014. However, the maximum that could be contributed by an individual was set at $100 through the FEC did not limit the amount of  Bitcoin -0.24%  contributions that could be made to Super PACs (Political Action Committees). 

Dueweke, who is also the director of the identity & secure transactions at DarkTower, was testifying before Senate Judiciary Committee in a hearing that was led by Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina.

For now,  BTCUSD -0.20%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again.

To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin -0.20%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin -0.20%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -3.08%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018).

I am shorting  BTC              at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD -0.20%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin -0.20%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin -0.20%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -3.17%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .  

Latest news 
Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin -0.20%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.” 
Bithumb Reveals 11 Cryptocurrencies Lost and Plan to Compensate Customers

They are BCH,  BTC -0.20%  (692 coins), ELF (409.962), ETH(2,219), ETHOS(42700),  GNT 0.32% (1015090), HSR(6240), KNC(50000), OMG(300),  VEN             (420), and XRP(5227490). The largest damage is in  BTC -0.20% , which had about 13.9 billion won (~$12,377,255) stolen. According to Bithumb, the total amount stolen is 18,945,911,857  KRW              or $16,892,614. 
Bithumb has also revealed its plan to compensate all affected users. Reiterating that it takes full responsibility, the exchange announced that it is organizing “a compensation airdrop event.”

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*  

With love,

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD -0.05%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin -0.05%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin -0.05%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -3.17%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .

Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin -0.05%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.”

BTC -0.05%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin -0.05%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash.

During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future.

I am shorting  BTC -0.05%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

I am shorting  BTC -0.04%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD              went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin              goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin              traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures              on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .  

Latest news 
Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin              users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.” 
Bithumb Reveals 11 Cryptocurrencies Lost and Plan to Compensate Customers 
South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb has announced the 11 cryptocurrencies stolen in last week’s theft and the amount of each coin missing. A compensation plan has also been unveiled for the equivalent value of the lost coins in an undetermined cryptocurrency. 
Bithumb has provided a breakdown of the 11 cryptocurrencies that it claims were stolen. They are BCH,  BTC              (692 coins), ELF (409.962), ETH(2,219), ETHOS(42700),  GNT             (1015090), HSR(6240), KNC(50000), OMG(300),  VEN             (420), and XRP(5227490). The largest damage is in  BTC             , which had about 13.9 billion won (~$12,377,255) stolen. According to Bithumb, the total amount stolen is 18,945,911,857  KRW              or $16,892,614. 
Bithumb has also revealed its plan to compensate all affected users. Reiterating that it takes full responsibility, the exchange announced that it is organizing “a compensation airdrop event.”

According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.”

I am shorting  BTC -0.02%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD -0.02%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin -0.02%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin -0.02%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -3.17%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .

Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin -0.02%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate.

No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD -0.02%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin -0.02%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin -0.02%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -3.17%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .

Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin -0.02%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.”

Bitcoin bears surpass $6,000 mark, further  bearish  skepticism persists as cyber-security expert reckons cryptocurrency to hinder U.S. elections: 

Bitcoin -0.02%  prices soared during Donal Trump’s victory back in 2016. But for now,  Bitcoin -0.02%  is continuously breaking its lowest points of 2018.  BTC -0.02%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin -0.02%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash. 

Technically, the current prices are well below 7DMA despite today’s upswings,  bearish  swings are in tandem with both momentum as well as trend indicators. We see no traces of recovery so far, the major trend is on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017 (refer weekly plotting). 

The US Senate committee was set up to hear the issue of cryptocurrency potentially being utilized to manipulate future elections as primaries were being held in several states. While the social media platforms during the significant part of 2017 and even this year, have taken a lot of heat over their alleged role in influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election. During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future. 

According to Scott Dueweke, a cyber-security veteran and the president of Identity and Payments Association (IDPAY), digital currencies are the flawless tool for use by state actors and foreign parties seeking to influence the political process in the United States. 

In the U.S.,  bitcoin -0.02%  campaign contributions to the political campaign were first allowed by the Federal Elections Committee in 2014. However, the maximum that could be contributed by an individual was set at $100 through the FEC did not limit the amount of  Bitcoin -0.02%  contributions that could be made to Super PACs (Political Action Committees). 

Dueweke, who is also the director of the identity & secure transactions at DarkTower, was testifying before Senate Judiciary Committee in a hearing that was led by Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina.

I am shorting  BTC -0.02%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD -0.02%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin -0.02%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin -0.02%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -3.58%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .  

Latest news 
Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin -0.02%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.” 
Bithumb Reveals 11 Cryptocurrencies Lost and Plan to Compensate Customers

They are BCH,  BTC -0.02%  (692 coins), ELF (409.962), ETH(2,219), ETHOS(42700),  GNT             (1015090), HSR(6240), KNC(50000), OMG(300),  VEN             (420), and XRP(5227490). The largest damage is in  BTC -0.02% , which had about 13.9 billion won (~$12,377,255) stolen. According to Bithumb, the total amount stolen is 18,945,911,857  KRW              or $16,892,614. 
Bithumb has also revealed its plan to compensate all affected users. Reiterating that it takes full responsibility, the exchange announced that it is organizing “a compensation airdrop event.”

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*  

With love,

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD 0.02%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin 0.02%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin 0.02%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -3.33%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .

Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin 0.02%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.”

BTC 0.02%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin 0.02%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash.

During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future. 

According to Scott Dueweke, a cyber-security veteran and the president of Identity and Payments Association (IDPAY), digital currencies are the flawless tool for use by state actors and foreign parties seeking to influence the political process in the United States.

I am shorting  BTC 0.02%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Bitcoin bears surpass $6,000 mark, further  bearish  skepticism persists as cyber-security expert reckons cryptocurrency to hinder U.S. elections: 

Bitcoin 0.01%  prices soared during Donal Trump’s victory back in 2016. But for now,  Bitcoin 0.01%  is continuously breaking its lowest points of 2018.  BTC 0.01%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin 0.01%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash. 

Technically, the current prices are well below 7DMA despite today’s upswings,  bearish  swings are in tandem with both momentum as well as trend indicators. We see no traces of recovery so far, the major trend is on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017 (refer weekly plotting). 

The US Senate committee was set up to hear the issue of cryptocurrency potentially being utilized to manipulate future elections as primaries were being held in several states. While the social media platforms during the significant part of 2017 and even this year, have taken a lot of heat over their alleged role in influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

I am shorting  BTC -0.02%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD -0.03%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin -0.03%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin -0.03%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -3.33%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .  

Latest news 
Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin -0.03%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.” 
Bithumb Reveals 11 Cryptocurrencies Lost and Plan to Compensate Customers

Bithumb has provided a breakdown of the 11 cryptocurrencies that it claims were stolen. They are BCH,  BTC -0.03%  (692 coins), ELF (409.962), ETH(2,219), ETHOS(42700),  GNT             (1015090), HSR(6240), KNC(50000), OMG(300),  VEN 0.00% (420), and XRP(5227490). The largest damage is in  BTC -0.03% , which had about 13.9 billion won (~$12,377,255) stolen. According to Bithumb, the total amount stolen is 18,945,911,857  KRW              or $16,892,614. 
Bithumb has also revealed its plan to compensate all affected users. Reiterating that it takes full responsibility, the exchange announced that it is organizing “a compensation airdrop event.”

According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.”

I am shorting  BTC -0.04%  at 5900 with a stop at 6250 and a TP at 5050. With the strong down trend I believe we will break the crucial  support level  at 5775. No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD -0.01%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin -0.01%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin -0.01%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -3.25%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .

Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin -0.01%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate.

No signs of reversal from the price action hence going short. Good risk to reward 1:3. Might change the TP further down depending on how we approach the next  support level  of 5050

BTC 0.02%  may be forming  double bottom  on long term support @5,9k.  
Resting AT THE support line at moment, we will see will it close daily candle above this support.  
Next reasonable support line will be down to 4,9-5,0kUSD.  
On long term holder this could offer some reasonable R/R ratio.

Fractals are are a beautiful thing when you can take the trade and profit off of a pattern of price action you caught. I guess we'll have to see if this plays out here.  

I'm taking the trade just because that's my style of trading, stop is below. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.  

*This is not advice for you to take a trade, this is a pure gamble (backed by some evidence) and I am risking money that I will not think twice (or even once really)(damn I just thought about it) about losing and am still managing how much risk. Bear trend is still hot and ready to wrekt you.*

Price 
Yesterday we saw another-one bounce-off from the  Bearish Trend Line , which send the price to the 5750.0 level; the low of the last week (5750.0) played it’s supportive role and did not let the price go lower. For now,  BTCUSD -0.02%  went into a lateral movement between 5750 and 6000 levels, if this uncertainty will remain the price will meet  Bearish Trend Line  in a few days again. If such movement will remain and the market will not see a substantial change in buyers interest the price could easily go lower within the next days. To break this vicious downwards pattern we still need to see high volumes and movement above the 6300.0 level, until then it is too dangerous to enter the market. If  bitcoin -0.02%  goes below 5750.0, the next stop should be at 5000.0 level. 
Bitcoin -0.02%  traders should be prepared for volatile weekends as a lot of menaces coincides: the end of the week, months and quarter, plus the expiration of Jun  Bitcoin Futures -3.25%  on  CME  (15 Dec 2017 - 29 Jun 2018). Investors may attempt to unwind their  futures  positions to avoid settlement. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 5750.0 – 6000.0 zone. High probability of increasing  volatility .

Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Still Unsuitable for Large Payments, Research Suggests 
Lighting network – long awaited solution for  Bitcoin -0.02%  users, which has to ensure fast and cheap transactions.  
A recent report published by cryptocurrency research firm Diar suggests that Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, a second-layer solution touted as the answer to the cryptocurrency’s scalability problem, is still unsuitable for large payments. 
According to the report, the network only ensures a 100 percent success rate for payments of $0.03 or less. The chance of successfully sending payments drops as the amount increases, to the point there’s only a 51% chance of being able to send $5.52. Payments of $306 or more only have 1% success rate. 
Diar’s research adds that the number of channels on the network has been steadily growing, but that its efficiency hasn’t. As CCN covered, the Lightning Network crossed 1,000 mainnet payment channels back in February, and now has over 5,050. 
According to The Next Web, Diar’s data was sourced from Reddit user YeOldDoc, who used available data from Lnmainnet.gaben.win to get to the results. According to the website’s data, the Lightning Network currently has 2,326 nodes, and a total capacity of $142,000. 
It’s worth noting that the Lightning Network is still in its infancy. Lightning Labs co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to Diar’s research, arguing the “model itself is flawed, and produces flawed metrics.”

Bitcoin bears surpass $6,000 mark, further  bearish  skepticism persists as cyber-security expert reckons cryptocurrency to hinder U.S. elections: 

Bitcoin -0.02%  prices soared during Donal Trump’s victory back in 2016. But for now,  Bitcoin -0.02%  is continuously breaking its lowest points of 2018.  BTC -0.02%  is currently trading at the price of $5,885. After fighting the resistance,  Bitcoin -0.02%  broke the record again by falling to $5,960, bears have resumed again. The market cap also dropped below the $100 billion margin during the crash. 

Technically, the current prices are well below 7DMA despite today’s upswings,  bearish  swings are in tandem with both momentum as well as trend indicators. We see no traces of recovery so far, the major trend is on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017 (refer weekly plotting). 

The US Senate committee was set up to hear the issue of cryptocurrency potentially being utilized to manipulate future elections as primaries were being held in several states. While the social media platforms during the significant part of 2017 and even this year, have taken a lot of heat over their alleged role in influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election. During a congressional hearing, cryptocurrencies were put in the same spot at least with regards to the future. 

According to Scott Dueweke, a cyber-security veteran and the president of Identity and Payments Association (IDPAY), digital currencies are the flawless tool for use by state actors and foreign parties seeking to influence the political process in the United States. 

In the U.S.,  bitcoin -0.02%  campaign contributions to the political campaign were first allowed by the Federal Elections Committee in 2014. However, the maximum that could be contributed by an individual was set at $100 through the FEC did not limit the amount of  Bitcoin -0.02%  contributions that could be made to Super PACs (Political Action Committees). 

Dueweke, who is also the director of the identity & secure transactions at DarkTower, was testifying before Senate Judiciary Committee in a hearing that was led by Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina.
