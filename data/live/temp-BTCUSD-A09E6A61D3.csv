Warning: I'm relatively new to TA and this is not a financial advice. Do your own research before doing any trades. This idea is just my perspective on current market. 
After a bounce on June 29th,  Bitcoin 0.16%  now faces convergence of resistance: an ascending  wedge  resistance, 7000$ big even level and vicinity of 50 day  SMA , which is very close to 7000 as well. We're at 6 of 9 on daily sequential, so there is a little room to upside. A breakout on July 8th on a daily 9 after failing to break 7000 with  volume  confirmation might take us back to vicinity of mid to low 6200s, but notice:  wedge  pattern is not looking perfect and may not be valid.

6769 is a line of high resistance. Price will have to enter and break the triangular area formed by the resistance line (red), ascending  wedge  (cyan) and the medium term channel (green). This is required to maintain  bullish  momentum. I am not optimist since the current price action is  fractal  of this whole bear market. Once this critical area is saved, a big green candle or sustained buying pressure must be maintained to break the ascending  wedge  upwards.  

Today I expect sideways or more up . Given the current market climate, going down to a new lower low or -higher low- is more likely than going up within the next week.

 BTC 0.09%  has been moving sideways for some time. 

We have seen the price bottom in the 5700s twice before moving back up to our current price. 

If you look at my previous chart - I almost perfectly predicted our current price and time. 

The major resistance points are 6800 and 7200 - we need to break through 6800 in a convincing fashion before we move into the 7200 range and up from there.  The current pattern is showing a reversal of trend for the immediate short term. 

The Bottom Line 

Bitcoin 0.09%  is set for a minor correction.  Judging by the current pattern and the amount of buy pressure it looks like we will form a right shoulder around 6200-6300.  I expect to move sideways as we clear out the resistance at 6400 before making a more convincing run at 6800.  The current play is to try and sell as close to 6700 as possible and buy back in as close to 6200 as you can.   This is obviously a risky trade and assumes that there will be a right shoulder.  If you can't keep an eye on the  volume  all day - I recommend you don't try this.   If you are waiting to buy in with USD - I would aim for the 6200-6300 range. 

I don't think we will drop below 6000 - there is a possibility that we trace back to this level in the short term  before we make a more convincing rally - but we will more likely band around 6200-6300 for a day or two before we change directions.

Downtrend  wedge  has broken in 3rd attempt and now its heading forward, but the  rsi  is still overbrought region in 4hr chart so, it takes a heel as i mentioned.

It isn't often that I do multiple simultaneous analysis on the same coin, but when I do, that's when you know something big is happening.  Bitcoin              looks great!  Bitcoin              is trading right at the side-wards support line, and does look quite  bullish . Price did yesterday correct back to the horizontal  support zone  exactly as my previous analysis predicted (See related ideas below for more details of my previous analysis), price had  candlestick  reversal candles when it hit the side-wards support and it really does look as though the upside is possible. I know that price is now likely to go up, but the question now simply is, WHERE. 

There is 2 ways this trade will play out: 

-  Bitcoin              trades up and hits the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then breaks down once to the side-wards support once again, before finally having sufficient momentum to go to the upside. 

-  Bitcoin              trades higher, breaks the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then uses the first horizontal  resistance zone  as a  support level , before then going to the higher horizontal  resistance zone  between 7230 and 7360. 

Bear in mind, whichever scenario plays out, price will probably find minor/retest resistance at the 200 major moving average resistance at 6700 before the new up move begins. 

I will update this idea if it receives sufficient attention.

Warning: I'm relatively new to TA and this is not a financial advice. Do your own research before doing any trades. This idea is just my perspective on current market. 
After a bounce on June 29th,  Bitcoin              now faces convergence of resistance: an ascending  wedge  resistance, 7000$ big even level and vicinity of 50 day  SMA , which is very close to 7000 as well. We're at 6 of 9 on daily sequential, so there is a little room to upside. A breakout on July 8th on a daily 9 after failing to break 7000 with  volume  confirmation might take us back to vicinity of mid to low 6200s, but notice:  wedge  pattern is not looking perfect and may not be valid.

6769 is a line of high resistance. Price will have to enter and break the triangular area formed by the resistance line (red), ascending  wedge  (cyan) and the medium term channel (green). This is required to maintain  bullish  momentum. I am not optimist since the current price action is  fractal  of this whole bear market. Once this critical area is saved, a big green candle or sustained buying pressure must be maintained to break the ascending  wedge  upwards.  

Today I expect sideways or more up . Given the current market climate, going down to a new lower low or -higher low- is more likely than going up within the next week.

 BTC 0.14%  has been moving sideways for some time. 

We have seen the price bottom in the 5700s twice before moving back up to our current price. 

If you look at my previous chart - I almost perfectly predicted our current price and time. 

The major resistance points are 6800 and 7200 - we need to break through 6800 in a convincing fashion before we move into the 7200 range and up from there.  The current pattern is showing a reversal of trend for the immediate short term. 

The Bottom Line 

Bitcoin 0.14%  is set for a minor correction.  Judging by the current pattern and the amount of buy pressure it looks like we will form a right shoulder around 6200-6300.  I expect to move sideways as we clear out the resistance at 6400 before making a more convincing run at 6800.  The current play is to try and sell as close to 6700 as possible and buy back in as close to 6200 as you can.   This is obviously a risky trade and assumes that there will be a right shoulder.  If you can't keep an eye on the  volume  all day - I recommend you don't try this.   If you are waiting to buy in with USD - I would aim for the 6200-6300 range. 

I don't think we will drop below 6000 - there is a possibility that we trace back to this level in the short term  before we make a more convincing rally - but we will more likely band around 6200-6300 for a day or two before we change directions.

Downtrend  wedge  has broken in 3rd attempt and now its heading forward, but the  rsi  is still overbrought region in 4hr chart so, it takes a heel as i mentioned.

It isn't often that I do multiple simultaneous analysis on the same coin, but when I do, that's when you know something big is happening.  Bitcoin 0.15%  looks great!  Bitcoin 0.15%  is trading right at the side-wards support line, and does look quite  bullish . Price did yesterday correct back to the horizontal  support zone  exactly as my previous analysis predicted (See related ideas below for more details of my previous analysis), price had  candlestick  reversal candles when it hit the side-wards support and it really does look as though the upside is possible. I know that price is now likely to go up, but the question now simply is, WHERE. 

There is 2 ways this trade will play out: 

-  Bitcoin 0.15%  trades up and hits the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then breaks down once to the side-wards support once again, before finally having sufficient momentum to go to the upside. 

-  Bitcoin 0.15%  trades higher, breaks the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then uses the first horizontal  resistance zone  as a  support level , before then going to the higher horizontal  resistance zone  between 7230 and 7360. 

Bear in mind, whichever scenario plays out, price will probably find minor/retest resistance at the 200 major moving average resistance at 6700 before the new up move begins. 

I will update this idea if it receives sufficient attention.

-  Bitcoin 0.29%  trades up and hits the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then breaks down once to the side-wards support once again, before finally having sufficient momentum to go to the upside. 

-  Bitcoin 0.29%  trades higher, breaks the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then uses the first horizontal  resistance zone  as a  support level , before then going to the higher horizontal  resistance zone  between 7230 and 7360. 

Bear in mind, whichever scenario plays out, price will probably find minor/retest resistance at the 200 major moving average resistance at 6700 before the new up move begins. 

I will update this idea if it receives sufficient attention.

Warning: I'm relatively new to TA and this is not a financial advice. Do your own research before doing any trades. This idea is just my perspective on current market. 
After a bounce on June 29th,  Bitcoin 0.27%  now faces convergence of resistance: an ascending  wedge  resistance, 7000$ big even level and vicinity of 50 day  SMA , which is very close to 7000 as well. We're at 6 of 9 on daily sequential, so there is a little room to upside. A breakout on July 8th on a daily 9 after failing to break 7000 with  volume  confirmation might take us back to vicinity of mid to low 6200s, but notice:  wedge  pattern is not looking perfect and may not be valid.

6769 is a line of high resistance. Price will have to enter and break the triangular area formed by the resistance line (red), ascending  wedge  (cyan) and the medium term channel (green). This is required to maintain  bullish  momentum. I am not optimist since the current price action is  fractal  of this whole bear market. Once this critical area is saved, a big green candle or sustained buying pressure must be maintained to break the ascending  wedge  upwards.  

Today I expect sideways or more up . Given the current market climate, going down to a new lower low or -higher low- is more likely than going up within the next week.

 BTC 0.27%  has been moving sideways for some time. 

We have seen the price bottom in the 5700s twice before moving back up to our current price. 

If you look at my previous chart - I almost perfectly predicted our current price and time. 

The major resistance points are 6800 and 7200 - we need to break through 6800 in a convincing fashion before we move into the 7200 range and up from there.  The current pattern is showing a reversal of trend for the immediate short term. 

The Bottom Line 

Bitcoin 0.27%  is set for a minor correction.  Judging by the current pattern and the amount of buy pressure it looks like we will form a right shoulder around 6200-6300.  I expect to move sideways as we clear out the resistance at 6400 before making a more convincing run at 6800.  The current play is to try and sell as close to 6700 as possible and buy back in as close to 6200 as you can.   This is obviously a risky trade and assumes that there will be a right shoulder.  If you can't keep an eye on the  volume  all day - I recommend you don't try this.   If you are waiting to buy in with USD - I would aim for the 6200-6300 range. 

I don't think we will drop below 6000 - there is a possibility that we trace back to this level in the short term  before we make a more convincing rally - but we will more likely band around 6200-6300 for a day or two before we change directions.

Downtrend  wedge  has broken in 3rd attempt and now its heading forward, but the  rsi  is still overbrought region in 4hr chart so, it takes a heel as i mentioned.

It isn't often that I do multiple simultaneous analysis on the same coin, but when I do, that's when you know something big is happening.  Bitcoin 0.27%  looks great!  Bitcoin 0.27%  is trading right at the side-wards support line, and does look quite  bullish . Price did yesterday correct back to the horizontal  support zone  exactly as my previous analysis predicted (See related ideas below for more details of my previous analysis), price had  candlestick  reversal candles when it hit the side-wards support and it really does look as though the upside is possible. I know that price is now likely to go up, but the question now simply is, WHERE.

It isn't often that I do multiple simultaneous analysis on the same coin, but when I do, that's when you know something big is happening.  Bitcoin 0.16%  looks great!  Bitcoin 0.16%  is trading right at the side-wards support line, and does look quite  bullish . Price did yesterday correct back to the horizontal  support zone  exactly as my previous analysis predicted (See related ideas below for more details of my previous analysis), price had  candlestick  reversal candles when it hit the side-wards support and it really does look as though the upside is possible. I know that price is now likely to go up, but the question now simply is, WHERE. 

There is 2 ways this trade will play out: 

-  Bitcoin 0.16%  trades up and hits the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then breaks down once to the side-wards support once again, before finally having sufficient momentum to go to the upside. 

-  Bitcoin 0.16%  trades higher, breaks the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then uses the first horizontal  resistance zone  as a  support level , before then going to the higher horizontal  resistance zone  between 7230 and 7360. 

Bear in mind, whichever scenario plays out, price will probably find minor/retest resistance at the 200 major moving average resistance at 6700 before the new up move begins. 

I will update this idea if it receives sufficient attention.

Warning: I'm relatively new to TA and this is not a financial advice. Do your own research before doing any trades. This idea is just my perspective on current market. 
After a bounce on June 29th,  Bitcoin 0.15%  now faces convergence of resistance: an ascending  wedge  resistance, 7000$ big even level and vicinity of 50 day  SMA , which is very close to 7000 as well. We're at 6 of 9 on daily sequential, so there is a little room to upside. A breakout on July 8th on a daily 9 after failing to break 7000 with  volume  confirmation might take us back to vicinity of mid to low 6200s, but notice:  wedge  pattern is not looking perfect and may not be valid.

6769 is a line of high resistance. Price will have to enter and break the triangular area formed by the resistance line (red), ascending  wedge  (cyan) and the medium term channel (green). This is required to maintain  bullish  momentum. I am not optimist since the current price action is  fractal  of this whole bear market. Once this critical area is saved, a big green candle or sustained buying pressure must be maintained to break the ascending  wedge  upwards.  

Today I expect sideways or more up . Given the current market climate, going down to a new lower low or -higher low- is more likely than going up within the next week.

 BTC 0.15%  has been moving sideways for some time. 

We have seen the price bottom in the 5700s twice before moving back up to our current price. 

If you look at my previous chart - I almost perfectly predicted our current price and time. 

The major resistance points are 6800 and 7200 - we need to break through 6800 in a convincing fashion before we move into the 7200 range and up from there.  The current pattern is showing a reversal of trend for the immediate short term. 

The Bottom Line 

Bitcoin 0.15%  is set for a minor correction.  Judging by the current pattern and the amount of buy pressure it looks like we will form a right shoulder around 6200-6300.  I expect to move sideways as we clear out the resistance at 6400 before making a more convincing run at 6800.  The current play is to try and sell as close to 6700 as possible and buy back in as close to 6200 as you can.   This is obviously a risky trade and assumes that there will be a right shoulder.  If you can't keep an eye on the  volume  all day - I recommend you don't try this.   If you are waiting to buy in with USD - I would aim for the 6200-6300 range. 

I don't think we will drop below 6000 - there is a possibility that we trace back to this level in the short term  before we make a more convincing rally - but we will more likely band around 6200-6300 for a day or two before we change directions.

It isn't often that I do multiple simultaneous analysis on the same coin, but when I do, that's when you know something big is happening.  Bitcoin -0.05%  looks great!  Bitcoin -0.05%  is trading right at the side-wards support line, and does look quite  bullish . Price did yesterday correct back to the horizontal  support zone  exactly as my previous analysis predicted (See related ideas below for more details of my previous analysis), price had  candlestick  reversal candles when it hit the side-wards support and it really does look as though the upside is possible. I know that price is now likely to go up, but the question now simply is, WHERE. 

There is 2 ways this trade will play out: 

-  Bitcoin -0.05%  trades up and hits the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then breaks down once to the side-wards support once again, before finally having sufficient momentum to go to the upside. 

-  Bitcoin -0.05%  trades higher, breaks the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then uses the first horizontal  resistance zone  as a  support level , before then going to the higher horizontal  resistance zone  between 7230 and 7360. 

Bear in mind, whichever scenario plays out, price will probably find minor/retest resistance at the 200 major moving average resistance at 6700 before the new up move begins. 

I will update this idea if it receives sufficient attention.

Warning: I'm relatively new to TA and this is not a financial advice. Do your own research before doing any trades. This idea is just my perspective on current market. 
After a bounce on June 29th,  Bitcoin 0.02%  now faces convergence of resistance: an ascending  wedge  resistance, 7000$ big even level and vicinity of 50 day  SMA , which is very close to 7000 as well. We're at 6 of 9 on daily sequential, so there is a little room to upside. A breakout on July 8th on a daily 9 after failing to break 7000 with  volume  confirmation might take us back to vicinity of mid to low 6200s, but notice:  wedge  pattern is not looking perfect and may not be valid.

6769 is a line of high resistance. Price will have to enter and break the triangular area formed by the resistance line (red), ascending  wedge  (cyan) and the medium term channel (green). This is required to maintain  bullish  momentum. I am not optimist since the current price action is  fractal  of this whole bear market. Once this critical area is saved, a big green candle or sustained buying pressure must be maintained to break the ascending  wedge  upwards.  

Today I expect sideways or more up . Given the current market climate, going down to a new lower low or -higher low- is more likely than going up within the next week.

 BTC -0.15%  has been moving sideways for some time. 

We have seen the price bottom in the 5700s twice before moving back up to our current price. 

If you look at my previous chart - I almost perfectly predicted our current price and time. 

The major resistance points are 6800 and 7200 - we need to break through 6800 in a convincing fashion before we move into the 7200 range and up from there.  The current pattern is showing a reversal of trend for the immediate short term. 

The Bottom Line 

Bitcoin -0.15%  is set for a minor correction.  Judging by the current pattern and the amount of buy pressure it looks like we will form a right shoulder around 6200-6300.  I expect to move sideways as we clear out the resistance at 6400 before making a more convincing run at 6800.  The current play is to try and sell as close to 6700 as possible and buy back in as close to 6200 as you can.   This is obviously a risky trade and assumes that there will be a right shoulder.  If you can't keep an eye on the  volume  all day - I recommend you don't try this.   If you are waiting to buy in with USD - I would aim for the 6200-6300 range. 

I don't think we will drop below 6000 - there is a possibility that we trace back to this level in the short term  before we make a more convincing rally - but we will more likely band around 6200-6300 for a day or two before we change directions.

The major resistance points are 6800 and 7200 - we need to break through 6800 in a convincing fashion before we move into the 7200 range and up from there.  The current pattern is showing a reversal of trend for the immediate short term. 

The Bottom Line 

Bitcoin -0.30%  is set for a minor correction.  Judging by the current pattern and the amount of buy pressure it looks like we will form a right shoulder around 6200-6300.  I expect to move sideways as we clear out the resistance at 6400 before making a more convincing run at 6800.  The current play is to try and sell as close to 6700 as possible and buy back in as close to 6200 as you can.   This is obviously a risky trade and assumes that there will be a right shoulder.  If you can't keep an eye on the  volume  all day - I recommend you don't try this.   If you are waiting to buy in with USD - I would aim for the 6200-6300 range. 

I don't think we will drop below 6000 - there is a possibility that we trace back to this level in the short term  before we make a more convincing rally - but we will more likely band around 6200-6300 for a day or two before we change directions.

It isn't often that I do multiple simultaneous analysis on the same coin, but when I do, that's when you know something big is happening.  Bitcoin -0.17%  looks great!  Bitcoin -0.17%  is trading right at the side-wards support line, and does look quite  bullish . Price did yesterday correct back to the horizontal  support zone  exactly as my previous analysis predicted (See related ideas below for more details of my previous analysis), price had  candlestick  reversal candles when it hit the side-wards support and it really does look as though the upside is possible. I know that price is now likely to go up, but the question now simply is, WHERE. 

There is 2 ways this trade will play out: 

-  Bitcoin -0.17%  trades up and hits the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then breaks down once to the side-wards support once again, before finally having sufficient momentum to go to the upside. 

-  Bitcoin -0.17%  trades higher, breaks the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then uses the first horizontal  resistance zone  as a  support level , before then going to the higher horizontal  resistance zone  between 7230 and 7360. 

Bear in mind, whichever scenario plays out, price will probably find minor/retest resistance at the 200 major moving average resistance at 6700 before the new up move begins. 

I will update this idea if it receives sufficient attention.

Warning: I'm relatively new to TA and this is not a financial advice. Do your own research before doing any trades. This idea is just my perspective on current market. 
After a bounce on June 29th,  Bitcoin -0.17%  now faces convergence of resistance: an ascending  wedge  resistance, 7000$ big even level and vicinity of 50 day  SMA , which is very close to 7000 as well. We're at 6 of 9 on daily sequential, so there is a little room to upside. A breakout on July 8th on a daily 9 after failing to break 7000 with  volume  confirmation might take us back to vicinity of mid to low 6200s, but notice:  wedge  pattern is not looking perfect and may not be valid.

6769 is a line of high resistance. Price will have to enter and break the triangular area formed by the resistance line (red), ascending  wedge  (cyan) and the medium term channel (green). This is required to maintain  bullish  momentum. I am not optimist since the current price action is  fractal  of this whole bear market. Once this critical area is saved, a big green candle or sustained buying pressure must be maintained to break the ascending  wedge  upwards.  

Today I expect sideways or more up . Given the current market climate, going down to a new lower low or -higher low- is more likely than going up within the next week.

 BTC -0.17%  has been moving sideways for some time. 

We have seen the price bottom in the 5700s twice before moving back up to our current price. 

If you look at my previous chart - I almost perfectly predicted our current price and time. 

The major resistance points are 6800 and 7200 - we need to break through 6800 in a convincing fashion before we move into the 7200 range and up from there.  The current pattern is showing a reversal of trend for the immediate short term. 

The Bottom Line 

Bitcoin -0.17%  is set for a minor correction.  Judging by the current pattern and the amount of buy pressure it looks like we will form a right shoulder around 6200-6300.  I expect to move sideways as we clear out the resistance at 6400 before making a more convincing run at 6800.  The current play is to try and sell as close to 6700 as possible and buy back in as close to 6200 as you can.   This is obviously a risky trade and assumes that there will be a right shoulder.  If you can't keep an eye on the  volume  all day - I recommend you don't try this.   If you are waiting to buy in with USD - I would aim for the 6200-6300 range. 

I don't think we will drop below 6000 - there is a possibility that we trace back to this level in the short term  before we make a more convincing rally - but we will more likely band around 6200-6300 for a day or two before we change directions.

Downtrend  wedge  has broken in 3rd attempt and now its heading forward, but the  rsi  is still overbrought region in 4hr chart so, it takes a heel as i mentioned.

It isn't often that I do multiple simultaneous analysis on the same coin, but when I do, that's when you know something big is happening.  Bitcoin -0.22%  looks great!  Bitcoin -0.22%  is trading right at the side-wards support line, and does look quite  bullish . Price did yesterday correct back to the horizontal  support zone  exactly as my previous analysis predicted (See related ideas below for more details of my previous analysis), price had  candlestick  reversal candles when it hit the side-wards support and it really does look as though the upside is possible. I know that price is now likely to go up, but the question now simply is, WHERE. 

There is 2 ways this trade will play out: 

-  Bitcoin -0.22%  trades up and hits the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then breaks down once to the side-wards support once again, before finally having sufficient momentum to go to the upside. 

-  Bitcoin -0.22%  trades higher, breaks the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then uses the first horizontal  resistance zone  as a  support level , before then going to the higher horizontal  resistance zone  between 7230 and 7360. 

Bear in mind, whichever scenario plays out, price will probably find minor/retest resistance at the 200 major moving average resistance at 6700 before the new up move begins. 

I will update this idea if it receives sufficient attention.

Warning: I'm relatively new to TA and this is not a financial advice. Do your own research before doing any trades. This idea is just my perspective on current market. 
After a bounce on June 29th,  Bitcoin              now faces convergence of resistance: an ascending  wedge  resistance, 7000$ big even level and vicinity of 50 day  SMA , which is very close to 7000 as well. We're at 6 of 9 on daily sequential, so there is a little room to upside. A breakout on July 8th on a daily 9 after failing to break 7000 with  volume  confirmation might take us back to vicinity of mid to low 6200s, but notice:  wedge  pattern is not looking perfect and may not be valid.

6769 is a line of high resistance. Price will have to enter and break the triangular area formed by the resistance line (red), ascending  wedge  (cyan) and the medium term channel (green). This is required to maintain  bullish  momentum. I am not optimist since the current price action is  fractal  of this whole bear market. Once this critical area is saved, a big green candle or sustained buying pressure must be maintained to break the ascending  wedge  upwards.  

Today I expect sideways or more up . Given the current market climate, going down to a new lower low or -higher low- is more likely than going up within the next week.

After a bounce on June 29th,  Bitcoin 0.03%  now faces convergence of resistance: an ascending  wedge  resistance, 7000$ big even level and vicinity of 50 day  SMA , which is very close to 7000 as well. We're at 6 of 9 on daily sequential, so there is a little room to upside. A breakout on July 8th on a daily 9 after failing to break 7000 with  volume  confirmation might take us back to vicinity of mid to low 6200s, but notice:  wedge  pattern is not looking perfect and may not be valid.

6769 is a line of high resistance. Price will have to enter and break the triangular area formed by the resistance line (red), ascending  wedge  (cyan) and the medium term channel (green). This is required to maintain  bullish  momentum. I am not optimist since the current price action is  fractal  of this whole bear market. Once this critical area is saved, a big green candle or sustained buying pressure must be maintained to break the ascending  wedge  upwards.  

Today I expect sideways or more up . Given the current market climate, going down to a new lower low or -higher low- is more likely than going up within the next week.

 BTC 0.03%  has been moving sideways for some time. 

We have seen the price bottom in the 5700s twice before moving back up to our current price. 

If you look at my previous chart - I almost perfectly predicted our current price and time. 

The major resistance points are 6800 and 7200 - we need to break through 6800 in a convincing fashion before we move into the 7200 range and up from there.  The current pattern is showing a reversal of trend for the immediate short term. 

The Bottom Line 

Bitcoin 0.03%  is set for a minor correction.  Judging by the current pattern and the amount of buy pressure it looks like we will form a right shoulder around 6200-6300.  I expect to move sideways as we clear out the resistance at 6400 before making a more convincing run at 6800.  The current play is to try and sell as close to 6700 as possible and buy back in as close to 6200 as you can.   This is obviously a risky trade and assumes that there will be a right shoulder.  If you can't keep an eye on the  volume  all day - I recommend you don't try this.   If you are waiting to buy in with USD - I would aim for the 6200-6300 range. 

I don't think we will drop below 6000 - there is a possibility that we trace back to this level in the short term  before we make a more convincing rally - but we will more likely band around 6200-6300 for a day or two before we change directions.

It isn't often that I do multiple simultaneous analysis on the same coin, but when I do, that's when you know something big is happening.  Bitcoin 0.03%  looks great!  Bitcoin 0.03%  is trading right at the side-wards support line, and does look quite  bullish . Price did yesterday correct back to the horizontal  support zone  exactly as my previous analysis predicted (See related ideas below for more details of my previous analysis), price had  candlestick  reversal candles when it hit the side-wards support and it really does look as though the upside is possible. I know that price is now likely to go up, but the question now simply is, WHERE. 

There is 2 ways this trade will play out: 

-  Bitcoin 0.03%  trades up and hits the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then breaks down once to the side-wards support once again, before finally having sufficient momentum to go to the upside. 

-  Bitcoin 0.03%  trades higher, breaks the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then uses the first horizontal  resistance zone  as a  support level , before then going to the higher horizontal  resistance zone  between 7230 and 7360. 

Bear in mind, whichever scenario plays out, price will probably find minor/retest resistance at the 200 major moving average resistance at 6700 before the new up move begins. 

I will update this idea if it receives sufficient attention.

Warning: I'm relatively new to TA and this is not a financial advice. Do your own research before doing any trades. This idea is just my perspective on current market. 
After a bounce on June 29th,  Bitcoin -0.14%  now faces convergence of resistance: an ascending  wedge  resistance, 7000$ big even level and vicinity of 50 day  SMA , which is very close to 7000 as well. We're at 6 of 9 on daily sequential, so there is a little room to upside. A breakout on July 8th on a daily 9 after failing to break 7000 with  volume  confirmation might take us back to vicinity of mid to low 6200s, but notice:  wedge  pattern is not looking perfect and may not be valid.

6769 is a line of high resistance. Price will have to enter and break the triangular area formed by the resistance line (red), ascending  wedge  (cyan) and the medium term channel (green). This is required to maintain  bullish  momentum. I am not optimist since the current price action is  fractal  of this whole bear market. Once this critical area is saved, a big green candle or sustained buying pressure must be maintained to break the ascending  wedge  upwards.  

Today I expect sideways or more up . Given the current market climate, going down to a new lower low or -higher low- is more likely than going up within the next week.

 BTC -0.14%  has been moving sideways for some time. 

We have seen the price bottom in the 5700s twice before moving back up to our current price. 

If you look at my previous chart - I almost perfectly predicted our current price and time. 

The major resistance points are 6800 and 7200 - we need to break through 6800 in a convincing fashion before we move into the 7200 range and up from there.  The current pattern is showing a reversal of trend for the immediate short term. 

The Bottom Line 

Bitcoin -0.14%  is set for a minor correction.  Judging by the current pattern and the amount of buy pressure it looks like we will form a right shoulder around 6200-6300.  I expect to move sideways as we clear out the resistance at 6400 before making a more convincing run at 6800.  The current play is to try and sell as close to 6700 as possible and buy back in as close to 6200 as you can.   This is obviously a risky trade and assumes that there will be a right shoulder.  If you can't keep an eye on the  volume  all day - I recommend you don't try this.   If you are waiting to buy in with USD - I would aim for the 6200-6300 range. 

I don't think we will drop below 6000 - there is a possibility that we trace back to this level in the short term  before we make a more convincing rally - but we will more likely band around 6200-6300 for a day or two before we change directions.

Downtrend  wedge  has broken in 3rd attempt and now its heading forward, but the  rsi  is still overbrought region in 4hr chart so, it takes a heel as i mentioned.

It isn't often that I do multiple simultaneous analysis on the same coin, but when I do, that's when you know something big is happening.  Bitcoin -0.14%  looks great!  Bitcoin -0.14%  is trading right at the side-wards support line, and does look quite  bullish . Price did yesterday correct back to the horizontal  support zone  exactly as my previous analysis predicted (See related ideas below for more details of my previous analysis), price had  candlestick  reversal candles when it hit the side-wards support and it really does look as though the upside is possible. I know that price is now likely to go up, but the question now simply is, WHERE. 

There is 2 ways this trade will play out: 

-  Bitcoin -0.14%  trades up and hits the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then breaks down once to the side-wards support once again, before finally having sufficient momentum to go to the upside. 

-  Bitcoin -0.14%  trades higher, breaks the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then uses the first horizontal  resistance zone  as a  support level , before then going to the higher horizontal  resistance zone  between 7230 and 7360. 

Bear in mind, whichever scenario plays out, price will probably find minor/retest resistance at the 200 major moving average resistance at 6700 before the new up move begins. 

I will update this idea if it receives sufficient attention.

-  Bitcoin 0.00%  trades up and hits the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then breaks down once to the side-wards support once again, before finally having sufficient momentum to go to the upside. 

-  Bitcoin 0.00%  trades higher, breaks the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then uses the first horizontal  resistance zone  as a  support level , before then going to the higher horizontal  resistance zone  between 7230 and 7360. 

Bear in mind, whichever scenario plays out, price will probably find minor/retest resistance at the 200 major moving average resistance at 6700 before the new up move begins. 

I will update this idea if it receives sufficient attention.

Warning: I'm relatively new to TA and this is not a financial advice. Do your own research before doing any trades. This idea is just my perspective on current market. 
After a bounce on June 29th,  Bitcoin 0.00%  now faces convergence of resistance: an ascending  wedge  resistance, 7000$ big even level and vicinity of 50 day  SMA , which is very close to 7000 as well. We're at 6 of 9 on daily sequential, so there is a little room to upside. A breakout on July 8th on a daily 9 after failing to break 7000 with  volume  confirmation might take us back to vicinity of mid to low 6200s, but notice:  wedge  pattern is not looking perfect and may not be valid.

6769 is a line of high resistance. Price will have to enter and break the triangular area formed by the resistance line (red), ascending  wedge  (cyan) and the medium term channel (green). This is required to maintain  bullish  momentum. I am not optimist since the current price action is  fractal  of this whole bear market. Once this critical area is saved, a big green candle or sustained buying pressure must be maintained to break the ascending  wedge  upwards.  

Today I expect sideways or more up . Given the current market climate, going down to a new lower low or -higher low- is more likely than going up within the next week.

 BTC 0.00%  has been moving sideways for some time. 

We have seen the price bottom in the 5700s twice before moving back up to our current price. 

If you look at my previous chart - I almost perfectly predicted our current price and time. 

The major resistance points are 6800 and 7200 - we need to break through 6800 in a convincing fashion before we move into the 7200 range and up from there.  The current pattern is showing a reversal of trend for the immediate short term. 

The Bottom Line 

Bitcoin 0.00%  is set for a minor correction.  Judging by the current pattern and the amount of buy pressure it looks like we will form a right shoulder around 6200-6300.  I expect to move sideways as we clear out the resistance at 6400 before making a more convincing run at 6800.  The current play is to try and sell as close to 6700 as possible and buy back in as close to 6200 as you can.   This is obviously a risky trade and assumes that there will be a right shoulder.  If you can't keep an eye on the  volume  all day - I recommend you don't try this.   If you are waiting to buy in with USD - I would aim for the 6200-6300 range. 

I don't think we will drop below 6000 - there is a possibility that we trace back to this level in the short term  before we make a more convincing rally - but we will more likely band around 6200-6300 for a day or two before we change directions.

Downtrend  wedge  has broken in 3rd attempt and now its heading forward, but the  rsi  is still overbrought region in 4hr chart so, it takes a heel as i mentioned.

It isn't often that I do multiple simultaneous analysis on the same coin, but when I do, that's when you know something big is happening.  Bitcoin 0.00%  looks great!  Bitcoin 0.00%  is trading right at the side-wards support line, and does look quite  bullish . Price did yesterday correct back to the horizontal  support zone  exactly as my previous analysis predicted (See related ideas below for more details of my previous analysis), price had  candlestick  reversal candles when it hit the side-wards support and it really does look as though the upside is possible. I know that price is now likely to go up, but the question now simply is, WHERE.

It isn't often that I do multiple simultaneous analysis on the same coin, but when I do, that's when you know something big is happening.  Bitcoin 0.02%  looks great!  Bitcoin 0.02%  is trading right at the side-wards support line, and does look quite  bullish . Price did yesterday correct back to the horizontal  support zone  exactly as my previous analysis predicted (See related ideas below for more details of my previous analysis), price had  candlestick  reversal candles when it hit the side-wards support and it really does look as though the upside is possible. I know that price is now likely to go up, but the question now simply is, WHERE. 

There is 2 ways this trade will play out: 

-  Bitcoin 0.02%  trades up and hits the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then breaks down once to the side-wards support once again, before finally having sufficient momentum to go to the upside. 

-  Bitcoin 0.02%  trades higher, breaks the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then uses the first horizontal  resistance zone  as a  support level , before then going to the higher horizontal  resistance zone  between 7230 and 7360. 

Bear in mind, whichever scenario plays out, price will probably find minor/retest resistance at the 200 major moving average resistance at 6700 before the new up move begins. 

I will update this idea if it receives sufficient attention.

Warning: I'm relatively new to TA and this is not a financial advice. Do your own research before doing any trades. This idea is just my perspective on current market. 
After a bounce on June 29th,  Bitcoin -0.06%  now faces convergence of resistance: an ascending  wedge  resistance, 7000$ big even level and vicinity of 50 day  SMA , which is very close to 7000 as well. We're at 6 of 9 on daily sequential, so there is a little room to upside. A breakout on July 8th on a daily 9 after failing to break 7000 with  volume  confirmation might take us back to vicinity of mid to low 6200s, but notice:  wedge  pattern is not looking perfect and may not be valid.

6769 is a line of high resistance. Price will have to enter and break the triangular area formed by the resistance line (red), ascending  wedge  (cyan) and the medium term channel (green). This is required to maintain  bullish  momentum. I am not optimist since the current price action is  fractal  of this whole bear market. Once this critical area is saved, a big green candle or sustained buying pressure must be maintained to break the ascending  wedge  upwards.  

Today I expect sideways or more up . Given the current market climate, going down to a new lower low or -higher low- is more likely than going up within the next week.

 BTC -0.17%  has been moving sideways for some time. 

We have seen the price bottom in the 5700s twice before moving back up to our current price. 

If you look at my previous chart - I almost perfectly predicted our current price and time. 

The major resistance points are 6800 and 7200 - we need to break through 6800 in a convincing fashion before we move into the 7200 range and up from there.  The current pattern is showing a reversal of trend for the immediate short term. 

The Bottom Line 

Bitcoin -0.17%  is set for a minor correction.  Judging by the current pattern and the amount of buy pressure it looks like we will form a right shoulder around 6200-6300.  I expect to move sideways as we clear out the resistance at 6400 before making a more convincing run at 6800.  The current play is to try and sell as close to 6700 as possible and buy back in as close to 6200 as you can.   This is obviously a risky trade and assumes that there will be a right shoulder.  If you can't keep an eye on the  volume  all day - I recommend you don't try this.   If you are waiting to buy in with USD - I would aim for the 6200-6300 range. 

I don't think we will drop below 6000 - there is a possibility that we trace back to this level in the short term  before we make a more convincing rally - but we will more likely band around 6200-6300 for a day or two before we change directions.

It isn't often that I do multiple simultaneous analysis on the same coin, but when I do, that's when you know something big is happening.  Bitcoin              looks great!  Bitcoin              is trading right at the side-wards support line, and does look quite  bullish . Price did yesterday correct back to the horizontal  support zone  exactly as my previous analysis predicted (See related ideas below for more details of my previous analysis), price had  candlestick  reversal candles when it hit the side-wards support and it really does look as though the upside is possible. I know that price is now likely to go up, but the question now simply is, WHERE. 

There is 2 ways this trade will play out: 

-  Bitcoin              trades up and hits the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then breaks down once to the side-wards support once again, before finally having sufficient momentum to go to the upside. 

-  Bitcoin              trades higher, breaks the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then uses the first horizontal  resistance zone  as a  support level , before then going to the higher horizontal  resistance zone  between 7230 and 7360. 

Bear in mind, whichever scenario plays out, price will probably find minor/retest resistance at the 200 major moving average resistance at 6700 before the new up move begins. 

I will update this idea if it receives sufficient attention.

Warning: I'm relatively new to TA and this is not a financial advice. Do your own research before doing any trades. This idea is just my perspective on current market. 
After a bounce on June 29th,  Bitcoin 0.14%  now faces convergence of resistance: an ascending  wedge  resistance, 7000$ big even level and vicinity of 50 day  SMA , which is very close to 7000 as well. We're at 6 of 9 on daily sequential, so there is a little room to upside. A breakout on July 8th on a daily 9 after failing to break 7000 with  volume  confirmation might take us back to vicinity of mid to low 6200s, but notice:  wedge  pattern is not looking perfect and may not be valid.

6769 is a line of high resistance. Price will have to enter and break the triangular area formed by the resistance line (red), ascending  wedge  (cyan) and the medium term channel (green). This is required to maintain  bullish  momentum. I am not optimist since the current price action is  fractal  of this whole bear market. Once this critical area is saved, a big green candle or sustained buying pressure must be maintained to break the ascending  wedge  upwards.  

Today I expect sideways or more up . Given the current market climate, going down to a new lower low or -higher low- is more likely than going up within the next week.

 BTC 0.29%  has been moving sideways for some time. 

We have seen the price bottom in the 5700s twice before moving back up to our current price. 

If you look at my previous chart - I almost perfectly predicted our current price and time. 

The major resistance points are 6800 and 7200 - we need to break through 6800 in a convincing fashion before we move into the 7200 range and up from there.  The current pattern is showing a reversal of trend for the immediate short term. 

The Bottom Line 

Bitcoin 0.29%  is set for a minor correction.  Judging by the current pattern and the amount of buy pressure it looks like we will form a right shoulder around 6200-6300.  I expect to move sideways as we clear out the resistance at 6400 before making a more convincing run at 6800.  The current play is to try and sell as close to 6700 as possible and buy back in as close to 6200 as you can.   This is obviously a risky trade and assumes that there will be a right shoulder.  If you can't keep an eye on the  volume  all day - I recommend you don't try this.   If you are waiting to buy in with USD - I would aim for the 6200-6300 range. 

I don't think we will drop below 6000 - there is a possibility that we trace back to this level in the short term  before we make a more convincing rally - but we will more likely band around 6200-6300 for a day or two before we change directions.

The major resistance points are 6800 and 7200 - we need to break through 6800 in a convincing fashion before we move into the 7200 range and up from there.  The current pattern is showing a reversal of trend for the immediate short term. 

The Bottom Line 

Bitcoin 0.17%  is set for a minor correction.  Judging by the current pattern and the amount of buy pressure it looks like we will form a right shoulder around 6200-6300.  I expect to move sideways as we clear out the resistance at 6400 before making a more convincing run at 6800.  The current play is to try and sell as close to 6700 as possible and buy back in as close to 6200 as you can.   This is obviously a risky trade and assumes that there will be a right shoulder.  If you can't keep an eye on the  volume  all day - I recommend you don't try this.   If you are waiting to buy in with USD - I would aim for the 6200-6300 range. 

I don't think we will drop below 6000 - there is a possibility that we trace back to this level in the short term  before we make a more convincing rally - but we will more likely band around 6200-6300 for a day or two before we change directions.

It isn't often that I do multiple simultaneous analysis on the same coin, but when I do, that's when you know something big is happening.  Bitcoin 0.24%  looks great!  Bitcoin 0.24%  is trading right at the side-wards support line, and does look quite  bullish . Price did yesterday correct back to the horizontal  support zone  exactly as my previous analysis predicted (See related ideas below for more details of my previous analysis), price had  candlestick  reversal candles when it hit the side-wards support and it really does look as though the upside is possible. I know that price is now likely to go up, but the question now simply is, WHERE. 

There is 2 ways this trade will play out: 

-  Bitcoin 0.24%  trades up and hits the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then breaks down once to the side-wards support once again, before finally having sufficient momentum to go to the upside. 

-  Bitcoin 0.24%  trades higher, breaks the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then uses the first horizontal  resistance zone  as a  support level , before then going to the higher horizontal  resistance zone  between 7230 and 7360. 

Bear in mind, whichever scenario plays out, price will probably find minor/retest resistance at the 200 major moving average resistance at 6700 before the new up move begins. 

I will update this idea if it receives sufficient attention.

Warning: I'm relatively new to TA and this is not a financial advice. Do your own research before doing any trades. This idea is just my perspective on current market. 
After a bounce on June 29th,  Bitcoin 0.32%  now faces convergence of resistance: an ascending  wedge  resistance, 7000$ big even level and vicinity of 50 day  SMA , which is very close to 7000 as well. We're at 6 of 9 on daily sequential, so there is a little room to upside. A breakout on July 8th on a daily 9 after failing to break 7000 with  volume  confirmation might take us back to vicinity of mid to low 6200s, but notice:  wedge  pattern is not looking perfect and may not be valid.

6769 is a line of high resistance. Price will have to enter and break the triangular area formed by the resistance line (red), ascending  wedge  (cyan) and the medium term channel (green). This is required to maintain  bullish  momentum. I am not optimist since the current price action is  fractal  of this whole bear market. Once this critical area is saved, a big green candle or sustained buying pressure must be maintained to break the ascending  wedge  upwards.  

Today I expect sideways or more up . Given the current market climate, going down to a new lower low or -higher low- is more likely than going up within the next week.

 BTC 0.08%  has been moving sideways for some time. 

We have seen the price bottom in the 5700s twice before moving back up to our current price. 

If you look at my previous chart - I almost perfectly predicted our current price and time. 

The major resistance points are 6800 and 7200 - we need to break through 6800 in a convincing fashion before we move into the 7200 range and up from there.  The current pattern is showing a reversal of trend for the immediate short term. 

The Bottom Line 

Bitcoin 0.08%  is set for a minor correction.  Judging by the current pattern and the amount of buy pressure it looks like we will form a right shoulder around 6200-6300.  I expect to move sideways as we clear out the resistance at 6400 before making a more convincing run at 6800.  The current play is to try and sell as close to 6700 as possible and buy back in as close to 6200 as you can.   This is obviously a risky trade and assumes that there will be a right shoulder.  If you can't keep an eye on the  volume  all day - I recommend you don't try this.   If you are waiting to buy in with USD - I would aim for the 6200-6300 range. 

I don't think we will drop below 6000 - there is a possibility that we trace back to this level in the short term  before we make a more convincing rally - but we will more likely band around 6200-6300 for a day or two before we change directions.

Downtrend  wedge  has broken in 3rd attempt and now its heading forward, but the  rsi  is still overbrought region in 4hr chart so, it takes a heel as i mentioned.

It isn't often that I do multiple simultaneous analysis on the same coin, but when I do, that's when you know something big is happening.  Bitcoin 0.08%  looks great!  Bitcoin 0.08%  is trading right at the side-wards support line, and does look quite  bullish . Price did yesterday correct back to the horizontal  support zone  exactly as my previous analysis predicted (See related ideas below for more details of my previous analysis), price had  candlestick  reversal candles when it hit the side-wards support and it really does look as though the upside is possible. I know that price is now likely to go up, but the question now simply is, WHERE. 

There is 2 ways this trade will play out: 

-  Bitcoin 0.08%  trades up and hits the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then breaks down once to the side-wards support once again, before finally having sufficient momentum to go to the upside. 

-  Bitcoin 0.08%  trades higher, breaks the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then uses the first horizontal  resistance zone  as a  support level , before then going to the higher horizontal  resistance zone  between 7230 and 7360. 

Bear in mind, whichever scenario plays out, price will probably find minor/retest resistance at the 200 major moving average resistance at 6700 before the new up move begins. 

I will update this idea if it receives sufficient attention.

Warning: I'm relatively new to TA and this is not a financial advice. Do your own research before doing any trades. This idea is just my perspective on current market. 
After a bounce on June 29th,  Bitcoin 0.08%  now faces convergence of resistance: an ascending  wedge  resistance, 7000$ big even level and vicinity of 50 day  SMA , which is very close to 7000 as well. We're at 6 of 9 on daily sequential, so there is a little room to upside. A breakout on July 8th on a daily 9 after failing to break 7000 with  volume  confirmation might take us back to vicinity of mid to low 6200s, but notice:  wedge  pattern is not looking perfect and may not be valid.

6769 is a line of high resistance. Price will have to enter and break the triangular area formed by the resistance line (red), ascending  wedge  (cyan) and the medium term channel (green). This is required to maintain  bullish  momentum. I am not optimist since the current price action is  fractal  of this whole bear market. Once this critical area is saved, a big green candle or sustained buying pressure must be maintained to break the ascending  wedge  upwards.  

Today I expect sideways or more up . Given the current market climate, going down to a new lower low or -higher low- is more likely than going up within the next week.

After a bounce on June 29th,  Bitcoin 0.08%  now faces convergence of resistance: an ascending  wedge  resistance, 7000$ big even level and vicinity of 50 day  SMA , which is very close to 7000 as well. We're at 6 of 9 on daily sequential, so there is a little room to upside.

6769 is a line of high resistance. Price will have to enter and break the triangular area formed by the resistance line (red), ascending  wedge  (cyan) and the medium term channel (green). This is required to maintain  bullish  momentum. I am not optimist since the current price action is  fractal  of this whole bear market. Once this critical area is saved, a big green candle or sustained buying pressure must be maintained to break the ascending  wedge  upwards.  

Today I expect sideways or more up . Given the current market climate, going down to a new lower low or -higher low- is more likely than going up within the next week.

 BTC 0.08%  has been moving sideways for some time. 

We have seen the price bottom in the 5700s twice before moving back up to our current price. 

If you look at my previous chart - I almost perfectly predicted our current price and time. 

The major resistance points are 6800 and 7200 - we need to break through 6800 in a convincing fashion before we move into the 7200 range and up from there.  The current pattern is showing a reversal of trend for the immediate short term. 

The Bottom Line 

Bitcoin 0.08%  is set for a minor correction.  Judging by the current pattern and the amount of buy pressure it looks like we will form a right shoulder around 6200-6300.  I expect to move sideways as we clear out the resistance at 6400 before making a more convincing run at 6800.  The current play is to try and sell as close to 6700 as possible and buy back in as close to 6200 as you can.   This is obviously a risky trade and assumes that there will be a right shoulder.  If you can't keep an eye on the  volume  all day - I recommend you don't try this.   If you are waiting to buy in with USD - I would aim for the 6200-6300 range. 

I don't think we will drop below 6000 - there is a possibility that we trace back to this level in the short term  before we make a more convincing rally - but we will more likely band around 6200-6300 for a day or two before we change directions.

It isn't often that I do multiple simultaneous analysis on the same coin, but when I do, that's when you know something big is happening.  Bitcoin 0.08%  looks great!  Bitcoin 0.08%  is trading right at the side-wards support line, and does look quite  bullish . Price did yesterday correct back to the horizontal  support zone  exactly as my previous analysis predicted (See related ideas below for more details of my previous analysis), price had  candlestick  reversal candles when it hit the side-wards support and it really does look as though the upside is possible. I know that price is now likely to go up, but the question now simply is, WHERE. 

There is 2 ways this trade will play out: 

-  Bitcoin 0.08%  trades up and hits the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then breaks down once to the side-wards support once again, before finally having sufficient momentum to go to the upside. 

-  Bitcoin 0.08%  trades higher, breaks the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then uses the first horizontal  resistance zone  as a  support level , before then going to the higher horizontal  resistance zone  between 7230 and 7360. 

Bear in mind, whichever scenario plays out, price will probably find minor/retest resistance at the 200 major moving average resistance at 6700 before the new up move begins. 

I will update this idea if it receives sufficient attention.

Warning: I'm relatively new to TA and this is not a financial advice. Do your own research before doing any trades. This idea is just my perspective on current market. 
After a bounce on June 29th,  Bitcoin 0.08%  now faces convergence of resistance: an ascending  wedge  resistance, 7000$ big even level and vicinity of 50 day  SMA , which is very close to 7000 as well. We're at 6 of 9 on daily sequential, so there is a little room to upside. A breakout on July 8th on a daily 9 after failing to break 7000 with  volume  confirmation might take us back to vicinity of mid to low 6200s, but notice:  wedge  pattern is not looking perfect and may not be valid.

6769 is a line of high resistance. Price will have to enter and break the triangular area formed by the resistance line (red), ascending  wedge  (cyan) and the medium term channel (green). This is required to maintain  bullish  momentum. I am not optimist since the current price action is  fractal  of this whole bear market. Once this critical area is saved, a big green candle or sustained buying pressure must be maintained to break the ascending  wedge  upwards.  

Today I expect sideways or more up . Given the current market climate, going down to a new lower low or -higher low- is more likely than going up within the next week.

 BTC 0.13%  has been moving sideways for some time. 

We have seen the price bottom in the 5700s twice before moving back up to our current price. 

If you look at my previous chart - I almost perfectly predicted our current price and time. 

The major resistance points are 6800 and 7200 - we need to break through 6800 in a convincing fashion before we move into the 7200 range and up from there.  The current pattern is showing a reversal of trend for the immediate short term. 

The Bottom Line 

Bitcoin 0.13%  is set for a minor correction.  Judging by the current pattern and the amount of buy pressure it looks like we will form a right shoulder around 6200-6300.  I expect to move sideways as we clear out the resistance at 6400 before making a more convincing run at 6800.  The current play is to try and sell as close to 6700 as possible and buy back in as close to 6200 as you can.   This is obviously a risky trade and assumes that there will be a right shoulder.  If you can't keep an eye on the  volume  all day - I recommend you don't try this.   If you are waiting to buy in with USD - I would aim for the 6200-6300 range. 

I don't think we will drop below 6000 - there is a possibility that we trace back to this level in the short term  before we make a more convincing rally - but we will more likely band around 6200-6300 for a day or two before we change directions.

It isn't often that I do multiple simultaneous analysis on the same coin, but when I do, that's when you know something big is happening.  Bitcoin              looks great!  Bitcoin              is trading right at the side-wards support line, and does look quite  bullish . Price did yesterday correct back to the horizontal  support zone  exactly as my previous analysis predicted (See related ideas below for more details of my previous analysis), price had  candlestick  reversal candles when it hit the side-wards support and it really does look as though the upside is possible. I know that price is now likely to go up, but the question now simply is, WHERE. 

There is 2 ways this trade will play out: 

-  Bitcoin              trades up and hits the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then breaks down once to the side-wards support once again, before finally having sufficient momentum to go to the upside. 

-  Bitcoin              trades higher, breaks the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then uses the first horizontal  resistance zone  as a  support level , before then going to the higher horizontal  resistance zone  between 7230 and 7360. 

Bear in mind, whichever scenario plays out, price will probably find minor/retest resistance at the 200 major moving average resistance at 6700 before the new up move begins. 

I will update this idea if it receives sufficient attention.

Bitcoin 0.19%  is trading right at the side-wards support line, and does look quite  bullish . Price did yesterday correct back to the horizontal  support zone  exactly as my previous analysis predicted (See related ideas below for more details of my previous analysis), price had  candlestick  reversal candles when it hit the side-wards support and it really does look as though the upside is possible. I know that price is now likely to go up, but the question now simply is, WHERE. 

There is 2 ways this trade will play out: 

-  Bitcoin 0.19%  trades up and hits the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then breaks down once to the side-wards support once again, before finally having sufficient momentum to go to the upside. 

-  Bitcoin 0.19%  trades higher, breaks the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then uses the first horizontal  resistance zone  as a  support level , before then going to the higher horizontal  resistance zone  between 7230 and 7360. 

Bear in mind, whichever scenario plays out, price will probably find minor/retest resistance at the 200 major moving average resistance at 6700 before the new up move begins. 

I will update this idea if it receives sufficient attention.

Warning: I'm relatively new to TA and this is not a financial advice. Do your own research before doing any trades. This idea is just my perspective on current market. 
After a bounce on June 29th,  Bitcoin 0.19%  now faces convergence of resistance: an ascending  wedge  resistance, 7000$ big even level and vicinity of 50 day  SMA , which is very close to 7000 as well. We're at 6 of 9 on daily sequential, so there is a little room to upside. A breakout on July 8th on a daily 9 after failing to break 7000 with  volume  confirmation might take us back to vicinity of mid to low 6200s, but notice:  wedge  pattern is not looking perfect and may not be valid.

6769 is a line of high resistance. Price will have to enter and break the triangular area formed by the resistance line (red), ascending  wedge  (cyan) and the medium term channel (green). This is required to maintain  bullish  momentum. I am not optimist since the current price action is  fractal  of this whole bear market. Once this critical area is saved, a big green candle or sustained buying pressure must be maintained to break the ascending  wedge  upwards.  

Today I expect sideways or more up . Given the current market climate, going down to a new lower low or -higher low- is more likely than going up within the next week.

 BTC 0.20%  has been moving sideways for some time. 

We have seen the price bottom in the 5700s twice before moving back up to our current price. 

If you look at my previous chart - I almost perfectly predicted our current price and time. 

The major resistance points are 6800 and 7200 - we need to break through 6800 in a convincing fashion before we move into the 7200 range and up from there.  The current pattern is showing a reversal of trend for the immediate short term. 

The Bottom Line 

Bitcoin 0.20%  is set for a minor correction.  Judging by the current pattern and the amount of buy pressure it looks like we will form a right shoulder around 6200-6300.  I expect to move sideways as we clear out the resistance at 6400 before making a more convincing run at 6800.  The current play is to try and sell as close to 6700 as possible and buy back in as close to 6200 as you can.   This is obviously a risky trade and assumes that there will be a right shoulder.  If you can't keep an eye on the  volume  all day - I recommend you don't try this.   If you are waiting to buy in with USD - I would aim for the 6200-6300 range. 

I don't think we will drop below 6000 - there is a possibility that we trace back to this level in the short term  before we make a more convincing rally - but we will more likely band around 6200-6300 for a day or two before we change directions.

Expecting the same movement as done before 2 times in 48 hours gapb before two big green candles.  
Downtrend  wedge  has broken in 3rd attempt and now its heading forward, but the  rsi  is still overbrought region in 4hr chart so, it takes a heel as i mentioned.

Downtrend  wedge  has broken in 3rd attempt and now its heading forward, but the  rsi  is still overbrought region in 4hr chart so, it takes a heel as i mentioned.

It isn't often that I do multiple simultaneous analysis on the same coin, but when I do, that's when you know something big is happening.  Bitcoin 0.20%  looks great!  Bitcoin 0.20%  is trading right at the side-wards support line, and does look quite  bullish . Price did yesterday correct back to the horizontal  support zone  exactly as my previous analysis predicted (See related ideas below for more details of my previous analysis), price had  candlestick  reversal candles when it hit the side-wards support and it really does look as though the upside is possible. I know that price is now likely to go up, but the question now simply is, WHERE. 

There is 2 ways this trade will play out: 

-  Bitcoin 0.20%  trades up and hits the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then breaks down once to the side-wards support once again, before finally having sufficient momentum to go to the upside. 

-  Bitcoin 0.20%  trades higher, breaks the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then uses the first horizontal  resistance zone  as a  support level , before then going to the higher horizontal  resistance zone  between 7230 and 7360. 

Bear in mind, whichever scenario plays out, price will probably find minor/retest resistance at the 200 major moving average resistance at 6700 before the new up move begins. 

I will update this idea if it receives sufficient attention.

Warning: I'm relatively new to TA and this is not a financial advice. Do your own research before doing any trades. This idea is just my perspective on current market. 
After a bounce on June 29th,  Bitcoin 0.19%  now faces convergence of resistance: an ascending  wedge  resistance, 7000$ big even level and vicinity of 50 day  SMA , which is very close to 7000 as well. We're at 6 of 9 on daily sequential, so there is a little room to upside. A breakout on July 8th on a daily 9 after failing to break 7000 with  volume  confirmation might take us back to vicinity of mid to low 6200s, but notice:  wedge  pattern is not looking perfect and may not be valid.

6769 is a line of high resistance. Price will have to enter and break the triangular area formed by the resistance line (red), ascending  wedge  (cyan) and the medium term channel (green). This is required to maintain  bullish  momentum. I am not optimist since the current price action is  fractal  of this whole bear market. Once this critical area is saved, a big green candle or sustained buying pressure must be maintained to break the ascending  wedge  upwards.  

Today I expect sideways or more up . Given the current market climate, going down to a new lower low or -higher low- is more likely than going up within the next week.

 BTC 0.18%  has been moving sideways for some time. 

We have seen the price bottom in the 5700s twice before moving back up to our current price. 

If you look at my previous chart - I almost perfectly predicted our current price and time. 

The major resistance points are 6800 and 7200 - we need to break through 6800 in a convincing fashion before we move into the 7200 range and up from there.  The current pattern is showing a reversal of trend for the immediate short term. 

The Bottom Line 

Bitcoin 0.18%  is set for a minor correction.  Judging by the current pattern and the amount of buy pressure it looks like we will form a right shoulder around 6200-6300.  I expect to move sideways as we clear out the resistance at 6400 before making a more convincing run at 6800.  The current play is to try and sell as close to 6700 as possible and buy back in as close to 6200 as you can.   This is obviously a risky trade and assumes that there will be a right shoulder.  If you can't keep an eye on the  volume  all day - I recommend you don't try this.   If you are waiting to buy in with USD - I would aim for the 6200-6300 range. 

I don't think we will drop below 6000 - there is a possibility that we trace back to this level in the short term  before we make a more convincing rally - but we will more likely band around 6200-6300 for a day or two before we change directions.

Bitcoin 0.08%  is set for a minor correction.  Judging by the current pattern and the amount of buy pressure it looks like we will form a right shoulder around 6200-6300.  I expect to move sideways as we clear out the resistance at 6400 before making a more convincing run at 6800.  The current play is to try and sell as close to 6700 as possible and buy back in as close to 6200 as you can.   This is obviously a risky trade and assumes that there will be a right shoulder.  If you can't keep an eye on the  volume  all day - I recommend you don't try this.   If you are waiting to buy in with USD - I would aim for the 6200-6300 range. 

I don't think we will drop below 6000 - there is a possibility that we trace back to this level in the short term  before we make a more convincing rally - but we will more likely band around 6200-6300 for a day or two before we change directions.

It isn't often that I do multiple simultaneous analysis on the same coin, but when I do, that's when you know something big is happening.  Bitcoin 0.08%  looks great!  Bitcoin 0.08%  is trading right at the side-wards support line, and does look quite  bullish . Price did yesterday correct back to the horizontal  support zone  exactly as my previous analysis predicted (See related ideas below for more details of my previous analysis), price had  candlestick  reversal candles when it hit the side-wards support and it really does look as though the upside is possible. I know that price is now likely to go up, but the question now simply is, WHERE. 

There is 2 ways this trade will play out: 

-  Bitcoin 0.08%  trades up and hits the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then breaks down once to the side-wards support once again, before finally having sufficient momentum to go to the upside. 

-  Bitcoin 0.08%  trades higher, breaks the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then uses the first horizontal  resistance zone  as a  support level , before then going to the higher horizontal  resistance zone  between 7230 and 7360. 

Bear in mind, whichever scenario plays out, price will probably find minor/retest resistance at the 200 major moving average resistance at 6700 before the new up move begins. 

I will update this idea if it receives sufficient attention.

Warning: I'm relatively new to TA and this is not a financial advice. Do your own research before doing any trades. This idea is just my perspective on current market. 
After a bounce on June 29th,  Bitcoin 0.08%  now faces convergence of resistance: an ascending  wedge  resistance, 7000$ big even level and vicinity of 50 day  SMA , which is very close to 7000 as well. We're at 6 of 9 on daily sequential, so there is a little room to upside. A breakout on July 8th on a daily 9 after failing to break 7000 with  volume  confirmation might take us back to vicinity of mid to low 6200s, but notice:  wedge  pattern is not looking perfect and may not be valid.

6769 is a line of high resistance. Price will have to enter and break the triangular area formed by the resistance line (red), ascending  wedge  (cyan) and the medium term channel (green). This is required to maintain  bullish  momentum. I am not optimist since the current price action is  fractal  of this whole bear market. Once this critical area is saved, a big green candle or sustained buying pressure must be maintained to break the ascending  wedge  upwards.  

Today I expect sideways or more up . Given the current market climate, going down to a new lower low or -higher low- is more likely than going up within the next week.

 BTC 0.08%  has been moving sideways for some time. 

We have seen the price bottom in the 5700s twice before moving back up to our current price. 

If you look at my previous chart - I almost perfectly predicted our current price and time. 

The major resistance points are 6800 and 7200 - we need to break through 6800 in a convincing fashion before we move into the 7200 range and up from there.  The current pattern is showing a reversal of trend for the immediate short term.

 BTC 0.09%  has been moving sideways for some time. 

We have seen the price bottom in the 5700s twice before moving back up to our current price. 

If you look at my previous chart - I almost perfectly predicted our current price and time. 

The major resistance points are 6800 and 7200 - we need to break through 6800 in a convincing fashion before we move into the 7200 range and up from there.  The current pattern is showing a reversal of trend for the immediate short term. 

The Bottom Line 

Bitcoin 0.09%  is set for a minor correction.  Judging by the current pattern and the amount of buy pressure it looks like we will form a right shoulder around 6200-6300.  I expect to move sideways as we clear out the resistance at 6400 before making a more convincing run at 6800.  The current play is to try and sell as close to 6700 as possible and buy back in as close to 6200 as you can.   This is obviously a risky trade and assumes that there will be a right shoulder.  If you can't keep an eye on the  volume  all day - I recommend you don't try this.   If you are waiting to buy in with USD - I would aim for the 6200-6300 range. 

I don't think we will drop below 6000 - there is a possibility that we trace back to this level in the short term  before we make a more convincing rally - but we will more likely band around 6200-6300 for a day or two before we change directions.

Expecting the same movement as done before 2 times in 48 hours gapb before two big green candles.  
Downtrend  wedge  has broken in 3rd attempt and now its heading forward, but the  rsi  is still overbrought region in 4hr chart so, it takes a heel as i mentioned.  
i am expecting sideways for more than 24 hours from now, than again we will see a big green candle that will break the heading resistance

It isn't often that I do multiple simultaneous analysis on the same coin, but when I do, that's when you know something big is happening.  Bitcoin 0.09%  looks great!  Bitcoin 0.09%  is trading right at the side-wards support line, and does look quite  bullish . Price did yesterday correct back to the horizontal  support zone  exactly as my previous analysis predicted (See related ideas below for more details of my previous analysis), price had  candlestick  reversal candles when it hit the side-wards support and it really does look as though the upside is possible. I know that price is now likely to go up, but the question now simply is, WHERE. 

There is 2 ways this trade will play out: 

-  Bitcoin 0.09%  trades up and hits the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then breaks down once to the side-wards support once again, before finally having sufficient momentum to go to the upside. 

-  Bitcoin 0.09%  trades higher, breaks the first horizontal  resistance zone  between 6800 and 6910, then uses the first horizontal  resistance zone  as a  support level , before then going to the higher horizontal  resistance zone  between 7230 and 7360. 

Bear in mind, whichever scenario plays out, price will probably find minor/retest resistance at the 200 major moving average resistance at 6700 before the new up move begins. 

I will update this idea if it receives sufficient attention.

EMA9 has crossed above SMA30 and staying above it which is confirmed  bullish  indicator. The  rising wedge  is a concern but can invalidate if goes above $6850 . I have marked possible  support and resistance . Overall I am  bullish .

Warning: I'm relatively new to TA and this is not a financial advice. Do your own research before doing any trades. This idea is just my perspective on current market. 
After a bounce on June 29th,  Bitcoin 0.09%  now faces convergence of resistance: an ascending  wedge  resistance, 7000$ big even level and vicinity of 50 day  SMA , which is very close to 7000 as well. We're at 6 of 9 on daily sequential, so there is a little room to upside. A breakout on July 8th on a daily 9 after failing to break 7000 with  volume  confirmation might take us back to vicinity of mid to low 6200s, but notice:  wedge  pattern is not looking perfect and may not be valid.

6769 is a line of high resistance. Price will have to enter and break the triangular area formed by the resistance line (red), ascending  wedge  (cyan) and the medium term channel (green). This is required to maintain  bullish  momentum. I am not optimist since the current price action is  fractal  of this whole bear market. Once this critical area is saved, a big green candle or sustained buying pressure must be maintained to break the ascending  wedge  upwards.  

Today I expect sideways or more up . Given the current market climate, going down to a new lower low or -higher low- is more likely than going up within the next week.
