1530775571.0,TARIFOREX,Let's buy some LTC,"
Hi guys,  

the price just broke the channel, plus we have a very good trend inversion signal. 

The 3 Mobile Avarage crossed giving us a good entry point. The oscillator crossed 50%, so this is another signal to hope in a new uptrend. 

Target @170, Risk Reward ratio is very nice, around 7-9 times the Stopl Loss, to set around @72. 

Enjoy your wallet!

1530775108.0,OctaFX_Official,LTCUSD ONLY INTRADAY BULLISH ABOVE $85,"
Litecoin is starting to consolidate around the $83.50 level in early Thursday trading, after multiple technical rejections from the key $85  resistance area . 

The intraday sentiment towards the  LTCUSD -0.73%  pair is starting to turn  bearish , after price created a  bearish  double-top pattern. 

Sellers will now try to break the $81  support level , while buyers will look to move price above the $85  resistance level  once again. 

The  LTCUSD -0.73%  pair is only intraday  bullish  while trading above the $85 level, further upside towards the $87 and $88 levels remains possible. 

If the  LTCUSD -0.73%  pair moves below the $81 level, price may start to move back towards the $79.70 and $77 support levels.
