If you have been following  BTC -0.43%  the last few weeks you have probably been accumulating for the long haul. 

In the short term the market still has not made a decision as to which way it wants to go (other than continue sideways). 

If the current pattern breaks through the downtrend line we are likely going to 5700. 

So how should you trade it? 

If you watch  BTC -0.43%  all day - there is likely and excellent short opportunity as the right side of the pattern plays out.   

Some people ask what the point of TA since it seems to be vague.  The point is to arm you with the knowledge you need to make the best possible decision based on what we can see.  We all have to wait for confirmation of pattens before trading - otherwise we are trading on ""hunches"".   We know that  BTC -0.43%  will trade above these levels again - so its really a race to the bottom to try and wrestle the best price out of someones hands. 

If we are in a true  H&S  pattern it will bring us down to the 5000s - it makes sense to set your stop below the right shoulder - if we see a breakout your stop is never triggered - and if we see a major downtrend you''ll be in a good stop to pickup more  BTC -0.43% . 

Im forever  bullish  on  BTC -0.43%  but it is starting to look like we are going down before we start testing the higher resistance levels again.

through my analysis of  btcusd -0.43%  and numerous hours of back testing I can see that  btcusd -0.43%  may make its way back up. it has been coming down in recent weeks but there have not been any violent drops in the days past and also a lot of consolidation periods. i would like to think that  btcusd -0.43%  will make its way back up slowly over the next few and days and possibly even more consolidation periods.

 Bitcoin -0.43%  found the low at $5777, but it didn't stay there long. Straight after price jumped u by nearly 10%, hitting $6340 high. Such a massive buy pressure might suggest that this is a very important price for the  Bitcoin -0.43%  that could result in a strong fight between bulls and bears. 

Fibonacci, applied to the last corrective wave up, shows that 127.2% Fibs at $5946 still plays an important role ans it has acted as the  support and resistance  already. Looking at the current corrective wave down, BTC/USD found the support at $5992, and rejected it. 

Overall, the key  support area  is located between $5946 and $5992, which makes a $6k a very interesting area, concerting a long term price development of the  Bitcoin -0.43% . At this point there are some clues about the potential price reversal to the upside, but this is only if there will be no daily close below the $5946. And if  Bitcoin -0.43%  will break below, further decline will be extremely likely, and price could reach $5k, $4k and even $3k in the mid to long term.
