Ok, so this post might seem ridiculous, but hear me out. We've seen this repeatable pattern of breaking resistance, extreme growth, and then a following consolidation and new resistance formed many times now, and it's conceivable that when we break resistance this time around, we'll see another period of extreme growth followed by consolidation and new resistance... etc. 

So how does this play out practically speaking, based on what we've already observed? 

This video is highly speculative, of course- but it's in fun, and the market is boring right now, so why not. I'll save this link and revisit it a year and a half from now from my villa in South of France since we're dreaming. 

I'll create an accompanying trade idea so we can all follow and laugh at me (or with joy if you hold XRP)
