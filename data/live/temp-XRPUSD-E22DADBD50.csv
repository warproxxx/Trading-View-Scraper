1530951275.0,VARZAR_INVESTMENT,Trading plan: XRPUSD (Ripple),"
The Ripple rate fixed under the level of $ 0.485. 
Priority of the day: decrease in the rate of XRPUSD to $ 0.435. 
In our opinion, the price of Ripple has a small potential for a fall, and further a reversal upwards is possible.  
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will drop from $ 0.48 to $ 0.435. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD may please us by being in flat for another day.  
Alternative scenario: 
So far prices are not very good for buyers, so they, in our opinion, will look for opportunities to purchase Ripple in the zone: $ 0.43 - $ 0.40.
