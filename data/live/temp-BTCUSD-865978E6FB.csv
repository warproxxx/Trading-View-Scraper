 BTC -0.55%  will do correction to 6300$, but there is another way of this situation:  BTC -0.55%  can fall to 5900 and after this will go to 1st Wave of  Elliot

Symmetrical triangle building on the  BITFINEX:BTCUSD -0.55%  Hourly charts (1, 4 & 6) entering the second day with expiry in the next 12 hours. Chart is a 4-hour. Current scenarios: 
A) Breakout north above the  resistance level  of $6,800 after initial rejection. (Likely) 
Note: This level has acted as strong resistance for nearly 4 weeks. 
B) Breakout south bouncing off the  support level  of $6,250. 
Note: This would create a  head & shoulders  pattern on the  Daily charts . (Unlikely) 
C) Breakout south crashing through $6,250, $6,000 as well as $5,750 with a target of $5.3-$5.4K.  
Note: This would signal the continuation of down trend. (Likely) 

Summary: Neutral playing field. 
Daily RSI: 50 
Risk: Very high 
Reward: Medium

Looks like we may actually be going down. W formation was in isolation to the long spike earlier that got sold out. Trend is showing a concave formation that may indicate it's drop if the market has normalised.

1530961850.0,EagleView777,BTC/USD - Study of ultimate BTC bottom (Fibonanacci price/time),"
In my previous post I showed the MAIN RESISTANCE/SUPPORT LINE of  BTC -0.58%  price all the way from the very top in December 2017 until now (July 2018). 

Now, here I want to show a study with the help of a Fibonacci Speed Resistance Fan, in order to project a possible ultimate bottom in  BTC -0.58%  with regards to price/time. 

So, starting the Fib Fan from the top in December 2017, I thought I would put the 0.5 point (both 0.5 in price and 0.5 in time) on the green line right at the point in time (mid April 2018) where the green line turned from main resistance line into main support line. Do you think this makes sense? Please feel free to comment. 

And if I do so, then this Fibonacci Fan projects an ultimate bottom in  BTC -0.58%  at a price level just below USD 4,000 in the third week of Augustus 2018. 

If this works out, then from then on I would expect sideways price movement for quite some time, perhaps towards Q4 of 2018. 

Does this make sense? I really don't know. Let's see how it all works out. 

Good luck with trading.

This pattern is comprised of three component parts: 
1. After a long  bullish trend , the price rises to a peak and subsequently declines to form a trough 
2. The price rises again to form a second high substantially above the initial peak and declines again 
3. The price rises a third time, but only to the level of the first peak, before declining once more

1530956892.0,SkyRockSignals,"BTCUSD a comprehensive short, mid and long term analysis","
Short term analysis: 
At the moment, the formation of an ascending  wedge  is happening. The price is inside of the template and moves to the lower edge of it which is located around $6550. The price can bounce from this point, moving to the resistance of $6780, in case of overcoming it there will be a chance to get an impulse breakthrough into the range of $6890-7000 (where it will meet the stronger resistance).  

Bears could not have decreased the price to a lower range since yesterday. However the price is in the red  Ichimoku cloud  and should move to the lower edge of it according to indicators. if it happens the market is fixed below the  wedge  level breaking it down and below the level of $6500, which will start a correction wave. The nearest support in case of a fall will be at the level of $6300. 

Our analysts team thinks that a correction scenario is more likely to happen. 


Mid term analysis:  
The outlook for the next few days for  Bitcoin -0.58%  may look like this. The  BTC -0.58%  value will reduce due to the formation of an ascending  wedge , which will act like a correction of the breakdown of the descending  wedge  with a subsequent increase to the  resistance level . 

Global view on  Bitcoin -0.58% . Considering the 1-month scale, it can be seen that the price heads to the resistance of 0.5 Fib level which is around $10900 according to our previous analysis 
In case of breaking long term pattern and subsequent fall through  support level  in the short and mid term the price will meet Fib 0.786 level which is near $5800 and will act as the main support of the asset for the period of corrective declines.
