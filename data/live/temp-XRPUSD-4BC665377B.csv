HELLO! We're back with a not so educational post suited for you lazy asses who just want buying and selling signals.  
We're sure that many of you guys are confused by the super professional and complicated charts in TradingView. Many of you have questions like  
""So..Nice chart but at what price do we actually buy or sell at?""  
""Elliot's wave, HnS, Green  trendline  , Red  trendline  , Black  trendline  , Support, WHAT ARE THOSE!! I just want to know when to buy and sell..""  
We successfully stopped lost in our previous post before  BTC 0.39%  decided to drop to its current lows. Sorry for the -5%, but as always, we are just guys who read charts, not oracles. Even we lose sometimes! :( . Lets gain back more profits in our next few posts! 

Well fret not, cause we are here to save your lazy asses from googling and learning the ""pro"" terms of TA.  
We will be here to give you guys exact Buying and Selling Signals  

No calls for XRP. Stay out of XRP. 
If you are holding onto XRP, continue holding and only stop loss if  BTC 0.39%  breaks below 6300 USD  
Dont worry, we will be following up more on XRP in our Telegram group. 


On the technical part, we'll cut short the story and tell you why it'll be rising or falling:  
1) XRP fell from $0.80 to its current low.  
2) XRP is very indecisive now, the only thing XRP is waiting for before it moons or drops to hell is the clear directions of  BTC 0.39% .  
3)  BTC 0.39%  is still acting as the absolute dictator, so when  BTC 0.39%  dips, ALTS will follow and they will dip even more then  BTC 0.39% , Vice Versa.  
4) XRP is one of the coins that follows  BTC 0.39%  like a very loyal dog!  BTC 0.39%  dips, XRP dips.  BTC 0.39%  rises, XRP rises. No matter how good of a TA XRP is showing, it'll just follow  BTC 0.39%  0.20% in the end. That is what we realised after getting burned by XRP a few times. Hard coin to call. One example is when  BTC 0.39%  dropped to 6000 USD, XRP dropped to its current low of 0.50 USD. 
5) XRP is just not showing any decisive signs of a revival or a drop. The candles are just moving sideways. We DESPERATELY need  BTC 0.39%  to save XRP. 
6) We will move our position to the sidelines in order to keep our capital safe. It is just not safe to invest into XRP right now. We ADVISE everyone to do so too. 
7) Even though we are not going to be putting money into XRP, we are neither  bullish  nor  bearish . Therefore we suggest you to hold onto your current XRP and only stop loss if  BTC 0.39%  breaks below 6300 USD. 

We will be here for the long run in order to scoop up all the +% for you guys and burn away the -%  
For all the information above, you should be able to understand them as long as you learned how to read and speak english. Our posts are as simple as  ABC  but is probably what all of you came here for, which is to have the exact buying and selling signals.  
More coin signals coming soon.  
The main thing that we'll be doing is that we'll make you guys filthy rich.
