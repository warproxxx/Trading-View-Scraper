The Litecoin rate is in flat. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  LTCUSD 2.78% . 
Today we stick to our forecast of the growth of the Litecoin rate to $ 87. There are no plans to open Litecoin deals today, since the growth of Litecoin is a correction to a downward trend, and we are working on a trend. In addition, in such a flat other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  LTCUSD 2.78%  rate will rise from $ 76 to $ 87. 
2. The  LTCUSD 2.78%  rate will decrease from $ 76 to $ 70. 
An alternative scenario: 
Litecoin in flat is possible for the rest of the day.

Litecoin has tumbled sharply lower in early Wednesday trading, with the  LTCUSD 2.78%  pair now trading below the $75 level and moving to a fresh 2018 trading low, hitting $73.28 

The  LTCUSD 2.78%  pair has now lost close to twelve percent of its value since hitting a weekly trading high of $82.79 

Further heavy technical selling in the  LTCUSD 2.78%  pair remains likely while price trades below the $77  resistance level . 

The  LTCUSD 2.78%  pair is strongly  bearish  while trading below the $75 level, key technical support is now located at the $73.28 and $70 levels. 

If the  LTCUSD 2.78%  pair moves above the $75 level, price may correct back towards the $77 and $78.90 resistance levels.

As you can see, Litecoin is just mere dollars away from breaking below closest critical support; after that, it will be a free-fall to around $50 area, followed by another massive crash that will send it to sub $30 territory. 

Litecoin is a scam; the rise last year was manipulated and anyone who bought it above $100; rest assured, you will never ever make your money back. This is what you get for listening to scammers/ponzi scheme promoters. Litecoin has no real world use and might get delisted from Coinbase. 

Remember, the creator of Litecoin actually advised against buying it and sold all his coins at the top! 

During the last bear market, LTC performed worst of all coins and crashed 97% from its  ATH 0.25% . If the same scenario happens again, which so far looks like it does, this will send LTC to $9.70, which I believe is still way too much for this joke coin.

Jun 25




Today we're going to use Zone Analysis on the 15 Minute Chart.  As you can see, we've had two candles enter the Pink Zone.  History tells us we'll need to have at least one candle blast through the Brown Zone for a triple digit finish.  On the other hand, if we see the  SMI Ergodic Indicator  tighten up, the Brown Zone will be almost impossible to penetrate leaving us with a sideways or downward pattern.  We understand most people think Zone Analysis is unreliable, possibly even a little fishy, but we only use the original Formulas and Zones as intended by the original inventors.  Today we're calling for a definite move up, or down (or sideways).

LTC is approaching a key  support level  which intersects with the current downtrend line that it has been retesting as support since may. 

RSI  is completely bottomed out which does suggest the current price trend is running out of strength however in this market that is not a valid reason to go long. 

I will be keeping an eye out to see how LTC will react when the horizontal support meets the diagonal  trend line . My guess would be a sharp decline in price followed by a bounce and we should start to see some upwards price action. 

Ive also drawn some previous support / resistance levels at the sub $70 USD mark.

Today Litecoin has reached the  support level  at $72. This is the 361.8%  Fibonacci retracement  level that has been rejected cleanly. At the same time price has reached the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel , and overall it seems like it could reverse to the upside. 

Nevertheless, there are no confirmations of this happening right away and LTC/USD still could decline lower. It is important to watch the current price action in general and the $72 support in particular. 

If the support will be broken, with the daily close below, price should decline further towards 427.2% Fibs at $57, that also corresponds to the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel . But, if the support will hold, trend reversal could be the case, and price is likely to start moving higher, at least towards the 50% Fibs resistance at $128

Today Litecoin has reached the  support level  at $72. This is the 361.8%  Fibonacci retracement  level that has been rejected cleanly. At the same time price has reached the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel , and overall it seems like it could reverse to the upside. 

Nevertheless, there are no confirmations of this happening right away and LTC/USD still could decline lower. It is important to watch the current price action in general and the $72 support in particular. 

If the support will be broken, with the daily close below, price should decline further towards 427.2% Fibs at $57, that also corresponds to the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel . But, if the support will hold, trend reversal could be the case, and price is likely to start moving higher, at least towards the 50% Fibs resistance at $128

As you can see, Litecoin is just mere dollars away from breaking below closest critical support; after that, it will be a free-fall to around $50 area, followed by another massive crash that will send it to sub $30 territory. 

Litecoin is a scam; the rise last year was manipulated and anyone who bought it above $100; rest assured, you will never ever make your money back. This is what you get for listening to scammers/ponzi scheme promoters. Litecoin has no real world use and might get delisted from Coinbase. 

Remember, the creator of Litecoin actually advised against buying it and sold all his coins at the top! 

During the last bear market, LTC performed worst of all coins and crashed 97% from its  ATH 0.25% . If the same scenario happens again, which so far looks like it does, this will send LTC to $9.70, which I believe is still way too much for this joke coin.

Today we're going to use Zone Analysis on the 15 Minute Chart.  As you can see, we've had two candles enter the Pink Zone.  History tells us we'll need to have at least one candle blast through the Brown Zone for a triple digit finish.  On the other hand, if we see the  SMI Ergodic Indicator  tighten up, the Brown Zone will be almost impossible to penetrate leaving us with a sideways or downward pattern.  We understand most people think Zone Analysis is unreliable, possibly even a little fishy, but we only use the original Formulas and Zones as intended by the original inventors.  Today we're calling for a definite move up, or down (or sideways).

LTC is approaching a key  support level  which intersects with the current downtrend line that it has been retesting as support since may. 

RSI  is completely bottomed out which does suggest the current price trend is running out of strength however in this market that is not a valid reason to go long. 

I will be keeping an eye out to see how LTC will react when the horizontal support meets the diagonal  trend line . My guess would be a sharp decline in price followed by a bounce and we should start to see some upwards price action. 

Ive also drawn some previous support / resistance levels at the sub $70 USD mark.

Today Litecoin has reached the  support level  at $72. This is the 361.8%  Fibonacci retracement  level that has been rejected cleanly. At the same time price has reached the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel , and overall it seems like it could reverse to the upside. 

Nevertheless, there are no confirmations of this happening right away and LTC/USD still could decline lower. It is important to watch the current price action in general and the $72 support in particular. 

If the support will be broken, with the daily close below, price should decline further towards 427.2% Fibs at $57, that also corresponds to the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel . But, if the support will hold, trend reversal could be the case, and price is likely to start moving higher, at least towards the 50% Fibs resistance at $128

As you can see, Litecoin is just mere dollars away from breaking below closest critical support; after that, it will be a free-fall to around $50 area, followed by another massive crash that will send it to sub $30 territory. 

Litecoin is a scam; the rise last year was manipulated and anyone who bought it above $100; rest assured, you will never ever make your money back. This is what you get for listening to scammers/ponzi scheme promoters. Litecoin has no real world use and might get delisted from Coinbase. 

Remember, the creator of Litecoin actually advised against buying it and sold all his coins at the top! 

During the last bear market, LTC performed worst of all coins and crashed 97% from its  ATH             . If the same scenario happens again, which so far looks like it does, this will send LTC to $9.70, which I believe is still way too much for this joke coin.

Today we're going to use Zone Analysis on the 15 Minute Chart.  As you can see, we've had two candles enter the Pink Zone.  History tells us we'll need to have at least one candle blast through the Brown Zone for a triple digit finish.  On the other hand, if we see the  SMI Ergodic Indicator  tighten up, the Brown Zone will be almost impossible to penetrate leaving us with a sideways or downward pattern.  We understand most people think Zone Analysis is unreliable, possibly even a little fishy, but we only use the original Formulas and Zones as intended by the original inventors.  Today we're calling for a definite move up, or down (or sideways).

Today we're going to use Zone Analysis on the 15 Minute Chart.  As you can see, we've had two candles enter the Pink Zone.  History tells us we'll need to have at least one candle blast through the Brown Zone for a triple digit finish.  On the other hand, if we see the  SMI Ergodic Indicator  tighten up, the Brown Zone will be almost impossible to penetrate leaving us with a sideways or downward pattern.  We understand most people think Zone Analysis is unreliable, possibly even a little fishy, but we only use the original Formulas and Zones as intended by the original inventors.  Today we're calling for a definite move up, or down (or sideways).

LTC is approaching a key  support level  which intersects with the current downtrend line that it has been retesting as support since may. 

RSI  is completely bottomed out which does suggest the current price trend is running out of strength however in this market that is not a valid reason to go long. 

I will be keeping an eye out to see how LTC will react when the horizontal support meets the diagonal  trend line . My guess would be a sharp decline in price followed by a bounce and we should start to see some upwards price action. 

Ive also drawn some previous support / resistance levels at the sub $70 USD mark.

Today Litecoin has reached the  support level  at $72. This is the 361.8%  Fibonacci retracement  level that has been rejected cleanly. At the same time price has reached the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel , and overall it seems like it could reverse to the upside. 

Nevertheless, there are no confirmations of this happening right away and LTC/USD still could decline lower. It is important to watch the current price action in general and the $72 support in particular. 

If the support will be broken, with the daily close below, price should decline further towards 427.2% Fibs at $57, that also corresponds to the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel . But, if the support will hold, trend reversal could be the case, and price is likely to start moving higher, at least towards the 50% Fibs resistance at $128

As you can see, Litecoin is just mere dollars away from breaking below closest critical support; after that, it will be a free-fall to around $50 area, followed by another massive crash that will send it to sub $30 territory. 

Litecoin is a scam; the rise last year was manipulated and anyone who bought it above $100; rest assured, you will never ever make your money back. This is what you get for listening to scammers/ponzi scheme promoters. Litecoin has no real world use and might get delisted from Coinbase. 

Remember, the creator of Litecoin actually advised against buying it and sold all his coins at the top! 

During the last bear market, LTC performed worst of all coins and crashed 97% from its  ATH 0.25% . If the same scenario happens again, which so far looks like it does, this will send LTC to $9.70, which I believe is still way too much for this joke coin.

As you can see, Litecoin is just mere dollars away from breaking below closest critical support; after that, it will be a free-fall to around $50 area, followed by another massive crash that will send it to sub $30 territory. 

Litecoin is a scam; the rise last year was manipulated and anyone who bought it above $100; rest assured, you will never ever make your money back. This is what you get for listening to scammers/ponzi scheme promoters. Litecoin has no real world use and might get delisted from Coinbase. 

Remember, the creator of Litecoin actually advised against buying it and sold all his coins at the top! 

During the last bear market, LTC performed worst of all coins and crashed 97% from its  ATH 0.25% . If the same scenario happens again, which so far looks like it does, this will send LTC to $9.70, which I believe is still way too much for this joke coin.

Jun 25




Today we're going to use Zone Analysis on the 15 Minute Chart.  As you can see, we've had two candles enter the Pink Zone.  History tells us we'll need to have at least one candle blast through the Brown Zone for a triple digit finish.  On the other hand, if we see the  SMI Ergodic Indicator  tighten up, the Brown Zone will be almost impossible to penetrate leaving us with a sideways or downward pattern.  We understand most people think Zone Analysis is unreliable, possibly even a little fishy, but we only use the original Formulas and Zones as intended by the original inventors.  Today we're calling for a definite move up, or down (or sideways).

LTC is approaching a key  support level  which intersects with the current downtrend line that it has been retesting as support since may. 

RSI  is completely bottomed out which does suggest the current price trend is running out of strength however in this market that is not a valid reason to go long. 

I will be keeping an eye out to see how LTC will react when the horizontal support meets the diagonal  trend line . My guess would be a sharp decline in price followed by a bounce and we should start to see some upwards price action.

Today Litecoin has reached the  support level  at $72. This is the 361.8%  Fibonacci retracement  level that has been rejected cleanly. At the same time price has reached the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel , and overall it seems like it could reverse to the upside. 

Nevertheless, there are no confirmations of this happening right away and LTC/USD still could decline lower. It is important to watch the current price action in general and the $72 support in particular. 

If the support will be broken, with the daily close below, price should decline further towards 427.2% Fibs at $57, that also corresponds to the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel . But, if the support will hold, trend reversal could be the case, and price is likely to start moving higher, at least towards the 50% Fibs resistance at $128

As you can see, Litecoin is just mere dollars away from breaking below closest critical support; after that, it will be a free-fall to around $50 area, followed by another massive crash that will send it to sub $30 territory. 

Litecoin is a scam; the rise last year was manipulated and anyone who bought it above $100; rest assured, you will never ever make your money back. This is what you get for listening to scammers/ponzi scheme promoters. Litecoin has no real world use and might get delisted from Coinbase. 

Remember, the creator of Litecoin actually advised against buying it and sold all his coins at the top! 

During the last bear market, LTC performed worst of all coins and crashed 97% from its  ATH 0.25% . If the same scenario happens again, which so far looks like it does, this will send LTC to $9.70, which I believe is still way too much for this joke coin.

Today we're going to use Zone Analysis on the 15 Minute Chart.  As you can see, we've had two candles enter the Pink Zone.  History tells us we'll need to have at least one candle blast through the Brown Zone for a triple digit finish.  On the other hand, if we see the  SMI Ergodic Indicator  tighten up, the Brown Zone will be almost impossible to penetrate leaving us with a sideways or downward pattern.  We understand most people think Zone Analysis is unreliable, possibly even a little fishy, but we only use the original Formulas and Zones as intended by the original inventors.  Today we're calling for a definite move up, or down (or sideways).

LTC is approaching a key  support level  which intersects with the current downtrend line that it has been retesting as support since may. 

RSI  is completely bottomed out which does suggest the current price trend is running out of strength however in this market that is not a valid reason to go long. 

I will be keeping an eye out to see how LTC will react when the horizontal support meets the diagonal  trend line . My guess would be a sharp decline in price followed by a bounce and we should start to see some upwards price action. 

Ive also drawn some previous support / resistance levels at the sub $70 USD mark.

Today Litecoin has reached the  support level  at $72. This is the 361.8%  Fibonacci retracement  level that has been rejected cleanly. At the same time price has reached the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel , and overall it seems like it could reverse to the upside. 

Nevertheless, there are no confirmations of this happening right away and LTC/USD still could decline lower. It is important to watch the current price action in general and the $72 support in particular. 

If the support will be broken, with the daily close below, price should decline further towards 427.2% Fibs at $57, that also corresponds to the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel . But, if the support will hold, trend reversal could be the case, and price is likely to start moving higher, at least towards the 50% Fibs resistance at $128

If the support will be broken, with the daily close below, price should decline further towards 427.2% Fibs at $57, that also corresponds to the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel . But, if the support will hold, trend reversal could be the case, and price is likely to start moving higher, at least towards the 50% Fibs resistance at $128

As you can see, Litecoin is just mere dollars away from breaking below closest critical support; after that, it will be a free-fall to around $50 area, followed by another massive crash that will send it to sub $30 territory. 

Litecoin is a scam; the rise last year was manipulated and anyone who bought it above $100; rest assured, you will never ever make your money back. This is what you get for listening to scammers/ponzi scheme promoters. Litecoin has no real world use and might get delisted from Coinbase. 

Remember, the creator of Litecoin actually advised against buying it and sold all his coins at the top! 

During the last bear market, LTC performed worst of all coins and crashed 97% from its  ATH 0.25% . If the same scenario happens again, which so far looks like it does, this will send LTC to $9.70, which I believe is still way too much for this joke coin.

Today we're going to use Zone Analysis on the 15 Minute Chart.  As you can see, we've had two candles enter the Pink Zone.  History tells us we'll need to have at least one candle blast through the Brown Zone for a triple digit finish.  On the other hand, if we see the  SMI Ergodic Indicator  tighten up, the Brown Zone will be almost impossible to penetrate leaving us with a sideways or downward pattern.  We understand most people think Zone Analysis is unreliable, possibly even a little fishy, but we only use the original Formulas and Zones as intended by the original inventors.  Today we're calling for a definite move up, or down (or sideways).

LTC is approaching a key  support level  which intersects with the current downtrend line that it has been retesting as support since may. 

RSI  is completely bottomed out which does suggest the current price trend is running out of strength however in this market that is not a valid reason to go long. 

I will be keeping an eye out to see how LTC will react when the horizontal support meets the diagonal  trend line . My guess would be a sharp decline in price followed by a bounce and we should start to see some upwards price action. 

Ive also drawn some previous support / resistance levels at the sub $70 USD mark.

Today Litecoin has reached the  support level  at $72. This is the 361.8%  Fibonacci retracement  level that has been rejected cleanly. At the same time price has reached the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel , and overall it seems like it could reverse to the upside. 

Nevertheless, there are no confirmations of this happening right away and LTC/USD still could decline lower. It is important to watch the current price action in general and the $72 support in particular. 

If the support will be broken, with the daily close below, price should decline further towards 427.2% Fibs at $57, that also corresponds to the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel . But, if the support will hold, trend reversal could be the case, and price is likely to start moving higher, at least towards the 50% Fibs resistance at $128

As you can see, Litecoin is just mere dollars away from breaking below closest critical support; after that, it will be a free-fall to around $50 area, followed by another massive crash that will send it to sub $30 territory. 

Litecoin is a scam; the rise last year was manipulated and anyone who bought it above $100; rest assured, you will never ever make your money back. This is what you get for listening to scammers/ponzi scheme promoters. Litecoin has no real world use and might get delisted from Coinbase. 

Remember, the creator of Litecoin actually advised against buying it and sold all his coins at the top! 

During the last bear market, LTC performed worst of all coins and crashed 97% from its  ATH 0.25% . If the same scenario happens again, which so far looks like it does, this will send LTC to $9.70, which I believe is still way too much for this joke coin.

Today we're going to use Zone Analysis on the 15 Minute Chart.  As you can see, we've had two candles enter the Pink Zone.  History tells us we'll need to have at least one candle blast through the Brown Zone for a triple digit finish.  On the other hand, if we see the  SMI Ergodic Indicator  tighten up, the Brown Zone will be almost impossible to penetrate leaving us with a sideways or downward pattern.  We understand most people think Zone Analysis is unreliable, possibly even a little fishy, but we only use the original Formulas and Zones as intended by the original inventors.  Today we're calling for a definite move up, or down (or sideways).

Jun 25




Today we're going to use Zone Analysis on the 15 Minute Chart.  As you can see, we've had two candles enter the Pink Zone.  History tells us we'll need to have at least one candle blast through the Brown Zone for a triple digit finish.  On the other hand, if we see the  SMI Ergodic Indicator  tighten up, the Brown Zone will be almost impossible to penetrate leaving us with a sideways or downward pattern.  We understand most people think Zone Analysis is unreliable, possibly even a little fishy, but we only use the original Formulas and Zones as intended by the original inventors.  Today we're calling for a definite move up, or down (or sideways).

LTC is approaching a key  support level  which intersects with the current downtrend line that it has been retesting as support since may. 

RSI  is completely bottomed out which does suggest the current price trend is running out of strength however in this market that is not a valid reason to go long. 

I will be keeping an eye out to see how LTC will react when the horizontal support meets the diagonal  trend line . My guess would be a sharp decline in price followed by a bounce and we should start to see some upwards price action. 

Ive also drawn some previous support / resistance levels at the sub $70 USD mark.

Today Litecoin has reached the  support level  at $72. This is the 361.8%  Fibonacci retracement  level that has been rejected cleanly. At the same time price has reached the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel , and overall it seems like it could reverse to the upside. 

Nevertheless, there are no confirmations of this happening right away and LTC/USD still could decline lower. It is important to watch the current price action in general and the $72 support in particular. 

If the support will be broken, with the daily close below, price should decline further towards 427.2% Fibs at $57, that also corresponds to the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel . But, if the support will hold, trend reversal could be the case, and price is likely to start moving higher, at least towards the 50% Fibs resistance at $128

As you can see, Litecoin is just mere dollars away from breaking below closest critical support; after that, it will be a free-fall to around $50 area, followed by another massive crash that will send it to sub $30 territory. 

Litecoin is a scam; the rise last year was manipulated and anyone who bought it above $100; rest assured, you will never ever make your money back. This is what you get for listening to scammers/ponzi scheme promoters. Litecoin has no real world use and might get delisted from Coinbase. 

Remember, the creator of Litecoin actually advised against buying it and sold all his coins at the top! 

During the last bear market, LTC performed worst of all coins and crashed 97% from its  ATH 0.25% . If the same scenario happens again, which so far looks like it does, this will send LTC to $9.70, which I believe is still way too much for this joke coin.

As you can see, Litecoin is just mere dollars away from breaking below closest critical support; after that, it will be a free-fall to around $50 area, followed by another massive crash that will send it to sub $30 territory. 

Litecoin is a scam; the rise last year was manipulated and anyone who bought it above $100; rest assured, you will never ever make your money back. This is what you get for listening to scammers/ponzi scheme promoters. Litecoin has no real world use and might get delisted from Coinbase. 

Remember, the creator of Litecoin actually advised against buying it and sold all his coins at the top! 

During the last bear market, LTC performed worst of all coins and crashed 97% from its  ATH 0.25% . If the same scenario happens again, which so far looks like it does, this will send LTC to $9.70, which I believe is still way too much for this joke coin.

Jun 25




Today we're going to use Zone Analysis on the 15 Minute Chart.  As you can see, we've had two candles enter the Pink Zone.  History tells us we'll need to have at least one candle blast through the Brown Zone for a triple digit finish.  On the other hand, if we see the  SMI Ergodic Indicator  tighten up, the Brown Zone will be almost impossible to penetrate leaving us with a sideways or downward pattern.  We understand most people think Zone Analysis is unreliable, possibly even a little fishy, but we only use the original Formulas and Zones as intended by the original inventors.  Today we're calling for a definite move up, or down (or sideways).

LTC is approaching a key  support level  which intersects with the current downtrend line that it has been retesting as support since may. 

RSI  is completely bottomed out which does suggest the current price trend is running out of strength however in this market that is not a valid reason to go long. 

I will be keeping an eye out to see how LTC will react when the horizontal support meets the diagonal  trend line . My guess would be a sharp decline in price followed by a bounce and we should start to see some upwards price action.

Today Litecoin has reached the  support level  at $72. This is the 361.8%  Fibonacci retracement  level that has been rejected cleanly. At the same time price has reached the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel , and overall it seems like it could reverse to the upside. 

Nevertheless, there are no confirmations of this happening right away and LTC/USD still could decline lower. It is important to watch the current price action in general and the $72 support in particular. 

If the support will be broken, with the daily close below, price should decline further towards 427.2% Fibs at $57, that also corresponds to the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel . But, if the support will hold, trend reversal could be the case, and price is likely to start moving higher, at least towards the 50% Fibs resistance at $128

As you can see, Litecoin is just mere dollars away from breaking below closest critical support; after that, it will be a free-fall to around $50 area, followed by another massive crash that will send it to sub $30 territory. 

Litecoin is a scam; the rise last year was manipulated and anyone who bought it above $100; rest assured, you will never ever make your money back. This is what you get for listening to scammers/ponzi scheme promoters. Litecoin has no real world use and might get delisted from Coinbase. 

Remember, the creator of Litecoin actually advised against buying it and sold all his coins at the top! 

During the last bear market, LTC performed worst of all coins and crashed 97% from its  ATH 0.25% . If the same scenario happens again, which so far looks like it does, this will send LTC to $9.70, which I believe is still way too much for this joke coin.

Today we're going to use Zone Analysis on the 15 Minute Chart.  As you can see, we've had two candles enter the Pink Zone.  History tells us we'll need to have at least one candle blast through the Brown Zone for a triple digit finish.  On the other hand, if we see the  SMI Ergodic Indicator  tighten up, the Brown Zone will be almost impossible to penetrate leaving us with a sideways or downward pattern.  We understand most people think Zone Analysis is unreliable, possibly even a little fishy, but we only use the original Formulas and Zones as intended by the original inventors.  Today we're calling for a definite move up, or down (or sideways).

LTC is approaching a key  support level  which intersects with the current downtrend line that it has been retesting as support since may. 

RSI  is completely bottomed out which does suggest the current price trend is running out of strength however in this market that is not a valid reason to go long. 

I will be keeping an eye out to see how LTC will react when the horizontal support meets the diagonal  trend line . My guess would be a sharp decline in price followed by a bounce and we should start to see some upwards price action. 

Ive also drawn some previous support / resistance levels at the sub $70 USD mark.

Today Litecoin has reached the  support level  at $72. This is the 361.8%  Fibonacci retracement  level that has been rejected cleanly. At the same time price has reached the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel , and overall it seems like it could reverse to the upside. 

Nevertheless, there are no confirmations of this happening right away and LTC/USD still could decline lower. It is important to watch the current price action in general and the $72 support in particular. 

If the support will be broken, with the daily close below, price should decline further towards 427.2% Fibs at $57, that also corresponds to the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel . But, if the support will hold, trend reversal could be the case, and price is likely to start moving higher, at least towards the 50% Fibs resistance at $128

Nevertheless, there are no confirmations of this happening right away and LTC/USD still could decline lower. It is important to watch the current price action in general and the $72 support in particular. 

If the support will be broken, with the daily close below, price should decline further towards 427.2% Fibs at $57, that also corresponds to the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel . But, if the support will hold, trend reversal could be the case, and price is likely to start moving higher, at least towards the 50% Fibs resistance at $128

As you can see, Litecoin is just mere dollars away from breaking below closest critical support; after that, it will be a free-fall to around $50 area, followed by another massive crash that will send it to sub $30 territory. 

Litecoin is a scam; the rise last year was manipulated and anyone who bought it above $100; rest assured, you will never ever make your money back. This is what you get for listening to scammers/ponzi scheme promoters. Litecoin has no real world use and might get delisted from Coinbase. 

Remember, the creator of Litecoin actually advised against buying it and sold all his coins at the top! 

During the last bear market, LTC performed worst of all coins and crashed 97% from its  ATH 0.25% . If the same scenario happens again, which so far looks like it does, this will send LTC to $9.70, which I believe is still way too much for this joke coin.

Today we're going to use Zone Analysis on the 15 Minute Chart.  As you can see, we've had two candles enter the Pink Zone.  History tells us we'll need to have at least one candle blast through the Brown Zone for a triple digit finish.  On the other hand, if we see the  SMI Ergodic Indicator  tighten up, the Brown Zone will be almost impossible to penetrate leaving us with a sideways or downward pattern.  We understand most people think Zone Analysis is unreliable, possibly even a little fishy, but we only use the original Formulas and Zones as intended by the original inventors.  Today we're calling for a definite move up, or down (or sideways).

LTC is approaching a key  support level  which intersects with the current downtrend line that it has been retesting as support since may. 

RSI  is completely bottomed out which does suggest the current price trend is running out of strength however in this market that is not a valid reason to go long. 

I will be keeping an eye out to see how LTC will react when the horizontal support meets the diagonal  trend line . My guess would be a sharp decline in price followed by a bounce and we should start to see some upwards price action. 

Ive also drawn some previous support / resistance levels at the sub $70 USD mark.

Today Litecoin has reached the  support level  at $72. This is the 361.8%  Fibonacci retracement  level that has been rejected cleanly. At the same time price has reached the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel , and overall it seems like it could reverse to the upside. 

Nevertheless, there are no confirmations of this happening right away and LTC/USD still could decline lower. It is important to watch the current price action in general and the $72 support in particular. 

If the support will be broken, with the daily close below, price should decline further towards 427.2% Fibs at $57, that also corresponds to the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel . But, if the support will hold, trend reversal could be the case, and price is likely to start moving higher, at least towards the 50% Fibs resistance at $128

As you can see, Litecoin is just mere dollars away from breaking below closest critical support; after that, it will be a free-fall to around $50 area, followed by another massive crash that will send it to sub $30 territory. 

Litecoin is a scam; the rise last year was manipulated and anyone who bought it above $100; rest assured, you will never ever make your money back. This is what you get for listening to scammers/ponzi scheme promoters. Litecoin has no real world use and might get delisted from Coinbase. 

Remember, the creator of Litecoin actually advised against buying it and sold all his coins at the top! 

During the last bear market, LTC performed worst of all coins and crashed 97% from its  ATH 0.25% . If the same scenario happens again, which so far looks like it does, this will send LTC to $9.70, which I believe is still way too much for this joke coin.

Today we're going to use Zone Analysis on the 15 Minute Chart.  As you can see, we've had two candles enter the Pink Zone.  History tells us we'll need to have at least one candle blast through the Brown Zone for a triple digit finish.  On the other hand, if we see the  SMI Ergodic Indicator  tighten up, the Brown Zone will be almost impossible to penetrate leaving us with a sideways or downward pattern.  We understand most people think Zone Analysis is unreliable, possibly even a little fishy, but we only use the original Formulas and Zones as intended by the original inventors.  Today we're calling for a definite move up, or down (or sideways).

Jun 25




Today we're going to use Zone Analysis on the 15 Minute Chart.  As you can see, we've had two candles enter the Pink Zone.  History tells us we'll need to have at least one candle blast through the Brown Zone for a triple digit finish.  On the other hand, if we see the  SMI Ergodic Indicator  tighten up, the Brown Zone will be almost impossible to penetrate leaving us with a sideways or downward pattern.  We understand most people think Zone Analysis is unreliable, possibly even a little fishy, but we only use the original Formulas and Zones as intended by the original inventors.  Today we're calling for a definite move up, or down (or sideways).

LTC is approaching a key  support level  which intersects with the current downtrend line that it has been retesting as support since may. 

RSI  is completely bottomed out which does suggest the current price trend is running out of strength however in this market that is not a valid reason to go long. 

I will be keeping an eye out to see how LTC will react when the horizontal support meets the diagonal  trend line . My guess would be a sharp decline in price followed by a bounce and we should start to see some upwards price action. 

Ive also drawn some previous support / resistance levels at the sub $70 USD mark.

Today Litecoin has reached the  support level  at $72. This is the 361.8%  Fibonacci retracement  level that has been rejected cleanly. At the same time price has reached the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel , and overall it seems like it could reverse to the upside. 

Nevertheless, there are no confirmations of this happening right away and LTC/USD still could decline lower. It is important to watch the current price action in general and the $72 support in particular. 

If the support will be broken, with the daily close below, price should decline further towards 427.2% Fibs at $57, that also corresponds to the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel . But, if the support will hold, trend reversal could be the case, and price is likely to start moving higher, at least towards the 50% Fibs resistance at $128

As you can see, Litecoin is just mere dollars away from breaking below closest critical support; after that, it will be a free-fall to around $50 area, followed by another massive crash that will send it to sub $30 territory. 

Litecoin is a scam; the rise last year was manipulated and anyone who bought it above $100; rest assured, you will never ever make your money back. This is what you get for listening to scammers/ponzi scheme promoters. Litecoin has no real world use and might get delisted from Coinbase. 

Remember, the creator of Litecoin actually advised against buying it and sold all his coins at the top! 

During the last bear market, LTC performed worst of all coins and crashed 97% from its  ATH             . If the same scenario happens again, which so far looks like it does, this will send LTC to $9.70, which I believe is still way too much for this joke coin.

As you can see, Litecoin is just mere dollars away from breaking below closest critical support; after that, it will be a free-fall to around $50 area, followed by another massive crash that will send it to sub $30 territory. 

Litecoin is a scam; the rise last year was manipulated and anyone who bought it above $100; rest assured, you will never ever make your money back. This is what you get for listening to scammers/ponzi scheme promoters. Litecoin has no real world use and might get delisted from Coinbase. 

Remember, the creator of Litecoin actually advised against buying it and sold all his coins at the top! 

During the last bear market, LTC performed worst of all coins and crashed 97% from its  ATH 0.25% . If the same scenario happens again, which so far looks like it does, this will send LTC to $9.70, which I believe is still way too much for this joke coin.

Jun 25




Today we're going to use Zone Analysis on the 15 Minute Chart.  As you can see, we've had two candles enter the Pink Zone.  History tells us we'll need to have at least one candle blast through the Brown Zone for a triple digit finish.  On the other hand, if we see the  SMI Ergodic Indicator  tighten up, the Brown Zone will be almost impossible to penetrate leaving us with a sideways or downward pattern.  We understand most people think Zone Analysis is unreliable, possibly even a little fishy, but we only use the original Formulas and Zones as intended by the original inventors.  Today we're calling for a definite move up, or down (or sideways).

LTC is approaching a key  support level  which intersects with the current downtrend line that it has been retesting as support since may. 

RSI  is completely bottomed out which does suggest the current price trend is running out of strength however in this market that is not a valid reason to go long. 

I will be keeping an eye out to see how LTC will react when the horizontal support meets the diagonal  trend line . My guess would be a sharp decline in price followed by a bounce and we should start to see some upwards price action.

Today Litecoin has reached the  support level  at $72. This is the 361.8%  Fibonacci retracement  level that has been rejected cleanly. At the same time price has reached the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel , and overall it seems like it could reverse to the upside. 

Nevertheless, there are no confirmations of this happening right away and LTC/USD still could decline lower. It is important to watch the current price action in general and the $72 support in particular. 

If the support will be broken, with the daily close below, price should decline further towards 427.2% Fibs at $57, that also corresponds to the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel . But, if the support will hold, trend reversal could be the case, and price is likely to start moving higher, at least towards the 50% Fibs resistance at $128

Today we stick to our forecast of the growth of the Litecoin rate to $ 87. There are no plans to open Litecoin deals today, since the growth of Litecoin is a correction to a downward trend, and we are working on a trend. In addition, in such a flat other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  LTCUSD 5.00%  rate will rise from $ 76 to $ 87. 
2. The  LTCUSD 5.00%  rate will decrease from $ 76 to $ 70.

As you can see, Litecoin is just mere dollars away from breaking below closest critical support; after that, it will be a free-fall to around $50 area, followed by another massive crash that will send it to sub $30 territory. 

Litecoin is a scam; the rise last year was manipulated and anyone who bought it above $100; rest assured, you will never ever make your money back. This is what you get for listening to scammers/ponzi scheme promoters. Litecoin has no real world use and might get delisted from Coinbase. 

Remember, the creator of Litecoin actually advised against buying it and sold all his coins at the top! 

During the last bear market, LTC performed worst of all coins and crashed 97% from its  ATH 0.25% . If the same scenario happens again, which so far looks like it does, this will send LTC to $9.70, which I believe is still way too much for this joke coin.

Today we're going to use Zone Analysis on the 15 Minute Chart.  As you can see, we've had two candles enter the Pink Zone.  History tells us we'll need to have at least one candle blast through the Brown Zone for a triple digit finish.  On the other hand, if we see the  SMI Ergodic Indicator  tighten up, the Brown Zone will be almost impossible to penetrate leaving us with a sideways or downward pattern.  We understand most people think Zone Analysis is unreliable, possibly even a little fishy, but we only use the original Formulas and Zones as intended by the original inventors.  Today we're calling for a definite move up, or down (or sideways).

LTC is approaching a key  support level  which intersects with the current downtrend line that it has been retesting as support since may. 

RSI  is completely bottomed out which does suggest the current price trend is running out of strength however in this market that is not a valid reason to go long. 

I will be keeping an eye out to see how LTC will react when the horizontal support meets the diagonal  trend line . My guess would be a sharp decline in price followed by a bounce and we should start to see some upwards price action. 

Ive also drawn some previous support / resistance levels at the sub $70 USD mark.

Today Litecoin has reached the  support level  at $72. This is the 361.8%  Fibonacci retracement  level that has been rejected cleanly. At the same time price has reached the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel , and overall it seems like it could reverse to the upside. 

Nevertheless, there are no confirmations of this happening right away and LTC/USD still could decline lower. It is important to watch the current price action in general and the $72 support in particular. 

If the support will be broken, with the daily close below, price should decline further towards 427.2% Fibs at $57, that also corresponds to the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel . But, if the support will hold, trend reversal could be the case, and price is likely to start moving higher, at least towards the 50% Fibs resistance at $128

Nevertheless, there are no confirmations of this happening right away and LTC/USD still could decline lower. It is important to watch the current price action in general and the $72 support in particular. 

If the support will be broken, with the daily close below, price should decline further towards 427.2% Fibs at $57, that also corresponds to the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel . But, if the support will hold, trend reversal could be the case, and price is likely to start moving higher, at least towards the 50% Fibs resistance at $128

Today we stick to our forecast of the growth of the Litecoin rate to $ 87. There are no plans to open Litecoin deals today, since the growth of Litecoin is a correction to a downward trend, and we are working on a trend. In addition, in such a flat other scenarios are possible.

As you can see, Litecoin is just mere dollars away from breaking below closest critical support; after that, it will be a free-fall to around $50 area, followed by another massive crash that will send it to sub $30 territory. 

Litecoin is a scam; the rise last year was manipulated and anyone who bought it above $100; rest assured, you will never ever make your money back. This is what you get for listening to scammers/ponzi scheme promoters. Litecoin has no real world use and might get delisted from Coinbase. 

Remember, the creator of Litecoin actually advised against buying it and sold all his coins at the top! 

During the last bear market, LTC performed worst of all coins and crashed 97% from its  ATH 0.25% . If the same scenario happens again, which so far looks like it does, this will send LTC to $9.70, which I believe is still way too much for this joke coin.

Today we're going to use Zone Analysis on the 15 Minute Chart.  As you can see, we've had two candles enter the Pink Zone.  History tells us we'll need to have at least one candle blast through the Brown Zone for a triple digit finish.  On the other hand, if we see the  SMI Ergodic Indicator  tighten up, the Brown Zone will be almost impossible to penetrate leaving us with a sideways or downward pattern.  We understand most people think Zone Analysis is unreliable, possibly even a little fishy, but we only use the original Formulas and Zones as intended by the original inventors.  Today we're calling for a definite move up, or down (or sideways).

LTC is approaching a key  support level  which intersects with the current downtrend line that it has been retesting as support since may. 

RSI  is completely bottomed out which does suggest the current price trend is running out of strength however in this market that is not a valid reason to go long. 

I will be keeping an eye out to see how LTC will react when the horizontal support meets the diagonal  trend line . My guess would be a sharp decline in price followed by a bounce and we should start to see some upwards price action. 

Ive also drawn some previous support / resistance levels at the sub $70 USD mark.

Today Litecoin has reached the  support level  at $72. This is the 361.8%  Fibonacci retracement  level that has been rejected cleanly. At the same time price has reached the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel , and overall it seems like it could reverse to the upside. 

Nevertheless, there are no confirmations of this happening right away and LTC/USD still could decline lower. It is important to watch the current price action in general and the $72 support in particular. 

If the support will be broken, with the daily close below, price should decline further towards 427.2% Fibs at $57, that also corresponds to the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel . But, if the support will hold, trend reversal could be the case, and price is likely to start moving higher, at least towards the 50% Fibs resistance at $128

As you can see, Litecoin is just mere dollars away from breaking below closest critical support; after that, it will be a free-fall to around $50 area, followed by another massive crash that will send it to sub $30 territory. 

Litecoin is a scam; the rise last year was manipulated and anyone who bought it above $100; rest assured, you will never ever make your money back. This is what you get for listening to scammers/ponzi scheme promoters. Litecoin has no real world use and might get delisted from Coinbase. 

Remember, the creator of Litecoin actually advised against buying it and sold all his coins at the top! 

During the last bear market, LTC performed worst of all coins and crashed 97% from its  ATH 0.25% . If the same scenario happens again, which so far looks like it does, this will send LTC to $9.70, which I believe is still way too much for this joke coin.

Today we're going to use Zone Analysis on the 15 Minute Chart.  As you can see, we've had two candles enter the Pink Zone.  History tells us we'll need to have at least one candle blast through the Brown Zone for a triple digit finish.  On the other hand, if we see the  SMI Ergodic Indicator  tighten up, the Brown Zone will be almost impossible to penetrate leaving us with a sideways or downward pattern.  We understand most people think Zone Analysis is unreliable, possibly even a little fishy, but we only use the original Formulas and Zones as intended by the original inventors.  Today we're calling for a definite move up, or down (or sideways).

Today we're going to use Zone Analysis on the 15 Minute Chart.  As you can see, we've had two candles enter the Pink Zone.  History tells us we'll need to have at least one candle blast through the Brown Zone for a triple digit finish.  On the other hand, if we see the  SMI Ergodic Indicator  tighten up, the Brown Zone will be almost impossible to penetrate leaving us with a sideways or downward pattern.  We understand most people think Zone Analysis is unreliable, possibly even a little fishy, but we only use the original Formulas and Zones as intended by the original inventors.  Today we're calling for a definite move up, or down (or sideways).

LTC is approaching a key  support level  which intersects with the current downtrend line that it has been retesting as support since may. 

RSI  is completely bottomed out which does suggest the current price trend is running out of strength however in this market that is not a valid reason to go long. 

I will be keeping an eye out to see how LTC will react when the horizontal support meets the diagonal  trend line . My guess would be a sharp decline in price followed by a bounce and we should start to see some upwards price action. 

Ive also drawn some previous support / resistance levels at the sub $70 USD mark.

Today Litecoin has reached the  support level  at $72. This is the 361.8%  Fibonacci retracement  level that has been rejected cleanly. At the same time price has reached the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel , and overall it seems like it could reverse to the upside. 

Nevertheless, there are no confirmations of this happening right away and LTC/USD still could decline lower. It is important to watch the current price action in general and the $72 support in particular. 

If the support will be broken, with the daily close below, price should decline further towards 427.2% Fibs at $57, that also corresponds to the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel . But, if the support will hold, trend reversal could be the case, and price is likely to start moving higher, at least towards the 50% Fibs resistance at $128

As you can see, Litecoin is just mere dollars away from breaking below closest critical support; after that, it will be a free-fall to around $50 area, followed by another massive crash that will send it to sub $30 territory. 

Litecoin is a scam; the rise last year was manipulated and anyone who bought it above $100; rest assured, you will never ever make your money back. This is what you get for listening to scammers/ponzi scheme promoters. Litecoin has no real world use and might get delisted from Coinbase. 

Remember, the creator of Litecoin actually advised against buying it and sold all his coins at the top! 

During the last bear market, LTC performed worst of all coins and crashed 97% from its  ATH 0.25% . If the same scenario happens again, which so far looks like it does, this will send LTC to $9.70, which I believe is still way too much for this joke coin.

As you can see, Litecoin is just mere dollars away from breaking below closest critical support; after that, it will be a free-fall to around $50 area, followed by another massive crash that will send it to sub $30 territory. 

Litecoin is a scam; the rise last year was manipulated and anyone who bought it above $100; rest assured, you will never ever make your money back. This is what you get for listening to scammers/ponzi scheme promoters. Litecoin has no real world use and might get delisted from Coinbase. 

Remember, the creator of Litecoin actually advised against buying it and sold all his coins at the top! 

During the last bear market, LTC performed worst of all coins and crashed 97% from its  ATH 0.25% . If the same scenario happens again, which so far looks like it does, this will send LTC to $9.70, which I believe is still way too much for this joke coin.

Jun 25




Today we're going to use Zone Analysis on the 15 Minute Chart.  As you can see, we've had two candles enter the Pink Zone.  History tells us we'll need to have at least one candle blast through the Brown Zone for a triple digit finish.  On the other hand, if we see the  SMI Ergodic Indicator  tighten up, the Brown Zone will be almost impossible to penetrate leaving us with a sideways or downward pattern.  We understand most people think Zone Analysis is unreliable, possibly even a little fishy, but we only use the original Formulas and Zones as intended by the original inventors.  Today we're calling for a definite move up, or down (or sideways).

LTC is approaching a key  support level  which intersects with the current downtrend line that it has been retesting as support since may. 

RSI  is completely bottomed out which does suggest the current price trend is running out of strength however in this market that is not a valid reason to go long. 

I will be keeping an eye out to see how LTC will react when the horizontal support meets the diagonal  trend line . My guess would be a sharp decline in price followed by a bounce and we should start to see some upwards price action.

Today Litecoin has reached the  support level  at $72. This is the 361.8%  Fibonacci retracement  level that has been rejected cleanly. At the same time price has reached the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel , and overall it seems like it could reverse to the upside. 

Nevertheless, there are no confirmations of this happening right away and LTC/USD still could decline lower. It is important to watch the current price action in general and the $72 support in particular. 

If the support will be broken, with the daily close below, price should decline further towards 427.2% Fibs at $57, that also corresponds to the lower  trendline  of the  descending channel . But, if the support will hold, trend reversal could be the case, and price is likely to start moving higher, at least towards the 50% Fibs resistance at $128
