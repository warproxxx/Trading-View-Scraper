Can't tell what is going to happen quite yet. Overall I would lean  bullish , but 1 more dip to 5900 in a  bullish  scenario on a longer time frame could still play out.

an hour ago




Hello friends! 

At the moment, on the timeframe DAILY, the figure ""head and shoulders"" is quite clear. 
The target point is at the level of 6000-6050 $. 

Let me remind you that ""H&S"" is a figure from the number of reversals and after working out this figure it is quite possible that we ( BTC -1.07% ) can go further Up. 


P.S. However, if we look at the next of our forecast, we can see the same figure, at H1-H4, but the ""Head"" will be at the top of the graphic, and the aim (target) will be in the bottom, about 6250-6300$.  Be attenive!
