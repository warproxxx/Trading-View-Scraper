1530768363.0,CryptoManiac101,Bitcoin In 2 Separate Pattern Cycles - CryptoManiac101,"




34 minutes ago




Here we are looking at 2 high potential patterns. First is a Semi-Symmentrical  Triangle Pattern  or Symmetrical Pattern and second is Downward  Wedge  Pattern. 

Both patterns are  bullish  in medium term with Downward  wedge  having greater chance for upward break which would be followed by bull run for few weeks. 

Both of these patterns usually breakout after 70% - 77% into pattern with downward  wedge  taking longer, coming in at 74% - 77% vs symmetrical triangle at 70% - 72% 

In other words we can say that out of 100 downward  wedge  patterns, an average number of 75 crypto coins or stocks broke out 75% into cycle. 

Probability of each track that  Bitcoin 0.20%  can take are outlined on chart, however keep in mind that they can be changed at any time period after each candle. Do not pay much attention to it, just keep in mind general directions  Bitcoin 0.20%  may or may not take. 

Indicators 

MACD  is  bullish , no questions to be asked there 

RSI  /  STOCH  both indicate that we have room for further downward trend, unfortunately not neutral at all with majority leaning toward  bearish . 

Personal Take 

We personally are  bullish  on  Bitcoin 0.20%  no matter what and just like everyone here, we want to see a break already because we do not need to hit any more supports, bottoms or whatever else some analysts on here will say. We have gone through filtration cycle where newer investors were mostly kicked out of cryptocurrency after panic sells. 

Nice thing about cryptocurrency is that it does not matter what indicators say... Most of the times they will do exact opposite. We saw that with ETC, with TRON, STRAT and many other high market cap and medium cap crypto. 

Should you buy in or wait? 

Medium term and long term investors can without question buy into  Bitcoin 0.20%  or alts. 

Short term investors should identify their risk ability and if one should decide that they want to minimize risk, then we would recommend to stay back. If you're willing to give it some risk, then enter with Stop Loss, but do not put into limit order. Do it manually just make sure you have access to exchange during majority of day time. If you are an investor who is willing to take a risk, then you should enter without Stop Loss. 

Is this a bubble? 

Yes, we actually got tons of messages asking us this exact question. Answer is a resounding NO. Not sure why you would even ask that question and compare it to dot com or  tulip              correction. They are incomparable at all. We are dealing with a different technology that is low on market cap still. 

Is whole market a bubble in long term? 

Yes, it is a bubble in long term and we all know that. Nevertheless we are talking 5+ years into future or over 200 trillion market cap. Right now it's too early to worry about that. 

Recommendation 

Choose  Bitcoin 0.20%  or few alts. Invest into them today and just walk away for at least 4-6 month. Do not keep trading them because you will end up FOMO -  ing -0.35%  and loosing your investment. 

Enjoy this trade advice my Crypto Maniacs, but remember to invest only what you can afford to lose or you're going right back to poverty on drop. We are not your financial advisors.

Comment:
					As you can see from chart below 5D chart looks much more bullish. STOCH, RSI both indicate high growth potential. What does that mean when we look at both charts? It means that longer term outlook is much more promising then short term. What should you do? Go into longer term investment vs short term

					Here's another look at longer term trade which shows that we bullishly broke through resistance on 5D chart indicating either a short term mini bull run followed by massive one or mini one followed by correction which would confirm symmetrical pattern

I see hidden bear division on D1, and, a  rising wedge . I understand some influencers have mentioned the  rising wedge ( bearish  signal) could be a fake out, and that we could break the 6900-7000 resistance. However, taking cue from my previous experiences charting  bitcoin             , we've two indicators (both bear  div              &  rising wedge ) pointing a similar outcome, i.e. a drop; Ideally, a short from >6750 would be  a good idea  imo             . As usual, appreciate your thoughts & comments.

Not to mention the similar patterns are visible on H4 and other TFs. On H4, we can see regular bear div, implying the journey from 66-6800 could be a tight squeeze, or a sudden pump/dump squeezing both longs and shorts, while respecting the diagonal support and resistances of the rising wedge before dropping to sub 6500 levels.

 Bitcoin 0.20%  went upwards yesterday, but retreated later within a correction. The currency pair has added more than two percent in the past 24 hours. The price moves along the ascending  trend line  meaning BTC/USD still looks upwards and is promising. 

Bitcoin 0.20%  has tested the  resistance area  at $6,718 on Wednesday as we had previously predicted, but the price declined towards the ascending  trend line  later. BTC/USD touched this  trend line  and seems to jump off it meaning bulls are ready to develop the uptrend in the nearest future. 
We have two  bullish  signals in a row in the moment of writing. The first comes from the  bullish Engulfing candlestick  pattern. The second formed when the ascending  trend line  rejected the price. As for targets, we think that BTC/USD is likely to retest the  resistance area  at $6,718 first and to move higher targeting the next resistance at $6,943. This target may be reached on Thursday-Friday. 
As for the alternative scenario, the currency pair will break through the ascending  trend line  and move lower. The first  bearish  goal lies at the  support area  at $6,510 and the second is even lower at $6,329.

The 50  SMA  is about to move up thhrough the 200  SMA  on the three hour chart timeframe. The last time this happened was April 15th area. Possibly this momentum will get a boost here and you may see a good candle to the upside. However, I'm not overly confident about this rally. If we can push through 7000 it might have some legs... we'll see...

Hey lovers, welcome to yet another daily  BTC              update.. but today he's being REALLY CHEEKY! Shall we begin? 

Its looks to me like the big boys who run this market pumped the market to go hit the previous high, run stops on people shorting AND give the general public the idea that we're going full  bullish . But I am not biting and neither should you. The  volume  spiked and went back down to ''normal'' which indicates clear market manipulation. There is no reason to think a 6months old  bearish  market is coming to an end right now.  BTC              is still set to drop lower (much lower). It will take a HUGE news or for the people in control to push it back up and they aren't giving us any sign that they're about to. We've seen MULTIPLE bulltraps on  btc              in the last few months and I have no reason to think this counter trend movement isn't one of them. I am still firmly holding my ground and calling another big drop very soon. 

Who's Becky? What's her background? I am a crypto enthusiast and have been since early 2015. I have already made millions in the crypto world and am financially set for the rest of my life. I recently decided to start helping other people get rich. I like helping people, it makes me feel good. What can I say? I LOVE feeling good ;) . Let's share the journey together!

1530762720.0,Godly,Going.. going.. going... [$BTC Daily analysis - 7/4],"
Little update for those following the  daily analysis  , since it was on the 4hr chart it is hard to update on the structure daily, but will follow the underlying trend for the 1hr. The  shark  is still in play however I have removed it from the chart to de-clutter it (See 7/3). The short-term structure is still  bullish  but it is near a possible LH for larger structure which would be the sweet spot for shorting. The high right above our current is our last chance for the bears to keep the structure going, if not; the bulls have fully taken over and you can move from sell the rally to buy the dip for the mid-term.  
There is also hidden  bearish  divergence on 4hr and  bearish  divergence on the 4hr aswell as the 1hr.

If this continues to play out this way there is a good probability this  wedge  could drop the price back down to the  support zone  of the 4hr 50ma(in orange). Whether or not the 50ma will maintain support if it breaks own tot hat level is the question. Of course we could always break upward too but I won't be confident of that until the 4hr  rsi  and stochrsi are low enough with the price action close enough to the 4hr 200ma(in blue) and the top  trendline  of the symmetrical triangle we are in (in pink) to be able to have enough momentum to surpass them both and trigger a breakout. As of now both those indicators could stand to be a little lower before the next upswing. If the upswing happens before they drop, it's very unlikely we will break out of the pink triangle.

					Bearish divergence on 4hr rsi increases the probability of a breakdown as well:
