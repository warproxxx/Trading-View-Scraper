Bulls are holding 4 hour support but also have a short term  double top  of resistance to watch. 
Clear range of  support and resistance  short term to be watching.  
Daily consolidation at this point is very healthy and bears would need a clear leg down to gain short term control fully.  
We have seen a couple pumps at 9:15 AM Eastern (less than 2 hours). Not enough to call it a pattern, but something to keep an eye out for.  
Bulls taking back control of the hourly chart with a clear break of resistance would keep the potential of daily bull continuation as a possibility.  
Daily chart  forming inside bars to watch for a break as well.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD -0.02%  accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

Bitcoin investors, beware! RBI ban on cryptocurrencies kicks-in, and you have only 2 options 
The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. This means that cryptocurrency investors have only two options – do not transact or transact in cash. “The choking of banking channels means that virtually all cryptocurrency related transactions will have to be done in cash or not at all,” Rashmi Deshpande, Associate Partner at Khaitan & Co said. 
However, this is only a virtual ban, say cryptocurrency stakeholders, adding that there is a possibility that the government may come up with a policy to regulate cryptocurrencies in future. “I would like to say that Indian market just needs to be patient for the government to formulate a strategy which safeguards the interest of all investors in the country,” Sandeep Phogat,  CEO -5.82% , Panaesha Capital said. 
Israel  Bitcoin -0.02%  Exchange Agrees to Share Customer Info with Tax Authority 
Bits of  Gold -0.29% , a major Israeli cryptocurrency exchange, has entered an agreement to share customers’ transaction details with the country’s tax authority. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold -0.29%  will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold -0.29%  – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold -0.29%  is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin -0.02%  and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin -0.02%  miners are levied fixed business tax rates.

an hour ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 0.03%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP 0.00%  members they've suckered in.

Right now we can see the biggest bull divergence yet, so exciting times ahead to be fair.  

Note: The top of april can also been seen as a  bearish  divergence, forgot to include that one.

-  BTC 0.15%  is possibly forming a inverted head&shoulders pattern. If  BTC 0.15%  can complete it I expect a mid-long term  bullish  sentiment again. Originally it would mean a trend reversal! - 

This could happen 
I think we might see a drop to the $6000-6400 area. If we see some  bullish  candles afterwards and we manage to break the 'neckline', I'll be completely  bullish  on  BTC 0.15% . The neckline resistance is around $6750.  

Ofcourse it's impossible to predict  BTC 0.15%  or any other coin. This is a possible scenario and it seems to me the most logical outcome. I'll be trading on this. Layering between the $6000-6400 area. I came out at $6725 expecting a correction.

an hour ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 0.15%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP              members they've suckered in.

Bulls are holding 4 hour support but also have a short term  double top  of resistance to watch. 
Clear range of  support and resistance  short term to be watching.  
Daily consolidation at this point is very healthy and bears would need a clear leg down to gain short term control fully.  
We have seen a couple pumps at 9:15 AM Eastern (less than 2 hours). Not enough to call it a pattern, but something to keep an eye out for.  
Bulls taking back control of the hourly chart with a clear break of resistance would keep the potential of daily bull continuation as a possibility.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD 0.15%  accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

Bitcoin investors, beware! RBI ban on cryptocurrencies kicks-in, and you have only 2 options 
The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. This means that cryptocurrency investors have only two options – do not transact or transact in cash. “The choking of banking channels means that virtually all cryptocurrency related transactions will have to be done in cash or not at all,” Rashmi Deshpande, Associate Partner at Khaitan & Co said. 
However, this is only a virtual ban, say cryptocurrency stakeholders, adding that there is a possibility that the government may come up with a policy to regulate cryptocurrencies in future. “I would like to say that Indian market just needs to be patient for the government to formulate a strategy which safeguards the interest of all investors in the country,” Sandeep Phogat,  CEO -5.82% , Panaesha Capital said. 
Israel  Bitcoin 0.15%  Exchange Agrees to Share Customer Info with Tax Authority 
Bits of  Gold -0.30% , a major Israeli cryptocurrency exchange, has entered an agreement to share customers’ transaction details with the country’s tax authority. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold -0.30%  will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold -0.30%  – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold -0.30%  is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin 0.15%  and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin 0.15%  miners are levied fixed business tax rates.

Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP 0.00%  members they've suckered in.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD 0.07%  accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0.

Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today.

Israel  Bitcoin 0.07%  Exchange Agrees to Share Customer Info with Tax Authority 
Bits of  Gold -0.31% , a major Israeli cryptocurrency exchange, has entered an agreement to share customers’ transaction details with the country’s tax authority. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold -0.31%  will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold -0.31%  – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold -0.31%  is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin 0.07%  and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin 0.07%  miners are levied fixed business tax rates.

an hour ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 0.07%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP 0.00%  members they've suckered in.

Bits of  Gold -0.30% , a major Israeli cryptocurrency exchange, has entered an agreement to share customers’ transaction details with the country’s tax authority. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold -0.30%  will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold -0.30%  – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold -0.30%  is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin 0.09%  and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin 0.09%  miners are levied fixed business tax rates. While individual investors are required to co

an hour ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 0.09%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP              members they've suckered in.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD 0.09%  accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

Ofcourse it's impossible to predict  BTC 0.82%  or any other coin. This is a possible scenario and it seems to me the most logical outcome. I'll be trading on this. Layering between the $6000-6400 area. I came out at $6725 expecting a correction.

an hour ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin              patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP              members they've suckered in.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD 1.34%  accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. This means that cryptocurrency investors have only two options – do not transact or transact in cash. “The choking of banking channels means that virtually all cryptocurrency related transactions will have to be done in cash or not at all,” Rashmi Deshpande, Associate Partner at Khaitan & Co said. 
However, this is only a virtual ban, say cryptocurrency stakeholders, adding that there is a possibility that the government may come up with a policy to regulate cryptocurrencies in future. “I would like to say that Indian market just needs to be patient for the government to formulate a strategy which safeguards the interest of all investors in the country,” Sandeep Phogat,  CEO -5.82% , Panaesha Capital said. 
Israel  Bitcoin 1.34%  Exchange Agrees to Share Customer Info with Tax Authority 
Bits of  Gold             , a major Israeli cryptocurrency exchange, has entered an agreement to share customers’ transaction details with the country’s tax authority. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold              will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold              – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold              is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin 1.34%  and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin 1.34%  miners are levied fixed business tax rates.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD 1.16%  accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. This means that cryptocurrency investors have only two options – do not transact or transact in cash. “The choking of banking channels means that virtually all cryptocurrency related transactions will have to be done in cash or not at all,” Rashmi Deshpande, Associate Partner at Khaitan & Co said. 
However, this is only a virtual ban, say cryptocurrency stakeholders, adding that there is a possibility that the government may come up with a policy to regulate cryptocurrencies in future. “I would like to say that Indian market just needs to be patient for the government to formulate a strategy which safeguards the interest of all investors in the country,” Sandeep Phogat,  CEO -5.82% , Panaesha Capital said. 
Israel  Bitcoin 1.16%  Exchange Agrees to Share Customer Info with Tax Authority 
Bits of  Gold -0.32% , a major Israeli cryptocurrency exchange, has entered an agreement to share customers’ transaction details with the country’s tax authority. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold -0.32%  will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold -0.32%  – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold -0.32%  is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin 1.16%  and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin 1.16%  miners are levied fixed business tax rates.

Ofcourse it's impossible to predict  BTC 1.13%  or any other coin. This is a possible scenario and it seems to me the most logical outcome. I'll be trading on this. Layering between the $6000-6400 area. I came out at $6725 expecting a correction.

an hour ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 1.13%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP 0.00%  members they've suckered in.

an hour ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 1.05%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP 0.00%  members they've suckered in.

Clear range of  support and resistance  short term to be watching.  
Daily consolidation at this point is very healthy and bears would need a clear leg down to gain short term control fully.  
We have seen a couple pumps at 9:15 AM Eastern (less than 2 hours). Not enough to call it a pattern, but something to keep an eye out for.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD 1.05%  accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. This means that cryptocurrency investors have only two options – do not transact or transact in cash. “The choking of banking channels means that virtually all cryptocurrency related transactions will have to be done in cash or not at all,” Rashmi Deshpande, Associate Partner at Khaitan & Co said. 
However, this is only a virtual ban, say cryptocurrency stakeholders, adding that there is a possibility that the government may come up with a policy to regulate cryptocurrencies in future. “I would like to say that Indian market just needs to be patient for the government to formulate a strategy which safeguards the interest of all investors in the country,” Sandeep Phogat,  CEO             , Panaesha Capital said. 
Israel  Bitcoin 1.05%  Exchange Agrees to Share Customer Info with Tax Authority 
Bits of  Gold -0.29% , a major Israeli cryptocurrency exchange, has entered an agreement to share customers’ transaction details with the country’s tax authority. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold -0.29%  will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold -0.29%  – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold -0.29%  is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin 1.05%  and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin 1.05%  miners are levied fixed business tax rates.

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP              members they've suckered in.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD 0.99%  accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. This means that cryptocurrency investors have only two options – do not transact or transact in cash. “The choking of banking channels means that virtually all cryptocurrency related transactions will have to be done in cash or not at all,” Rashmi Deshpande, Associate Partner at Khaitan & Co said. 
However, this is only a virtual ban, say cryptocurrency stakeholders, adding that there is a possibility that the government may come up with a policy to regulate cryptocurrencies in future. “I would like to say that Indian market just needs to be patient for the government to formulate a strategy which safeguards the interest of all investors in the country,” Sandeep Phogat,  CEO -5.82% , Panaesha Capital said. 
Israel  Bitcoin 0.99%  Exchange Agrees to Share Customer Info with Tax Authority 
Bits of  Gold -0.27% , a major Israeli cryptocurrency exchange, has entered an agreement to share customers’ transaction details with the country’s tax authority. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold -0.27%  will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold -0.27%  – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold -0.27%  is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin 0.99%  and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin 0.99%  miners are levied fixed business tax rates.

an hour ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 0.99%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP              members they've suckered in.

Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold -0.26%  will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold -0.26%  – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold -0.26%  is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin 1.07%  and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin 1.07%  miners are levied fixed business tax rates. While individual investors are required to co

an hour ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 1.01%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP              members they've suckered in.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD 1.00%  accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

Ofcourse it's impossible to predict  BTC 0.99%  or any other coin. This is a possible scenario and it seems to me the most logical outcome. I'll be trading on this. Layering between the $6000-6400 area. I came out at $6725 expecting a correction.

an hour ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 1.00%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP 0.00%  members they've suckered in.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD 0.93%  accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. This means that cryptocurrency investors have only two options – do not transact or transact in cash. “The choking of banking channels means that virtually all cryptocurrency related transactions will have to be done in cash or not at all,” Rashmi Deshpande, Associate Partner at Khaitan & Co said. 
However, this is only a virtual ban, say cryptocurrency stakeholders, adding that there is a possibility that the government may come up with a policy to regulate cryptocurrencies in future. “I would like to say that Indian market just needs to be patient for the government to formulate a strategy which safeguards the interest of all investors in the country,” Sandeep Phogat,  CEO             , Panaesha Capital said. 
Israel  Bitcoin 0.93%  Exchange Agrees to Share Customer Info with Tax Authority 
Bits of  Gold -0.25% , a major Israeli cryptocurrency exchange, has entered an agreement to share customers’ transaction details with the country’s tax authority. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold -0.25%  will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold -0.25%  – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold -0.25%  is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin 0.93%  and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin 0.93%  miners are levied fixed business tax rates.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD 0.90%  accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. This means that cryptocurrency investors have only two options – do not transact or transact in cash. “The choking of banking channels means that virtually all cryptocurrency related transactions will have to be done in cash or not at all,” Rashmi Deshpande, Associate Partner at Khaitan & Co said.

Israel  Bitcoin 0.90%  Exchange Agrees to Share Customer Info with Tax Authority 
Bits of  Gold -0.24% , a major Israeli cryptocurrency exchange, has entered an agreement to share customers’ transaction details with the country’s tax authority. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold -0.24%  will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold -0.24%  – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold -0.24%  is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin 0.90%  and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin 0.90%  miners are levied fixed business tax rates.

2 hours ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 0.84%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP 0.00%  members they've suckered in.

2 hours ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 0.76%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP 0.00%  members they've suckered in.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD 0.77%  accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. This means that cryptocurrency investors have only two options – do not transact or transact in cash. “The choking of banking channels means that virtually all cryptocurrency related transactions will have to be done in cash or not at all,” Rashmi Deshpande, Associate Partner at Khaitan & Co said. 
However, this is only a virtual ban, say cryptocurrency stakeholders, adding that there is a possibility that the government may come up with a policy to regulate cryptocurrencies in future. “I would like to say that Indian market just needs to be patient for the government to formulate a strategy which safeguards the interest of all investors in the country,” Sandeep Phogat,  CEO -5.82% , Panaesha Capital said. 
Israel  Bitcoin 0.77%  Exchange Agrees to Share Customer Info with Tax Authority 
Bits of  Gold             , a major Israeli cryptocurrency exchange, has entered an agreement to share customers’ transaction details with the country’s tax authority. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold              will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold              – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold              is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin 0.77%  and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin 0.77%  miners are levied fixed business tax rates.

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP              members they've suckered in.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD 0.72%  accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. This means that cryptocurrency investors have only two options – do not transact or transact in cash. “The choking of banking channels means that virtually all cryptocurrency related transactions will have to be done in cash or not at all,” Rashmi Deshpande, Associate Partner at Khaitan & Co said. 
However, this is only a virtual ban, say cryptocurrency stakeholders, adding that there is a possibility that the government may come up with a policy to regulate cryptocurrencies in future. “I would like to say that Indian market just needs to be patient for the government to formulate a strategy which safeguards the interest of all investors in the country,” Sandeep Phogat,  CEO -5.82% , Panaesha Capital said. 
Israel  Bitcoin 0.72%  Exchange Agrees to Share Customer Info with Tax Authority 
Bits of  Gold -0.24% , a major Israeli cryptocurrency exchange, has entered an agreement to share customers’ transaction details with the country’s tax authority. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold -0.24%  will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold -0.24%  – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold -0.24%  is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin 0.72%  and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin 0.72%  miners are levied fixed business tax rates.

2 hours ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 0.71%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP              members they've suckered in.

Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold -0.24%  will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold -0.24%  – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold -0.24%  is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin 0.76%  and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin 0.76%  miners are levied fixed business tax rates. While individual investors are required to co

2 hours ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 0.76%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP 0.00%  members they've suckered in.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD 0.77%  accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

Ofcourse it's impossible to predict  BTC 0.74%  or any other coin. This is a possible scenario and it seems to me the most logical outcome. I'll be trading on this. Layering between the $6000-6400 area. I came out at $6725 expecting a correction.

2 hours ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 0.74%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP              members they've suckered in.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD              accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

Bitcoin investors, beware! RBI ban on cryptocurrencies kicks-in, and you have only 2 options 
The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. This means that cryptocurrency investors have only two options – do not transact or transact in cash. “The choking of banking channels means that virtually all cryptocurrency related transactions will have to be done in cash or not at all,” Rashmi Deshpande, Associate Partner at Khaitan & Co said. 
However, this is only a virtual ban, say cryptocurrency stakeholders, adding that there is a possibility that the government may come up with a policy to regulate cryptocurrencies in future. “I would like to say that Indian market just needs to be patient for the government to formulate a strategy which safeguards the interest of all investors in the country,” Sandeep Phogat,  CEO             , Panaesha Capital said. 
Israel  Bitcoin              Exchange Agrees to Share Customer Info with Tax Authority 
Bits of  Gold             , a major Israeli cryptocurrency exchange, has entered an agreement to share customers’ transaction details with the country’s tax authority. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold              will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold              – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold              is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin              and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin              miners are levied fixed business tax rates.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD 0.70%  accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. This means that cryptocurrency investors have only two options – do not transact or transact in cash. “The choking of banking channels means that virtually all cryptocurrency related transactions will have to be done in cash or not at all,” Rashmi Deshpande, Associate Partner at Khaitan & Co said. 
However, this is only a virtual ban, say cryptocurrency stakeholders, adding that there is a possibility that the government may come up with a policy to regulate cryptocurrencies in future. “I would like to say that Indian market just needs to be patient for the government to formulate a strategy which safeguards the interest of all investors in the country,” Sandeep Phogat,  CEO -5.82% , Panaesha Capital said. 
Israel  Bitcoin 0.70%  Exchange Agrees to Share Customer Info with Tax Authority 
Bits of  Gold -0.21% , a major Israeli cryptocurrency exchange, has entered an agreement to share customers’ transaction details with the country’s tax authority. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold -0.21%  will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold -0.21%  – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold -0.21%  is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin 0.70%  and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin 0.70%  miners are levied fixed business tax rates.

Ofcourse it's impossible to predict  BTC 0.70%  or any other coin. This is a possible scenario and it seems to me the most logical outcome. I'll be trading on this. Layering between the $6000-6400 area. I came out at $6725 expecting a correction.

2 hours ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 0.70%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP 0.00%  members they've suckered in.

2 hours ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 0.70%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP              members they've suckered in.

Bulls are holding 4 hour support but also have a short term  double top  of resistance to watch. 
Clear range of  support and resistance  short term to be watching.  
Daily consolidation at this point is very healthy and bears would need a clear leg down to gain short term control fully.  
We have seen a couple pumps at 9:15 AM Eastern (less than 2 hours). Not enough to call it a pattern, but something to keep an eye out for.  
Bulls taking back control of the hourly chart with a clear break of resistance would keep the potential of daily bull continuation as a possibility.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD 0.70%  accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

Bitcoin investors, beware! RBI ban on cryptocurrencies kicks-in, and you have only 2 options 
The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. This means that cryptocurrency investors have only two options – do not transact or transact in cash. “The choking of banking channels means that virtually all cryptocurrency related transactions will have to be done in cash or not at all,” Rashmi Deshpande, Associate Partner at Khaitan & Co said. 
However, this is only a virtual ban, say cryptocurrency stakeholders, adding that there is a possibility that the government may come up with a policy to regulate cryptocurrencies in future. “I would like to say that Indian market just needs to be patient for the government to formulate a strategy which safeguards the interest of all investors in the country,” Sandeep Phogat,  CEO -5.82% , Panaesha Capital said. 
Israel  Bitcoin 0.70%  Exchange Agrees to Share Customer Info with Tax Authority 
Bits of  Gold -0.25% , a major Israeli cryptocurrency exchange, has entered an agreement to share customers’ transaction details with the country’s tax authority. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold -0.25%  will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold -0.25%  – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold -0.25%  is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin 0.70%  and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin 0.70%  miners are levied fixed business tax rates.

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP 0.00%  members they've suckered in.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD 0.70%  accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. This means that cryptocurrency investors have only two options – do not transact or transact in cash. “The choking of banking channels means that virtually all cryptocurrency related transactions will have to be done in cash or not at all,” Rashmi Deshpande, Associate Partner at Khaitan & Co said. 
However, this is only a virtual ban, say cryptocurrency stakeholders, adding that there is a possibility that the government may come up with a policy to regulate cryptocurrencies in future. “I would like to say that Indian market just needs to be patient for the government to formulate a strategy which safeguards the interest of all investors in the country,” Sandeep Phogat,  CEO -5.82% , Panaesha Capital said. 
Israel  Bitcoin 0.70%  Exchange Agrees to Share Customer Info with Tax Authority 
Bits of  Gold -0.24% , a major Israeli cryptocurrency exchange, has entered an agreement to share customers’ transaction details with the country’s tax authority. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold -0.24%  will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold -0.24%  – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold -0.24%  is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin 0.70%  and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin 0.70%  miners are levied fixed business tax rates.

2 hours ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 0.70%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP 0.00%  members they've suckered in.

Bits of  Gold -0.24% , a major Israeli cryptocurrency exchange, has entered an agreement to share customers’ transaction details with the country’s tax authority. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold -0.24%  will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold -0.24%  – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold -0.24%  is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin 0.72%  and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin 0.72%  miners are levied fixed business tax rates. While individual investors are required to co

2 hours ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 0.74%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP 0.00%  members they've suckered in.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD 0.74%  accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

2 hours ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 0.74%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP 0.00%  members they've suckered in.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD              accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

Bitcoin investors, beware! RBI ban on cryptocurrencies kicks-in, and you have only 2 options 
The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. This means that cryptocurrency investors have only two options – do not transact or transact in cash. “The choking of banking channels means that virtually all cryptocurrency related transactions will have to be done in cash or not at all,” Rashmi Deshpande, Associate Partner at Khaitan & Co said. 
However, this is only a virtual ban, say cryptocurrency stakeholders, adding that there is a possibility that the government may come up with a policy to regulate cryptocurrencies in future. “I would like to say that Indian market just needs to be patient for the government to formulate a strategy which safeguards the interest of all investors in the country,” Sandeep Phogat,  CEO             , Panaesha Capital said. 
Israel  Bitcoin              Exchange Agrees to Share Customer Info with Tax Authority 
Bits of  Gold             , a major Israeli cryptocurrency exchange, has entered an agreement to share customers’ transaction details with the country’s tax authority. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold              will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold              – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold              is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin              and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin              miners are levied fixed business tax rates.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD 0.73%  accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. This means that cryptocurrency investors have only two options – do not transact or transact in cash. “The choking of banking channels means that virtually all cryptocurrency related transactions will have to be done in cash or not at all,” Rashmi Deshpande, Associate Partner at Khaitan & Co said. 
However, this is only a virtual ban, say cryptocurrency stakeholders, adding that there is a possibility that the government may come up with a policy to regulate cryptocurrencies in future. “I would like to say that Indian market just needs to be patient for the government to formulate a strategy which safeguards the interest of all investors in the country,” Sandeep Phogat,  CEO -5.82% , Panaesha Capital said. 
Israel  Bitcoin 0.73%  Exchange Agrees to Share Customer Info with Tax Authority 
Bits of  Gold -0.21% , a major Israeli cryptocurrency exchange, has entered an agreement to share customers’ transaction details with the country’s tax authority. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold -0.21%  will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold -0.21%  – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold -0.21%  is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin 0.73%  and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin 0.73%  miners are levied fixed business tax rates.

Ofcourse it's impossible to predict  BTC 0.73%  or any other coin. This is a possible scenario and it seems to me the most logical outcome. I'll be trading on this. Layering between the $6000-6400 area. I came out at $6725 expecting a correction.

2 hours ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 0.73%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP 0.00%  members they've suckered in.

2 hours ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 0.73%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP              members they've suckered in.

Daily consolidation at this point is very healthy and bears would need a clear leg down to gain short term control fully.  
We have seen a couple pumps at 9:15 AM Eastern (less than 2 hours). Not enough to call it a pattern, but something to keep an eye out for.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD 0.73%  accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. This means that cryptocurrency investors have only two options – do not transact or transact in cash. “The choking of banking channels means that virtually all cryptocurrency related transactions will have to be done in cash or not at all,” Rashmi Deshpande, Associate Partner at Khaitan & Co said. 
However, this is only a virtual ban, say cryptocurrency stakeholders, adding that there is a possibility that the government may come up with a policy to regulate cryptocurrencies in future. “I would like to say that Indian market just needs to be patient for the government to formulate a strategy which safeguards the interest of all investors in the country,” Sandeep Phogat,  CEO             , Panaesha Capital said. 
Israel  Bitcoin 0.73%  Exchange Agrees to Share Customer Info with Tax Authority 
Bits of  Gold -0.19% , a major Israeli cryptocurrency exchange, has entered an agreement to share customers’ transaction details with the country’s tax authority. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold -0.19%  will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold -0.19%  – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold -0.19%  is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin 0.73%  and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin 0.73%  miners are levied fixed business tax rates.

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP 0.00%  members they've suckered in.

Price 
6700.0 resistance appears too strong for the price, for now,  BTCUSD 0.64%  accompanied by lowering demand has declined to the 6400.0 support during the past day. Volumes distribution concentrates around the 6500.0 level or higher, which supports the possibility of further  bullish  moves, as we see that this price seems suitable for big buy-ins. To confirm an upward impulse, we will need to see a hike above the 6700.0 resistance. From the below – 6400.0 level supports  bullish  scenario, breakthrough below the 6400 level could bring the price back to 6000.0. Also note, that the longer price will stay in the lateral corridor (6400 – 6700) the more probability of decline to 6000.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6400.0 – 6700.0 zone. A breakthrough above the 6700.0 – upward signal. A breakthrough below 6400.0 – downward signal.

The RBI ban by asking banks and other registered entities to terminate their business relationships with firms and individuals dealing in cryptocurrency kicked-in from today. This means that cryptocurrency investors have only two options – do not transact or transact in cash. “The choking of banking channels means that virtually all cryptocurrency related transactions will have to be done in cash or not at all,” Rashmi Deshpande, Associate Partner at Khaitan & Co said. 
However, this is only a virtual ban, say cryptocurrency stakeholders, adding that there is a possibility that the government may come up with a policy to regulate cryptocurrencies in future. “I would like to say that Indian market just needs to be patient for the government to formulate a strategy which safeguards the interest of all investors in the country,” Sandeep Phogat,  CEO -5.82% , Panaesha Capital said. 
Israel  Bitcoin 0.64%  Exchange Agrees to Share Customer Info with Tax Authority 
Bits of  Gold -0.21% , a major Israeli cryptocurrency exchange, has entered an agreement to share customers’ transaction details with the country’s tax authority. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold -0.21%  will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold -0.21%  – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold -0.21%  is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin 0.64%  and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin 0.64%  miners are levied fixed business tax rates.

2 hours ago




Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 0.64%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP 0.00%  members they've suckered in.

Under the terms of the agreement, Israeli cryptocurrency exchange Bits of  Gold              will provide information of clients who have made transactions exceeding $50,000 over the last 12 months to the Israel Tax Authority, local publication Calcalist reports citing sources familiar with the agreement. 
While Israeli law dictates that financial brokerages are required to pass on information of large and suspicious transactions to the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA), they aren’t necessarily obligated to do the same with the tax authority due to privacy concerns. For precedent, an Israeli court rejected a request by the tax authority to receive a client list from a bankrupt bank since those details are protected under privacy laws. 
It is therefore particularly notable that this agreement has come to light wherein Bits of  Gold              – an exchange with over 50,000 registered users – has agreed to pass on client information to the tax authority. The latter is said to be seeking the data to check for money laundering and tax evasion. 
The report also revealed that the tax authority audited the company’s books last month, ‘targeting not the company itself but its large-scale clients’. Bits of  Gold              is merely the first cryptocurrency exchange approached by the tax authority ‘in such a manner’, the report added, suggesting the agency will also be scrutinizing other domestic exchanges. 
As reported by CCN, the Israel Tax Authority first issued tax guidelines for cryptocurrency in early 2017.  Bitcoin 0.53%  and other cryptocurrencies have been deemed as assets wherein retail investors and even  bitcoin 0.53%  miners are levied fixed business tax rates. While individual investors are required to co

OBV on the weekly chart is a great tool for finding reversal signs. So far all the divergences the past few months has played out pretty nicely.  
Right now we can see the biggest bull divergence yet, so exciting times ahead to be fair.  

Note: The top of april can also been seen as a  bearish  divergence, forgot to include that one.

Inevitably a $700 one day drop occurred. 

In the days leading up to TODAY  Stoch RSI  is maxed out and  RSI  undersold.  
A $700 one day drop is therefore a very real possibility today or tomorrow. 

I fully expect the $5555 critical support to hold if we come close to it.  
This is all just part of the long term consolidation ahead of the rise back up to $20,000 later this year.

-  BTC 0.52%  is possibly forming a inverted head&shoulders pattern. If  BTC 0.52%  can complete it I expect a mid-long term  bullish  sentiment again. Originally it would mean a trend reversal! - 

This could happen 
I think we might see a drop to the $6000-6400 area. If we see some  bullish  candles afterwards and we manage to break the 'neckline', I'll be completely  bullish  on  BTC 0.52% . The neckline resistance is around $6750.  

Ofcourse it's impossible to predict  BTC 0.52%  or any other coin. This is a possible scenario and it seems to me the most logical outcome. I'll be trading on this. Layering between the $6000-6400 area. I came out at $6725 expecting a correction.

Just wanted to throw down a quick scenario;  

There's a few things that have been bothering me throughout this recent uptrend. Firstly  volume , it's been very far between with large pumps followed by a total drop off, more concerning to me is that these pumps happened at the same time of day twice, my rule of thumb for  Bitcoin 0.52%  patterns is that twice is a coincidence, three times and everyone notices, the fourth time never happens.  

Secondly I don't like the number of harmonics failing over the last few days, of course you cannot expect even most  harmonic patterns  to break as expected but they are often a good indicator of buyer and seller behaviour so I dislike the number that have turned around with quick spikes of  volume  which then disappears again.  

Where we are right now we should drop if you took things at face value, this strikes me as too obvious and when combined with these injections of  volume  it makes me wonder why we aren't seeing the same selling pressure rather than a slow bleed out. Then we have the  head & shoulders  idea, I don't like relying on these patterns as once again it's just too obvious to spot, in my mind  head & shoulders  patterns are more of a natural formation in retail driven markets, which of course this is in theory, but there's nothing at all about this entire upwards move that shouts retail buyer. Retail buyers do not buy all at once at the same time on consecutive days then stop all together.  

This leads me to the possible play that I am leaning towards right now - We will invalidate the  H&S  by making a higher right shoulder, we will then create another flag before rising again to meet our  trendline . Only then do I think we will see some serious selling  volume  enter just as buyers believe we are about to break upwards, this can be followed by a retest of support around the $6,150 area... after this point I am not even going to guess what will follow from there, and anyone claiming they are not employing a degree of guess work is most likely full of sh*t.  

This is of course entirely conjecture without confirmation and could be invalidated in the next few hours, but there's something rather odd about the last 24 hours price movement and this is making me lean towards the above scenario having a good chance of playing out.  

Hope this has helped give some ideas if nothing else, as always do your own thing and never trade purely based on what you've read on here regardless of how many  VIP              members they've suckered in.

We are moving inside a  downtrend channel . The last reversal was with good  volume  and the current pullback is healthy. During July I expect some more upside. 

Trade at your own risk. 
Trade wisely.
