1531075108.0,hea79,XRP Short Term Entry possibility & Midweek Pump ,"
Looks like we will have some little ups and downs before around midweek then a nice pump as we make it towards the end of this bigger symmetrical triangle. 

Thinking  BTC              may make some big movements up to the 7.3ish area but then think we will retest 6.8ish after that...   

Anyways there is some cash to be made in the alts this week when  BTC              spikes so good luck guys!
