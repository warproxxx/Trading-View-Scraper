1530491335.0,RB-30,2 July 2018 -> Will BTC continue his uptrend? - 1 hour chart,"
On the  daily chart  we saw a  bullish engulfing  pattern with a confirmation, also the downtrend is broken. But it doesn't mean that there is going to be an uptrend.  

At the moment we can zoom in at the 1 hour chart. So over here we see a continuation pattern, the  bullish flag , which is not completed yet. So we can't say anything about the trend yet. But we can setup a trading plan, when this pattern will be completed.  

My trading plan would look as follows: 
- Entry: I plan to go long after a  candlestick  closes above the upper blue trend 
- Stop loss: Support line at 6290 
- Target: See the dark blue areas 

ALWAYS keep in mind! That this is NOT an investment advice, but an analyse . You can do whatever you want with this information, so trade at your own risks!

1530491224.0,SignalToSignal,Volume Trend Analysis on Bitcoin (BTCUSD Hourly) Weakness,"
Weakness has came in on the  Volume  Trend Advsior (Available on Trading View)  BTCUSD -0.13%  0.09% Hourly Chart. Entry is 6349 and short term target (stall point is 6289 with 6312 being an intermediate stall point) The last target from strength was hit and I linked to that one from here.  

There tends to be a bit of  choppiness  on the weekends but I saw the indication flip and wanted to post it out to those that follow us.  

The  Volume  Trend Advisor (The red and green indications on the chart) indicates in real-time and cannot repaint as it uses closed price and  volume  analysis to determine likely changes in direction/trend. The Green icon = Strength and the Red icon = Weakness. If you have any questions regarding this fairly simple and accurate method of  volume  analysis, please contact us directly via PM here or via our website.

I refined the same two (2) graphs and imposed parallel ranges on key levels with arrows indicating rhythmic breakout patterns.

1530487922.0,simulacra1990,BTC forming another Bart Simpson??? Ay Caramba!,"
Bart Simpson TA is real.  

No longer just a meme. Bulls, beware the Bart Simpson pattern. The spiky haired little rascal has slain many a bull.  

First, he will pump you up with a big green candle. This is the start of his trickery. All seems well as his classic spiky hairdo remains steady, leaving you waiting for the next breakout from the squeeze.  

Alas, this is all part of Bart Simpsons nefarious plan: He has a giant red candle hiding in his back pocket, along with that infamous slingshot.  

Bart Simpson is beyond TA. Bart Simpson is life. Don't get rekt. 

This if not financial advice; do your own research; I'm a plebian idiot; etc etc
