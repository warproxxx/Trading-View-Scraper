1530310875.0,Zohaib,Bitcoin next big supernova is coming soon.,"
We are expecting a big supernova coming into  Bitcoin 6.99%  if we touch this giant stack of unfilled buy orders currently sitting at 4420 to 2800 area. This time we are limited to 15,000 because fresh supply is there.

44 minutes ago




Hi guys, 

Welcome back, i did took a break from posting. Felt very tired with University and work, brain was smoggy, now im back with fresh brain. 

I will be more cautious since low  volume  can make very unexpected move. I still hodl from my last buy. Didnt feel the greed to bet on a low  volume  market but learned plently of things that is more valuable than the current % loss, knowledge. 

Scenario A) Lower low at 5k 








Scenario B) ABCDE triangle. testing upper resistance.  MACD double bottom  (almost triple bottom). 








Extra information that i found interesting : 

Look how the weekly and monthly  stoch RSI  are oversold : 
Weekly 








Monthly  







----- 
i may be more active in july. the new month will bring valuable data.

1530310376.0,CryptoTrendsIO,BTC bottoms at $5760. Gradual recovery ahead.,"
HI. It's my opinion that  BTC 6.98%  hit bottom at $5760 a short while ago. The bears have lost their steam with little left to sell. There could be one more large spike downward followed by a sudden recovery to kick off a moderate bull market. There could also be a sudden upthrust causing a painful short squeeeeeze. Ouch! Nevertheless, the overall general energy in the market is weak but seems to be heading on a  bullish , baby bull more likely, trend. Good luck everyone!

We can see on the 4hr chart  bullish divergence  has formed on both the  RSI  and  MACD  chart. The Low  volatility  in my opinion suggests that the bears are out of breath and that the market will turnover into a new Bull cycle soon.  
Cheers.
