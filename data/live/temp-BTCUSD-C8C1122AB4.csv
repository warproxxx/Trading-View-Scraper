Everyone should buy  BTC 0.13%  with the intentions of waiting until the end of Q4 to see any type of return. There is nothing truely heart warming about the crypto-verse right now. For all the good news that occured in the past few months nothing seems to spark new investors  to buy. The fact that the mantra for crypto currency is HODL'ing isn't helping the space either. Imagine if people starting hodl'ing USD's instead of spending it, that wouldn't be good for the economy, right?

1530227631.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Bearish Momentum But Support Zone Still In Play.,"
 BTCUSD 0.13%  update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin 0.14%  is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr 0.52%  chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

Technical Analysis: The  Zig Zag Indicator 
The  Zig Zag indicator  is what is known as a filtering or smoothing indicator. Its primary purpose is to filter out insignificant fluctuations in the price of a security and accurately track whatever the existing trend is. It can also be used to identify  support and resistance  price levels in a market. 

It’s also sometimes used by technical analysts who adopt the  Elliott Wave  Principle of analysis to help identify the beginning and end of each wave in a cycle. 



The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

Comment:
					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

I feel something 'unclear' in my count(especially from 15th of May), but I think it is most possible in current situation 

If you saw my previous post, you can absolutely understand ""why catching the bottom is not that much important in current spot"" -  cuz 1.26%  anyway we can get into right position in 90% of correction. 

However I want to share this one to whom want to be the real bottom catcher  xD

Its primary purpose is to filter out insignificant fluctuations in the price of a security and accurately track whatever the existing trend is. It can also be used to identify  support and resistance  price levels in a market.

The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

Everyone should buy  BTC 0.70%  with the intentions of waiting until the end of Q4 to see any type of return. There is nothing truely heart warming about the crypto-verse right now. For all the good news that occured in the past few months nothing seems to spark new investors  to buy. The fact that the mantra for crypto currency is HODL'ing isn't helping the space either.

1530227631.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Bearish Momentum But Support Zone Still In Play.,"
 BTCUSD 0.67%  update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin 0.67%  is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr 0.52%  chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

 BTCUSD 0.46%  update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin 0.46%  is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr 0.52%  chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

Technical Analysis: The  Zig Zag Indicator 
The  Zig Zag indicator  is what is known as a filtering or smoothing indicator. Its primary purpose is to filter out insignificant fluctuations in the price of a security and accurately track whatever the existing trend is. It can also be used to identify  support and resistance  price levels in a market. 

It’s also sometimes used by technical analysts who adopt the  Elliott Wave  Principle of analysis to help identify the beginning and end of each wave in a cycle. 



The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

Comment:
					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

Technical Analysis: The  Zig Zag Indicator

Its primary purpose is to filter out insignificant fluctuations in the price of a security and accurately track whatever the existing trend is. It can also be used to identify  support and resistance  price levels in a market. 

It’s also sometimes used by technical analysts who adopt the  Elliott Wave  Principle of analysis to help identify the beginning and end of each wave in a cycle. 



The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

For all the good news that occured in the past few months nothing seems to spark new investors  to buy. The fact that the mantra for crypto currency is HODL'ing isn't helping the space either.

1530227631.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Bearish Momentum But Support Zone Still In Play.,"
 BTCUSD              update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin              is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr              chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

1530227631.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Bearish Momentum But Support Zone Still In Play.,"
 BTCUSD              update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin 0.52%  is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr 0.52%  chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

Technical Analysis: The  Zig Zag Indicator 
The  Zig Zag indicator  is what is known as a filtering or smoothing indicator. Its primary purpose is to filter out insignificant fluctuations in the price of a security and accurately track whatever the existing trend is. It can also be used to identify  support and resistance  price levels in a market. 

It’s also sometimes used by technical analysts who adopt the  Elliott Wave  Principle of analysis to help identify the beginning and end of each wave in a cycle. 



The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

Comment:
					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

If you saw my previous post, you can absolutely understand ""why catching the bottom is not that much important in current spot"" -  cuz              anyway we can get into right position in 90% of correction. 

However I want to share this one to whom want to be the real bottom catcher  xD

Technical Analysis: The  Zig Zag Indicator

Its primary purpose is to filter out insignificant fluctuations in the price of a security and accurately track whatever the existing trend is. It can also be used to identify  support and resistance  price levels in a market. 

It’s also sometimes used by technical analysts who adopt the  Elliott Wave  Principle of analysis to help identify the beginning and end of each wave in a cycle. 



The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

Everyone should buy  BTC 0.51%  with the intentions of waiting until the end of Q4 to see any type of return. There is nothing truely heart warming about the crypto-verse right now. For all the good news that occured in the past few months nothing seems to spark new investors  to buy. The fact that the mantra for crypto currency is HODL'ing isn't helping the space either.

1530227631.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Bearish Momentum But Support Zone Still In Play.,"
 BTCUSD 0.51%  update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin 0.51%  is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr 0.52%  chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

1530227631.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Bearish Momentum But Support Zone Still In Play.,"
 BTCUSD              update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin              is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr              chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

Technical Analysis: The  Zig Zag Indicator 
The  Zig Zag indicator  is what is known as a filtering or smoothing indicator. Its primary purpose is to filter out insignificant fluctuations in the price of a security and accurately track whatever the existing trend is. It can also be used to identify  support and resistance  price levels in a market. 

It’s also sometimes used by technical analysts who adopt the  Elliott Wave  Principle of analysis to help identify the beginning and end of each wave in a cycle. 



The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

Comment:
					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

If you saw my previous post, you can absolutely understand ""why catching the bottom is not that much important in current spot"" -  cuz              anyway we can get into right position in 90% of correction.

The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

Everyone should buy  BTC 0.89%  with the intentions of waiting until the end of Q4 to see any type of return. There is nothing truely heart warming about the crypto-verse right now. For all the good news that occured in the past few months nothing seems to spark new investors  to buy. The fact that the mantra for crypto currency is HODL'ing isn't helping the space either. Imagine if people starting hodl'ing USD's instead of spending it, that wouldn't be good for the economy, right?

1530227631.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Bearish Momentum But Support Zone Still In Play.,"
 BTCUSD 0.89%  update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin 0.89%  is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr 0.52%  chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

 BTCUSD 0.81%  update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin 0.81%  is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr 0.52%  chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

Technical Analysis: The  Zig Zag Indicator 
The  Zig Zag indicator  is what is known as a filtering or smoothing indicator. Its primary purpose is to filter out insignificant fluctuations in the price of a security and accurately track whatever the existing trend is. It can also be used to identify  support and resistance  price levels in a market. 

It’s also sometimes used by technical analysts who adopt the  Elliott Wave  Principle of analysis to help identify the beginning and end of each wave in a cycle. 



The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

Comment:
					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

If you saw my previous post, you can absolutely understand ""why catching the bottom is not that much important in current spot"" -  cuz 1.26%  anyway we can get into right position in 90% of correction. 

However I want to share this one to whom want to be the real bottom catcher  xD

Its primary purpose is to filter out insignificant fluctuations in the price of a security and accurately track whatever the existing trend is. It can also be used to identify  support and resistance  price levels in a market.

The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

Everyone should buy  BTC 0.65%  with the intentions of waiting until the end of Q4 to see any type of return. There is nothing truely heart warming about the crypto-verse right now. For all the good news that occured in the past few months nothing seems to spark new investors  to buy. The fact that the mantra for crypto currency is HODL'ing isn't helping the space either.

1530227631.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Bearish Momentum But Support Zone Still In Play.,"
 BTCUSD 0.65%  update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin 0.65%  is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr 0.52%  chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

 BTCUSD 0.63%  update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin 0.63%  is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr 0.52%  chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

Technical Analysis: The  Zig Zag Indicator 
The  Zig Zag indicator  is what is known as a filtering or smoothing indicator. Its primary purpose is to filter out insignificant fluctuations in the price of a security and accurately track whatever the existing trend is. It can also be used to identify  support and resistance  price levels in a market. 

It’s also sometimes used by technical analysts who adopt the  Elliott Wave  Principle of analysis to help identify the beginning and end of each wave in a cycle. 



The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

Comment:
					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

If you saw my previous post, you can absolutely understand ""why catching the bottom is not that much important in current spot"" -  cuz 1.26%  anyway we can get into right position in 90% of correction. 

However I want to share this one to whom want to be the real bottom catcher  xD

The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

Everyone should buy  BTC 0.84%  with the intentions of waiting until the end of Q4 to see any type of return. There is nothing truely heart warming about the crypto-verse right now. For all the good news that occured in the past few months nothing seems to spark new investors  to buy. The fact that the mantra for crypto currency is HODL'ing isn't helping the space either.

1530227631.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Bearish Momentum But Support Zone Still In Play.,"
 BTCUSD              update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin 0.84%  is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr 0.52%  chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

1530227631.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Bearish Momentum But Support Zone Still In Play.,"
 BTCUSD              update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin 0.65%  is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr 0.52%  chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

Technical Analysis: The  Zig Zag Indicator 
The  Zig Zag indicator  is what is known as a filtering or smoothing indicator. Its primary purpose is to filter out insignificant fluctuations in the price of a security and accurately track whatever the existing trend is. It can also be used to identify  support and resistance  price levels in a market. 

It’s also sometimes used by technical analysts who adopt the  Elliott Wave  Principle of analysis to help identify the beginning and end of each wave in a cycle. 



The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

Comment:
					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

If you saw my previous post, you can absolutely understand ""why catching the bottom is not that much important in current spot"" -  cuz              anyway we can get into right position in 90% of correction.

The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

Everyone should buy  BTC 0.41%  with the intentions of waiting until the end of Q4 to see any type of return. There is nothing truely heart warming about the crypto-verse right now. For all the good news that occured in the past few months nothing seems to spark new investors  to buy. The fact that the mantra for crypto currency is HODL'ing isn't helping the space either.

1530227631.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Bearish Momentum But Support Zone Still In Play.,"
 BTCUSD 0.46%  update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin 0.46%  is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr 0.52%  chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

1530227631.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Bearish Momentum But Support Zone Still In Play.,"
 BTCUSD              update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin 0.40%  is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr 0.52%  chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

Technical Analysis: The  Zig Zag Indicator 
The  Zig Zag indicator  is what is known as a filtering or smoothing indicator. Its primary purpose is to filter out insignificant fluctuations in the price of a security and accurately track whatever the existing trend is. It can also be used to identify  support and resistance  price levels in a market. 

It’s also sometimes used by technical analysts who adopt the  Elliott Wave  Principle of analysis to help identify the beginning and end of each wave in a cycle. 



The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

Comment:
					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

If you saw my previous post, you can absolutely understand ""why catching the bottom is not that much important in current spot"" -  cuz 1.26%  anyway we can get into right position in 90% of correction. 

However I want to share this one to whom want to be the real bottom catcher  xD

Technical Analysis: The  Zig Zag Indicator

Its primary purpose is to filter out insignificant fluctuations in the price of a security and accurately track whatever the existing trend is. It can also be used to identify  support and resistance  price levels in a market. 

It’s also sometimes used by technical analysts who adopt the  Elliott Wave  Principle of analysis to help identify the beginning and end of each wave in a cycle. 



The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

Everyone should buy  BTC 0.43%  with the intentions of waiting until the end of Q4 to see any type of return. There is nothing truely heart warming about the crypto-verse right now. For all the good news that occured in the past few months nothing seems to spark new investors  to buy. The fact that the mantra for crypto currency is HODL'ing isn't helping the space either.

1530227631.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Bearish Momentum But Support Zone Still In Play.,"
 BTCUSD 0.43%  update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin 0.43%  is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr 0.52%  chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

1530227631.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Bearish Momentum But Support Zone Still In Play.,"
 BTCUSD 0.44%  update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin 0.44%  is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr 0.52%  chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

Technical Analysis: The  Zig Zag Indicator 
The  Zig Zag indicator  is what is known as a filtering or smoothing indicator. Its primary purpose is to filter out insignificant fluctuations in the price of a security and accurately track whatever the existing trend is. It can also be used to identify  support and resistance  price levels in a market. 

It’s also sometimes used by technical analysts who adopt the  Elliott Wave  Principle of analysis to help identify the beginning and end of each wave in a cycle. 



The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

Comment:
					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

If you saw my previous post, you can absolutely understand ""why catching the bottom is not that much important in current spot"" -  cuz 1.26%  anyway we can get into right position in 90% of correction.

The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

Everyone should buy  BTC 0.55%  with the intentions of waiting until the end of Q4 to see any type of return. There is nothing truely heart warming about the crypto-verse right now. For all the good news that occured in the past few months nothing seems to spark new investors  to buy. The fact that the mantra for crypto currency is HODL'ing isn't helping the space either.

1530227631.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Bearish Momentum But Support Zone Still In Play.,"
 BTCUSD 0.55%  update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin 0.55%  is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr 0.52%  chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

1530227631.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Bearish Momentum But Support Zone Still In Play.,"
 BTCUSD 0.50%  update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin 0.50%  is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr 0.52%  chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

Technical Analysis: The  Zig Zag Indicator 
The  Zig Zag indicator  is what is known as a filtering or smoothing indicator. Its primary purpose is to filter out insignificant fluctuations in the price of a security and accurately track whatever the existing trend is. It can also be used to identify  support and resistance  price levels in a market. 

It’s also sometimes used by technical analysts who adopt the  Elliott Wave  Principle of analysis to help identify the beginning and end of each wave in a cycle. 



The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

Comment:
					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

If you saw my previous post, you can absolutely understand ""why catching the bottom is not that much important in current spot"" -  cuz 1.26%  anyway we can get into right position in 90% of correction. 

However I want to share this one to whom want to be the real bottom catcher  xD

Its primary purpose is to filter out insignificant fluctuations in the price of a security and accurately track whatever the existing trend is. It can also be used to identify  support and resistance  price levels in a market. 

It’s also sometimes used by technical analysts who adopt the  Elliott Wave  Principle of analysis to help identify the beginning and end of each wave in a cycle. 



The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

Everyone should buy  BTC 0.49%  with the intentions of waiting until the end of Q4 to see any type of return. There is nothing truely heart warming about the crypto-verse right now. For all the good news that occured in the past few months nothing seems to spark new investors  to buy. The fact that the mantra for crypto currency is HODL'ing isn't helping the space either.

1530227631.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Bearish Momentum But Support Zone Still In Play.,"
 BTCUSD 0.49%  update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin 0.49%  is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr 0.52%  chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

1530227631.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Bearish Momentum But Support Zone Still In Play.,"
 BTCUSD 0.44%  update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin 0.41%  is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr 0.52%  chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

Technical Analysis: The  Zig Zag Indicator 
The  Zig Zag indicator  is what is known as a filtering or smoothing indicator. Its primary purpose is to filter out insignificant fluctuations in the price of a security and accurately track whatever the existing trend is. It can also be used to identify  support and resistance  price levels in a market. 

It’s also sometimes used by technical analysts who adopt the  Elliott Wave  Principle of analysis to help identify the beginning and end of each wave in a cycle. 



The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

Comment:
					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

Everyone should buy  BTC 0.42%  with the intentions of waiting until the end of Q4 to see any type of return. There is nothing truely heart warming about the crypto-verse right now. For all the good news that occured in the past few months nothing seems to spark new investors  to buy. The fact that the mantra for crypto currency is HODL'ing isn't helping the space either. Imagine if people starting hodl'ing USD's instead of spending it, that wouldn't be good for the economy, right?

1530227631.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Bearish Momentum But Support Zone Still In Play.,"
 BTCUSD 0.42%  update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

1530227496.0,floatingturd,Another log down...,"
Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin 0.42%  is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr 0.52%  chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

Everyone should buy  BTC 0.47%  with the intentions of waiting until the end of Q4 to see any type of return. There is nothing truely heart warming about the crypto-verse right now. For all the good news that occured in the past few months nothing seems to spark new investors  to buy. The fact that the mantra for crypto currency is HODL'ing isn't helping the space either. Imagine if people starting hodl'ing USD's instead of spending it, that wouldn't be good for the economy, right?

1530227631.0,MarcPMarkets,BTCUSD: Bearish Momentum But Support Zone Still In Play.,"
 BTCUSD 0.47%  update: Price has taken out the previous  spinning top  low which is a  bearish  sign. Even though this is the case, the 6K and 5956 reversal zone supports are still in play. If this move fails to make a new low, this market will still be in position for a sharp squeeze. 

5755 is the low that needs to be taken out in order to prove  bearish  momentum is still in full effect. Like I wrote previously, bottoming is a process, and it is far from precise. 

At S.C., our swing trade was stopped out at 5980. Stops are not pleasant, but they protect accounts from being wiped out by hope mode. That is when you stay in the trade, hoping it comes back.  

Our inventory strategy does not change in a situation like this and the stop order was only for that specific swing trade. We are watching for a reversal formation to get long again because our strategy takes into account the probabilities of the broader location, and does not place any weight on noise. 

As long as price stays above 5755, it will likely be setting up for a squeeze. If price reaches 5669 and reverses quickly, that will also count for a failed low formation which will prompt us to look for a  bullish  reversal trigger as well. 

The  bearish  scenario for us is a break and close below the 5669 reversal zone boundary. In that scenario, we will stop looking to buy and just wait for stability to return. 

In summary,  bearish  momentum can present tough price action when it is right in the middle of a major  support area . At S.C., we consider this random price action until the market provides proof by taking out a major level. These are the kind of areas where patience from experience comes into play. Our  bullish  outlook has not changed, because nothing says that this market is going to make a new low at this point. 

The most we can do now is wait for structure to line up for the next swing trade long.

1530227496.0,floatingturd,Another log down...,"
Some people would call this another leg down, but they are wrong. This is another log down from the smelly bear that haunts us. Bitcoin's hands slipped right off the 28 shit rope. If you weren't paying attention, that brown steaming stool landed right on your stupid face, but you had a hard time seeing anyways because the last few loaves the bear pinched off landed and stuck to your eyes. All the while, you were lying to yourself saying we would have a bull run any second. Once again, I'm happy to have stayed out of this mess. 


So what's next in the pooping bum prophecy?  Well, we still have my projection of 5025ish from May, but  bitcoin 0.47%  is trying to do what I would call an early bounce. However, the  volume  is already stagnating again at a time where people are normally flocking in. Also look at the  RSI  on this 4  hr 0.52%  chart. We still have lots of room to go down. Also consider how far we had to go down for the last two bounces; about 14 and 18. 

The way the market has been behaving, I expect more sideways action inside this piss triangle as well as the 28 day shit rope inside the triangle. It's either that or we just keep going down to at least 5700 or even lower. On the upside I just don't see us going higher than 6100 in the next two days, but as usual my alerts are set for any drastic changes in the charts. And as ever, take my analysis with a bitter grain of piss.

Technical Analysis: The  Zig Zag Indicator 
The  Zig Zag indicator  is what is known as a filtering or smoothing indicator. Its primary purpose is to filter out insignificant fluctuations in the price of a security and accurately track whatever the existing trend is. It can also be used to identify  support and resistance  price levels in a market. 

It’s also sometimes used by technical analysts who adopt the  Elliott Wave  Principle of analysis to help identify the beginning and end of each wave in a cycle. 



The  Zig Zag  Indicator’s Primary Purpose – Riding a Trend 
By filtering out “noise” – insignificant price movements that occur within a sustained, long-term trend – the  Zig Zag indicator  is designed to help traders maintain a profitable market position throughout a sustained trend. 

The  Zig Zag indicator  draws its own  trendlines  that are created or adjusted only when there is a price movement greater than a designated percentage amount. The default value on most versions of the indicator is 5%, meaning that the  Zig Zag indicator  will not register any fluctuation in price that is less than 5%. Traders and market analysts can, of course, set their own minimum percentage values for the indicator. Values between 6% and 10% are commonly used variations from the default 5% value. 

By not reacting to all the minor, insignificant price moves that occur in day to day trading of a security, the  Zig Zag indicator  ideally helps traders to avoid being fooled by temporary price moves into abandoning profitable positions and to stay focused on the overall trend that is in place.

After 4 or so 4hr candles closed above the previous top  trendline  of the  falling wedge  with no  volume  to go with it, it became apparent that the  falling wedge  may be wider than originally anticipated...I have since switched the  trendlines  from the bodies to the wicks which has now create a much longer  falling wedge  as well, and we can see we are still very much inside the  wedge ...It also looks like the apex of the  wedge  now dips all the way down into the 5400 range. On top of this we also have  the potential of a  bear flag  on the 1 day chart breaking down...if it does so the projected drop target of that flag is around $5300.  Rsi  on the 4hr is nearing oversold however we have had the  rsi  in the oversold zone for extended periods of time recently so it would ot be a big surprise if that were to happen again.

Comment:
					We are currently breaking under the 1day charts bear flag with an hour and a half left before the candle closes. A close below is not yet confirmation of a breakdown until we get 1 additional follow up confirmation candle closing below as well, or a big boost in bear volume...however it is a very good sign that the bearish downtrend will continue. Only thing making it seem like a fakeout is possible is how close to oversold both the 1 day and 4hr rsi already are...which by itself the rsi being oversold may not be enough to stop the breakdown.

					Maybe even back two fractals to the 7500 mark.. wherever the 10/30/50 day moving averages are might be a good  lookout point... and i will know this is in play if we get another leg down ending the day near the bottom of the candle.  The 3/4 hr time frames may have oscillator divergence at that point too. Shorts cover and boom... you got a lambo candle flash rally.

My favorite count for current situation. 
I feel something 'unclear' in my count(especially from 15th of May), but I think it is most possible in current situation 

If you saw my previous post, you can absolutely understand ""why catching the bottom is not that much important in current spot"" -  cuz              anyway we can get into right position in 90% of correction. 

However I want to share this one to whom want to be the real bottom catcher  xD             

Let`s zoom in 











		Personally I will put some long order at $5,800~$5,700 - where  Shark  and  BAT pattern  can match at that area
