A well defined bearchannel is haunting this market. The  RSI  indicator has jumped out of oversold territory again which could be a hint that a countermove may be seen but what bulls really need is to break the string of lower highs and lows. 

The top end of the bearchannel is seen at 92 while 87 sees the  Bollinger Bands  midline. This area stands for the first resistance band. Above that a stonger ceiling between 103/110, previous support, is the next stop. One can say that a move above 110 is needed for technicals to improve in this crypto. 

It seems likely to see a test toward these levels short-term. 72 and 67 serve as support on dips.
