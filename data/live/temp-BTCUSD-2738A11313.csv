 Bullish  Scenario : 
BTC 0.00%  retraces till $6300 - $6250 (Yellow Box) range and then start wave 5 till $6600 - 6670 range ( Green Box) 

Bearish  Scenario : 
BTC 0.00%  retraces till $6300 - $6250 (Yellow Box) range and then retraces further till $6170 - $6100 (Red Box) 

In past 1 month  100 day MA has acted a solid resistance on 4HR time frame.   
For being  bullish  it needs to make 100 day MA as support.

1530394146.0,garyreza,Are we going to see a reversal soon?? - Part 3 (continuation),"
The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD 1.31% seq 1.77%  which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th -3.22%  candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC 0.00%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk.

On the 12h chart we can see that  
Bullish  signs:  
1)  Stochastic  was making higher lows for a while (last 4 lows numbered on the chart), while pricing was going down = Divergence.  
2) We also see lower highs on DMI/ADX chart = Divergence.  
Bearish  signs:  
1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.  
2) Vol is low and we see a decrease in Vol as price is increasing  

Personally I believe on 12h chart the  bearish  sings are stronger than  bullish  ones

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC 0.00%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC 0.00% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!

After the influx of  bullish volume  that flowed into  BTC 0.00%  ~28  hrs -0.15%  ago the price has begun to cool off and a  falling wedge  is forming on the charts.  

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

1530394513.0,euromotives,BTCUSD Fibonacci Support Resistance Zones: Bitcoin as of Jun 30,"
Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

My bias is to the upside, simple because we are due for a relief rally before we resume our descent to the 5000 mark. To put it simply, the market does not wait around and give you the oppurtunity to sell the top, nor buy the low. This does not qualify as a trend reversal to me, simple on the premise of the weakness of the rally. I would expect people to gobble  bitcoin 0.00%  up if this was indeed a reversal, maybe even a 2k candle. This is clearly not the case. Enjoy the relief rally!

Bullish  signs:  
1)  Stochastic  was making higher lows for a while (last 4 lows numbered on the chart), while pricing was going down = Divergence.  
2) We also see lower highs on DMI/ADX chart = Divergence.  
Bearish  signs:  
1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.  
2) Vol is low and we see a decrease in Vol as price is increasing  

Personally I believe on 12h chart the  bearish  sings are stronger than  bullish  ones

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC 0.27%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC 0.27% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!

After the influx of  bullish volume  that flowed into  BTC 0.31%  ~28  hrs -0.15%  ago the price has begun to cool off and a  falling wedge  is forming on the charts.  

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

My bias is to the upside, simple because we are due for a relief rally before we resume our descent to the 5000 mark. To put it simply, the market does not wait around and give you the oppurtunity to sell the top, nor buy the low. This does not qualify as a trend reversal to me, simple on the premise of the weakness of the rally. I would expect people to gobble  bitcoin 0.32%  up if this was indeed a reversal, maybe even a 2k candle. This is clearly not the case. Enjoy the relief rally!

1530394146.0,garyreza,Are we going to see a reversal soon?? - Part 3 (continuation),"
The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD 1.31% seq 1.77%  which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th -3.22%  candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC 0.17%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk.

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.

1530394146.0,garyreza,Are we going to see a reversal soon?? - Part 3 (continuation),"
The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD 1.31% seq 1.77%  which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th -3.22%  candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC 0.27%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk.

On the 12h chart we can see that  
Bullish  signs:  
1)  Stochastic  was making higher lows for a while (last 4 lows numbered on the chart), while pricing was going down = Divergence.  
2) We also see lower highs on DMI/ADX chart = Divergence.  
Bearish  signs:  
1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.  
2) Vol is low and we see a decrease in Vol as price is increasing

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC 0.28%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC 0.28% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!

After the influx of  bullish volume  that flowed into  BTC 0.28%  ~28  hrs -0.15%  ago the price has begun to cool off and a  falling wedge  is forming on the charts.  

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD 1.31% seq 1.77%  which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th -3.22%  candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC 0.32%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk.

On the 12h chart we can see that  
Bullish  signs:  
1)  Stochastic  was making higher lows for a while (last 4 lows numbered on the chart), while pricing was going down = Divergence.  
2) We also see lower highs on DMI/ADX chart = Divergence.  
Bearish  signs:  
1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC 0.33%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC 0.33% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!

After the influx of  bullish volume  that flowed into  BTC 0.33%  ~28  hrs -0.15%  ago the price has begun to cool off and a  falling wedge  is forming on the charts.  

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

My bias is to the upside, simple because we are due for a relief rally before we resume our descent to the 5000 mark. To put it simply, the market does not wait around and give you the oppurtunity to sell the top, nor buy the low. This does not qualify as a trend reversal to me, simple on the premise of the weakness of the rally. I would expect people to gobble  bitcoin 0.39%  up if this was indeed a reversal, maybe even a 2k candle. This is clearly not the case. Enjoy the relief rally!

The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern.

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory.

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC 0.68% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!

After the influx of  bullish volume  that flowed into  BTC 0.68%  ~28  hrs -0.15%  ago the price has begun to cool off and a  falling wedge  is forming on the charts.  

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  , Tenkan  San Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

My bias is to the upside, simple because we are due for a relief rally before we resume our descent to the 5000 mark. To put it simply, the market does not wait around and give you the oppurtunity to sell the top, nor buy the low. This does not qualify as a trend reversal to me, simple on the premise of the weakness of the rally. I would expect people to gobble  bitcoin 0.53%  up if this was indeed a reversal, maybe even a 2k candle. This is clearly not the case. Enjoy the relief rally!

1530394146.0,garyreza,Are we going to see a reversal soon?? - Part 3 (continuation),"
The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD 1.31% seq 1.77%  which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th -3.22%  candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC 0.66%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk. 

Remember that ""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""

On the 12h chart we can see that

1)  Stochastic  was making higher lows for a while (last 4 lows numbered on the chart), while pricing was going down = Divergence.  
2) We also see lower highs on DMI/ADX chart = Divergence.  
Bearish  signs:  
1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.  
2) Vol is low and we see a decrease in Vol as price is increasing

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC 0.66%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).

To put it simply, the market does not wait around and give you the oppurtunity to sell the top, nor buy the low. This does not qualify as a trend reversal to me, simple on the premise of the weakness of the rally. I would expect people to gobble  bitcoin 0.44%  up if this was indeed a reversal, maybe even a 2k candle. This is clearly not the case. Enjoy the relief rally!

1530394146.0,garyreza,Are we going to see a reversal soon?? - Part 3 (continuation),"
The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD 1.31% seq 1.77%  which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th -3.22%  candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC 0.46%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk.

On the 12h chart we can see that  
Bullish  signs:  
1)  Stochastic  was making higher lows for a while (last 4 lows numbered on the chart), while pricing was going down = Divergence.  
2) We also see lower highs on DMI/ADX chart = Divergence.  
Bearish  signs:  
1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.  
2) Vol is low and we see a decrease in Vol as price is increasing

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC 0.46%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC 0.46% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!

After the influx of  bullish volume  that flowed into  BTC 0.46%  ~28  hrs -0.15%  ago the price has begun to cool off and a  falling wedge  is forming on the charts.  

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC 0.52%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk.

On the 12h chart we can see that  
Bullish  signs:  
1)  Stochastic  was making higher lows for a while (last 4 lows numbered on the chart), while pricing was going down = Divergence.  
2) We also see lower highs on DMI/ADX chart = Divergence.  
Bearish  signs:  
1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC 0.51%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC 0.51% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!

After the influx of  bullish volume  that flowed into  BTC 0.51%  ~28  hrs -0.15%  ago the price has begun to cool off and a  falling wedge  is forming on the charts.  

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

My bias is to the upside, simple because we are due for a relief rally before we resume our descent to the 5000 mark. To put it simply, the market does not wait around and give you the oppurtunity to sell the top, nor buy the low. This does not qualify as a trend reversal to me, simple on the premise of the weakness of the rally. I would expect people to gobble  bitcoin 0.51%  up if this was indeed a reversal, maybe even a 2k candle. This is clearly not the case. Enjoy the relief rally!

1530394146.0,garyreza,Are we going to see a reversal soon?? - Part 3 (continuation),"
The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD 1.31% seq Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th -3.22%  candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC 0.51%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk.

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

1530394146.0,garyreza,Are we going to see a reversal soon?? - Part 3 (continuation),"
The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD 1.31% seq Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th -3.22%  candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC 0.29%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk.

On the 12h chart we can see that  
Bullish  signs:  
1)  Stochastic  was making higher lows for a while (last 4 lows numbered on the chart), while pricing was going down = Divergence.  
2) We also see lower highs on DMI/ADX chart = Divergence.  
Bearish  signs:  
1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.  
2) Vol is low and we see a decrease in Vol as price is increasing

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC 0.32%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC 0.32% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!

After the influx of  bullish volume  that flowed into  BTC 0.37%  ~28  hrs -0.15%  ago the price has begun to cool off and a  falling wedge  is forming on the charts.  

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.

Bearish  Scenario : 
BTC 0.31%  retraces till $6300 - $6250 (Yellow Box) range and then retraces further till $6170 - $6100 (Red Box) 

In past 1 month  100 day MA has acted a solid resistance on 4HR time frame.   
For being  bullish  it needs to make 100 day MA as support.

1530394146.0,garyreza,Are we going to see a reversal soon?? - Part 3 (continuation),"
The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD 1.31% seq 1.77%  which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th -3.22%  candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC 0.31%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk.

On the 12h chart we can see that  
Bullish  signs:  
1)  Stochastic  was making higher lows for a while (last 4 lows numbered on the chart), while pricing was going down = Divergence.  
2) We also see lower highs on DMI/ADX chart = Divergence.  
Bearish  signs:  
1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.  
2) Vol is low and we see a decrease in Vol as price is increasing

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC 0.31%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC 0.31% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!

After the influx of  bullish volume  that flowed into  BTC 0.31%  ~28  hrs -0.15%  ago the price has begun to cool off and a  falling wedge  is forming on the charts.  

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

My bias is to the upside, simple because we are due for a relief rally before we resume our descent to the 5000 mark. To put it simply, the market does not wait around and give you the oppurtunity to sell the top, nor buy the low. This does not qualify as a trend reversal to me, simple on the premise of the weakness of the rally. I would expect people to gobble  bitcoin 0.27%  up if this was indeed a reversal, maybe even a 2k candle. This is clearly not the case. Enjoy the relief rally!

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC 0.26%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC 0.26% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!

After the influx of  bullish volume  that flowed into  BTC 0.25%  ~28  hrs -0.15%  ago the price has begun to cool off and a  falling wedge  is forming on the charts.  

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

My bias is to the upside, simple because we are due for a relief rally before we resume our descent to the 5000 mark. To put it simply, the market does not wait around and give you the oppurtunity to sell the top, nor buy the low. This does not qualify as a trend reversal to me, simple on the premise of the weakness of the rally. I would expect people to gobble  bitcoin 0.23%  up if this was indeed a reversal, maybe even a 2k candle. This is clearly not the case. Enjoy the relief rally!

1530394146.0,garyreza,Are we going to see a reversal soon?? - Part 3 (continuation),"
The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD 1.31% seq 1.77%  which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th -3.22%  candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC 0.18%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk. 

Remember that ""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""

1530394146.0,garyreza,Are we going to see a reversal soon?? - Part 3 (continuation),"
The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD 1.31% seq 1.77%  which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th -3.22%  candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC 0.18%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk. 

Remember that ""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""

On the 12h chart we can see that  
Bullish  signs:  
1)  Stochastic  was making higher lows for a while (last 4 lows numbered on the chart), while pricing was going down = Divergence.  
2) We also see lower highs on DMI/ADX chart = Divergence.  
Bearish  signs:  
1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.  
2) Vol is low and we see a decrease in Vol as price is increasing

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC 0.18%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC 0.18% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!

After the influx of  bullish volume  that flowed into  BTC 0.18%  ~28  hrs -0.15%  ago the price has begun to cool off and a  falling wedge  is forming on the charts.  

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD 1.31% seq 1.77%  which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th -3.22%  candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC 0.18%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk.

On the 12h chart we can see that  
Bullish  signs:  
1)  Stochastic  was making higher lows for a while (last 4 lows numbered on the chart), while pricing was going down = Divergence.  
2) We also see lower highs on DMI/ADX chart = Divergence.  
Bearish  signs:  
1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.  
2) Vol is low and we see a decrease in Vol as price is increasing

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC 0.18%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC 0.18% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!

After the influx of  bullish volume  that flowed into  BTC 0.18%  ~28  hrs -0.15%  ago the price has begun to cool off and a  falling wedge  is forming on the charts.  

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area.

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC 0.20% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!

After the influx of  bullish volume  that flowed into  BTC 0.20%  ~28  hrs -0.15%  ago the price has begun to cool off and a  falling wedge  is forming on the charts.  

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

My bias is to the upside, simple because we are due for a relief rally before we resume our descent to the 5000 mark. To put it simply, the market does not wait around and give you the oppurtunity to sell the top, nor buy the low. This does not qualify as a trend reversal to me, simple on the premise of the weakness of the rally. I would expect people to gobble  bitcoin 0.20%  up if this was indeed a reversal, maybe even a 2k candle. This is clearly not the case. Enjoy the relief rally!

1530394146.0,garyreza,Are we going to see a reversal soon?? - Part 3 (continuation),"
The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD 1.31% seq 1.77%  which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th -3.22%  candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC 0.20%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk. 

Remember that ""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""

On the 12h chart we can see that

1)  Stochastic  was making higher lows for a while (last 4 lows numbered on the chart), while pricing was going down = Divergence.  
2) We also see lower highs on DMI/ADX chart = Divergence.  
Bearish  signs:  
1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.  
2) Vol is low and we see a decrease in Vol as price is increasing

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC 0.20%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).

My bias is to the upside, simple because we are due for a relief rally before we resume our descent to the 5000 mark. To put it simply, the market does not wait around and give you the oppurtunity to sell the top, nor buy the low. This does not qualify as a trend reversal to me, simple on the premise of the weakness of the rally. I would expect people to gobble  bitcoin -0.17%  up if this was indeed a reversal, maybe even a 2k candle. This is clearly not the case. Enjoy the relief rally!

1530394146.0,garyreza,Are we going to see a reversal soon?? - Part 3 (continuation),"
The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  seq Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC -0.30%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk.

On the 12h chart we can see that  
Bullish  signs:  
1)  Stochastic  was making higher lows for a while (last 4 lows numbered on the chart), while pricing was going down = Divergence.  
2) We also see lower highs on DMI/ADX chart = Divergence.  
Bearish  signs:  
1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.  
2) Vol is low and we see a decrease in Vol as price is increasing

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC -0.28%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC -0.28% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!

After the influx of  bullish volume  that flowed into  BTC -0.28%  ~28  hrs -0.15%  ago the price has begun to cool off and a  falling wedge  is forming on the charts.  

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC -0.25%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk.

On the 12h chart we can see that

1)  Stochastic  was making higher lows for a while (last 4 lows numbered on the chart), while pricing was going down = Divergence.  
2) We also see lower highs on DMI/ADX chart = Divergence.  
Bearish  signs:  
1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC -0.25%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC -0.25% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!

After the influx of  bullish volume  that flowed into  BTC -0.25%  ~28  hrs -0.15%  ago the price has begun to cool off and a  falling wedge  is forming on the charts.  

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

My bias is to the upside, simple because we are due for a relief rally before we resume our descent to the 5000 mark. To put it simply, the market does not wait around and give you the oppurtunity to sell the top, nor buy the low. This does not qualify as a trend reversal to me, simple on the premise of the weakness of the rally.

1530394146.0,garyreza,Are we going to see a reversal soon?? - Part 3 (continuation),"
The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD 1.31% seq 1.77%  which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th -3.22%  candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides.

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

1530394146.0,garyreza,Are we going to see a reversal soon?? - Part 3 (continuation),"
The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD 1.31% seq 1.77%  which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th -3.22%  candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC -0.37%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk.

On the 12h chart we can see that  
Bullish  signs:  
1)  Stochastic  was making higher lows for a while (last 4 lows numbered on the chart), while pricing was going down = Divergence.  
2) We also see lower highs on DMI/ADX chart = Divergence.  
Bearish  signs:  
1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.  
2) Vol is low and we see a decrease in Vol as price is increasing

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC -0.37%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC -0.37% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!

 Bullish  Scenario : 
BTC -0.37%  retraces till $6300 - $6250 (Yellow Box) range and then start wave 5 till $6600 - 6670 range ( Green Box) 

Bearish  Scenario : 
BTC -0.37%  retraces till $6300 - $6250 (Yellow Box) range and then retraces further till $6170 - $6100 (Red Box) 

In past 1 month  100 day MA has acted a solid resistance on 4HR time frame.   
For being  bullish  it needs to make 100 day MA as support.

1530394146.0,garyreza,Are we going to see a reversal soon?? - Part 3 (continuation),"
The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD 1.31% seq Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th -3.22%  candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC -0.37%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk.

On the 12h chart we can see that  
Bullish  signs:  
1)  Stochastic  was making higher lows for a while (last 4 lows numbered on the chart), while pricing was going down = Divergence.  
2) We also see lower highs on DMI/ADX chart = Divergence.  
Bearish  signs:  
1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.  
2) Vol is low and we see a decrease in Vol as price is increasing

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC -0.37%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC -0.37% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!

After the influx of  bullish volume  that flowed into  BTC -0.37%  ~28  hrs -0.15%  ago the price has begun to cool off and a  falling wedge  is forming on the charts.  

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

My bias is to the upside, simple because we are due for a relief rally before we resume our descent to the 5000 mark. To put it simply, the market does not wait around and give you the oppurtunity to sell the top, nor buy the low. This does not qualify as a trend reversal to me, simple on the premise of the weakness of the rally.

1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.  
2) Vol is low and we see a decrease in Vol as price is increasing

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC -0.03%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC -0.03% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!! 

Remember that ""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""

After the influx of  bullish volume  that flowed into  BTC -0.04%  ~28  hrs -0.15%  ago the price has begun to cool off and a  falling wedge  is forming on the charts.  

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

1530394146.0,garyreza,Are we going to see a reversal soon?? - Part 3 (continuation),"
The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  seq Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC -0.11%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk.

1530394146.0,garyreza,Are we going to see a reversal soon?? - Part 3 (continuation),"
The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD 1.31% seq Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th -3.22%  candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC -0.34%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk.

On the 12h chart we can see that  
Bullish  signs:  
1)  Stochastic  was making higher lows for a while (last 4 lows numbered on the chart), while pricing was going down = Divergence.  
2) We also see lower highs on DMI/ADX chart = Divergence.  
Bearish  signs:  
1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.  
2) Vol is low and we see a decrease in Vol as price is increasing

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC -0.34%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC -0.34% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!

After the influx of  bullish volume  that flowed into  BTC -0.34%  ~28  hrs -0.15%  ago the price has begun to cool off and a  falling wedge  is forming on the charts.  

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.

On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD 1.31% seq 1.77%  which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th -3.22%  candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC -0.34%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk.

On the 12h chart we can see that  
Bullish  signs:  
1)  Stochastic  was making higher lows for a while (last 4 lows numbered on the chart), while pricing was going down = Divergence.  
2) We also see lower highs on DMI/ADX chart = Divergence.  
Bearish  signs:  
1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.  
2) Vol is low and we see a decrease in Vol as price is increasing

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC -0.34%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC -0.34% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!

After the influx of  bullish volume  that flowed into  BTC -0.34%  ~28  hrs -0.15%  ago the price has begun to cool off and a  falling wedge  is forming on the charts.  

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

My bias is to the upside, simple because we are due for a relief rally before we resume our descent to the 5000 mark. To put it simply, the market does not wait around and give you the oppurtunity to sell the top, nor buy the low. This does not qualify as a trend reversal to me, simple on the premise of the weakness of the rally. I would expect people to gobble  bitcoin -0.34%  up if this was indeed a reversal, maybe even a 2k candle. This is clearly not the case. Enjoy the relief rally!

It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC -0.34%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC -0.34% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!

After the influx of  bullish volume  that flowed into  BTC -0.34%  ~28  hrs -0.15%  ago the price has begun to cool off and a  falling wedge  is forming on the charts.  

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

My bias is to the upside, simple because we are due for a relief rally before we resume our descent to the 5000 mark. To put it simply, the market does not wait around and give you the oppurtunity to sell the top, nor buy the low. This does not qualify as a trend reversal to me, simple on the premise of the weakness of the rally.

1530394146.0,garyreza,Are we going to see a reversal soon?? - Part 3 (continuation),"
The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD 1.31% seq Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th -3.22%  candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC -0.33%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk.

On the 12h chart we can see that

1)  Stochastic  was making higher lows for a while (last 4 lows numbered on the chart), while pricing was going down = Divergence.  
2) We also see lower highs on DMI/ADX chart = Divergence.  
Bearish  signs:  
1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.  
2) Vol is low and we see a decrease in Vol as price is increasing

1530394146.0,garyreza,Are we going to see a reversal soon?? - Part 3 (continuation),"
The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD 1.31% seq 1.77%  which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th -3.22%  candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC -0.32%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk. 

Remember that ""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""

On the 12h chart we can see that  
Bullish  signs:  
1)  Stochastic  was making higher lows for a while (last 4 lows numbered on the chart), while pricing was going down = Divergence.  
2) We also see lower highs on DMI/ADX chart = Divergence.  
Bearish  signs:  
1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.  
2) Vol is low and we see a decrease in Vol as price is increasing

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC -0.32%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC -0.32% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!

After the influx of  bullish volume  that flowed into  BTC -0.19%  ~28  hrs -0.15%  ago the price has begun to cool off and a  falling wedge  is forming on the charts.  

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC -0.19%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk.

On the 12h chart we can see that  
Bullish  signs:  
1)  Stochastic  was making higher lows for a while (last 4 lows numbered on the chart), while pricing was going down = Divergence.  
2) We also see lower highs on DMI/ADX chart = Divergence.  
Bearish  signs:  
1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC -0.19%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC -0.19% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!

After the influx of  bullish volume  that flowed into  BTC -0.20%  ~28  hrs -0.15%  ago the price has begun to cool off and a  falling wedge  is forming on the charts.  

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

My bias is to the upside, simple because we are due for a relief rally before we resume our descent to the 5000 mark. To put it simply, the market does not wait around and give you the oppurtunity to sell the top, nor buy the low. This does not qualify as a trend reversal to me, simple on the premise of the weakness of the rally.

1530394146.0,garyreza,Are we going to see a reversal soon?? - Part 3 (continuation),"
The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD 1.31% seq Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th -3.22%  candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000.

The current candle shows the price ran up to 6379.9 before heavy selling pressure was met.  

In my opinion because the support has become more solidified in the context of Fibonacci levels, Kijun  San 0.38% , Tenkan  San 0.38% , Kumo, as well as Psychological Support it seems very likely we will see a bounce.  

All of the strengthening support in combination with the  bullish  reversal pattern seen forming on the charts leads me to believe that bounce will take place between 6160 -  6273.  

This action is further confirmed by the current positions on the  Stochastic RSI , and the  TRIX .  

If the indicators continue to move downward and blow off some steam from that run then the price would follow down the  falling wedge .  

It should also be noted that the kumo has begun to thin considerably and a twist in the kumo would confirm a reversal and uptrend in price should then begin.  

In the scenario there is a bounce at 6100, I would place my price targets between 6496 - 6597.

Most zones have not changed  since last post for BTC. 
Some of the zones near current price have changed. 
Here is my last analysis, which proved pretty accurate: 




 

These zones are calculated using Fibonacci Ratios of past price moves.  
Fib extensions and retracements are projected forward in time and price. 
If price bounces or reverses, it will probably do so at one of these zones. 

Some zones will match previous highs and lows, since Fibs are derived from the extremes.  
Some zones will not match anything previous, but they are Fib multiples and THOSE are the important ones.  
Zones that are far from current price will be either WIDE or just a LINE. Just a line indicates important Fib Ratio.  

Where prices overlap on the zone lines, drag the Right (price) Axis up to magnify and reduce overlap vertically.  
There are zones above and below the current price range, Drag the Chart up/down to see other zones.  
Drag bottom axis to the left to magnify the candle size to view close up, or to the right to view larger time frame.  

I will update as new zones are defined by upcoming Fibs.

Rsi  must have to come down in order for  bitcoin -0.20%  to jump further high... with  RSI  this high its very difficult for bull to maintain power....As we can see that right now  RSI  is very sensitive to price movements, it must get rid of this, which is an indication that either we will be moving sideways for a day or two for 4h  RSI  to calm down to atleast 50-55 or  btc -0.20%  is  about to drop again.Every single resistance above is different times historic  bitcoin -0.20%  ressistance/support of 2018 and making different patterns. In my opinion we will be moving sideways for  RSI   to calm a bit.

My bias is to the upside, simple because we are due for a relief rally before we resume our descent to the 5000 mark. To put it simply, the market does not wait around and give you the oppurtunity to sell the top, nor buy the low. This does not qualify as a trend reversal to me, simple on the premise of the weakness of the rally. I would expect people to gobble  bitcoin -0.20%  up if this was indeed a reversal, maybe even a 2k candle. This is clearly not the case. Enjoy the relief rally!

 Bullish  Scenario :

Bearish  Scenario : 
BTC -0.32%  retraces till $6300 - $6250 (Yellow Box) range and then retraces further till $6170 - $6100 (Red Box) 

In past 1 month  100 day MA has acted a solid resistance on 4HR time frame.   
For being  bullish  it needs to make 100 day MA as support.

1530394146.0,garyreza,Are we going to see a reversal soon?? - Part 3 (continuation),"
The most important thing in order to predict the reversal point is to find out the downtrend timeframe. For sure its not a downtrend happening on  daily chart  timeframe. So is it 3D or Weekly? 
On the 3D chart we see that the price is siting at the EMA200 (EMA200 is usually the reversal point for the timeframe that the downtrend is happening). So if it was a downtrend on a 3D chart, we might be at the reversal point. However people say that there is  falling wedge  forming which is usually a  bearish  continuation pattern. But we need to remember that lines (support, resistance, neckline, â€¦) in chart patterns are not exactly lines but areas. and the last two tops $11450 and $9700 are not that much far away that they can not be in a same area. I'm not saying that its definitely true but we still have a chance to see the triple bot formation, especially with price sitting at 3D EMA200,  Stochastic  showing triple bots, and  TD 1.31% seq Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   which predicted last two bots correctly is going to mark the  9th Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   candle ( we need to wait till mid week for this). 

The Vol has been decreasing, which can be a good or a bad sign. It can be a good sign because when the Vol is decreasing there is going to be a sudden move, up or down??? depends on the other factors. A triple bot is a consolidation phase and the Vol should decrease, but it doesn't invalidate the  falling wedge  theory. Also  Bollinger bands  has been contracting which again is the consolidation sign.  

Well there is lots of things that need to happen in order to see the reversal, breaking the  support area , on 3D chart  stoch  gets above 20,  macd  turn to be positive, and waiting for the DMI signal.  

If the downtrend is going to be one happening at  weekly timeframe , the reversal point will be around $4000 which is the  EMA  200 region. It should not happen because recovering from a weekly downtrend needs 1-2 years. However recovering from a 3D downtrend can happen in 6 months. As you can see in the picture.  
So to conclude I hope for 3D downtrend, which means the  support area  that we are at right now should hold. but if it breaks down (=breaking down the EMA200 on 3D chart) and we see the confirmation, we should wait for the $4000. I like to say its not likely to happen, but we have to wait and see what market decides. 

It can be a good idea to start buying  BTC -0.32%  in steps, like buying 25% now, and buying in steps if the price goes up or down (either one). This will guarantee you get will buy at a better price with kinda no risk.

On the 12h chart we can see that  
Bullish  signs:  
1)  Stochastic  was making higher lows for a while (last 4 lows numbered on the chart), while pricing was going down = Divergence.  
2) We also see lower highs on DMI/ADX chart = Divergence.  
Bearish  signs:  
1) Price is almost right below the previous support line (which after breaking it, its considered resistance now), and MA50. These two both can act as a strong resistance, together they are even stronger.  
2) Vol is low and we see a decrease in Vol as price is increasing  

Personally I believe on 12h chart the  bearish  sings are stronger than  bullish  ones

Hi everyone. 

I guess the question ""are we going to see a reversal soon?"" is the most important one right now. For sure its will happen at some point, but when? 
right now the price have been in the  support area  that you can see on the chart for a while, today a movement was going to happen, but the mid section (%50 line) of the  support area  acted as some sort of resistance, making us disappointed.  

If we are going to see a reversal soon we sure need to break the upper bond of the  support area , getting back and test it and make sure it will act as resistance after breakout. It will not be enough, but as far as its not happening there will be no chance. So its better to wait for confirmation if you have USD or USDT, but may be risky to sell  BTC -0.32%  right now, as you don't know when the reversal gonna happen.  

Right now based on the  Stochastic  Oscillator we need to cool down a bit, we are seeing these small candles. Whenever you are seeing small candles appearing one after another you should be waiting for a big solid candle (Red or Green depends on many factors).  

To conclude: right now the market is trying to decide which way it wants to move. I will post/comment some supplementary updates based on other time frames so we might be able to predict the future movement of  BTC -0.32% , if its going down to $4000, or if its breaking the support area????!!!!!
