1530231715.0,vin33rocks,Litecoin 2 Arches ..pushes it to $350,"
I think Litecoin will form 2 arches by Dec 2018 .. pushing it to $ 350  
then past that it will move on to  100% gains = $700 by Jan 2019 
then  50% gains to Feb 2019 pushing it into the  $ 1 k club. 
let me know what you think

Title says it all - this is a very long term call and an area we'll consider getting very long and not before.Don't worry there will be plenty of 20% bounces for the day traders to chase and blow out their accounts that's if there's any day traders left in this name. Play safe out there. #trading #fintech #crypto

We expect Litecoin recovery to begins from one of our two demand zones. Bounce zones are around $80 and $50 

Litecoin is an amazing project and coin altogether. With that said we would go in for safer buy after solid uptrend above resistance line. 

Short investors can short it while everyone else can give it a nice hold. 

Enjoy this trade, advice my Crypto Maniacs, but remember to invest only what you can afford to lose or you're going right back to poverty on drop. We are not your financial advisors.
