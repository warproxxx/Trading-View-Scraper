#LTC is trading inside a  wedge  , Yesterday, Bulls broke out of the  wedge  which is a buying signal as long as #LTC can close on a daily candle above 82$. The  bullish trend  will face $90 as a heavy resistance where the red line lies. I would suggest to sell a bit sooner and wait for a daily candle closes above the red line. This will target $109-$115 and then $129 levels. The  pivot point  protects $130 levels. The bulls have defended $75 levels aggressively so far. A daily candle closes below the  wedge  means the bears have broken below $75. TA wise, this pattern targets $60. We have to wait for a clear confirmation of which direction #LTC will decide to move. Therefore, I suggest traders wait for a daily candle close above $82, or a bit higher at $85 before buying the crypto currency.

LTC/USD has lost altitude in the last hours and it has failed to resume the  bullish  momentum towards the sliding line (sl1). The perspective remains  bearish  despite the aggressive rally as the rate is trapped below several very strong dynamic resistance levels. 
A failure to make a valid breakout above the sliding line (sl1) could really send the rate towards the 250% line.

I dont think you realize how fast LTC can move. 10- 15 dollars a day on a regular day. We can be above 100 in like 2 days. Also it is very interesting when the chart looks the worst and im feeling depressed it always reverces. Its like its scripted :D

Yep, we saw a spike in buyers over the last 24 hours. Does that mean we should lose our bananas and start singing the  bullish  tune? No, Absolutely not. I have enough experience to make my own decisions, I do not look to be  bullish  at all costs and I am subjective in my views. So here are my views for you
