I hope everyone is watching  KEYBTC 3.00% . Some ridiculously interesting stuff going on here! 

Uncanny  fractal  business points  BTC              due north. 
Also, on the Binance chart (KEY was just introduced on Binance a few days ago) we basically painted a  fractal  of the history of  Bitcoin              since 2013. 

I made some posts in the past about the possibility of Alt-coin fractals being able to show us the future of the lower  harmonic  ( BTC             ), though nothing I was watching ever played out.  KEYBTC 3.00% , however, is on a whole new level.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin              is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin -1.10%  I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC -1.10%  was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -1.10%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom"" 
- It's dangerous to open long in downtrend to ""catch a falling knife""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -1.10%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

I hope everyone is watching  KEYBTC             . Some ridiculously interesting stuff going on here! 

Uncanny  fractal  business points  BTC              due north. 
Also, on the Binance chart (KEY was just introduced on Binance a few days ago) we basically painted a  fractal  of the history of  Bitcoin              since 2013. 

I made some posts in the past about the possibility of Alt-coin fractals being able to show us the future of the lower  harmonic  ( BTC             ), though nothing I was watching ever played out.  KEYBTC             , however, is on a whole new level.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -1.10%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin              I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC              was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -1.10%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom"" 
- It's dangerous to open long in downtrend to ""catch a falling knife""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -1.10%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

Uncanny  fractal  business points  BTC              due north. 
Also, on the Binance chart (KEY was just introduced on Binance a few days ago) we basically painted a  fractal  of the history of  Bitcoin              since 2013. 

I made some posts in the past about the possibility of Alt-coin fractals being able to show us the future of the lower  harmonic  ( BTC             ), though nothing I was watching ever played out.  KEYBTC 3.65% , however, is on a whole new level.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -1.15%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin -1.15%  I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC -1.15%  was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -1.15%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -1.15%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

I hope everyone is watching  KEYBTC             . Some ridiculously interesting stuff going on here! 

Uncanny  fractal  business points  BTC              due north. 
Also, on the Binance chart (KEY was just introduced on Binance a few days ago) we basically painted a  fractal  of the history of  Bitcoin              since 2013. 

I made some posts in the past about the possibility of Alt-coin fractals being able to show us the future of the lower  harmonic  ( BTC             ), though nothing I was watching ever played out.  KEYBTC             , however, is on a whole new level.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin              is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin              I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC              was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -1.12%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -1.12%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

Uncanny  fractal  business points  BTC              due north. 
Also, on the Binance chart (KEY was just introduced on Binance a few days ago) we basically painted a  fractal  of the history of  Bitcoin              since 2013. 

I made some posts in the past about the possibility of Alt-coin fractals being able to show us the future of the lower  harmonic  ( BTC             ), though nothing I was watching ever played out.  KEYBTC             , however, is on a whole new level.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -1.15%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin              I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC              was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC              made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom"" 
- It's dangerous to open long in downtrend to ""catch a falling knife""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC              and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -1.15%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin -1.15%  I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC -1.15%  was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -1.15%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom"" 
- It's dangerous to open long in downtrend to ""catch a falling knife""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -1.15%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -1.15%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin -1.15%  I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC -1.15%  was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -1.15%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC              and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -1.18%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin -1.18%  I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC -1.18%  was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -1.18%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom"" 
- It's dangerous to open long in downtrend to ""catch a falling knife""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -1.18%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -1.18%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin -1.18%  I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC -1.18%  was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -1.18%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom"" 
- It's dangerous to open long in downtrend to ""catch a falling knife""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC              and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -1.21%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin -1.21%  I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC -1.21%  was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -1.21%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom"" 
- It's dangerous to open long in downtrend to ""catch a falling knife""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -1.21%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -1.21%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin -1.21%  I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC -1.21%  was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -1.21%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom"" 
- It's dangerous to open long in downtrend to ""catch a falling knife""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -1.21%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin              is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin              I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC              was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -1.21%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom"" 
- It's dangerous to open long in downtrend to ""catch a falling knife""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -1.21%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -1.21%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin -1.21%  I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC -1.21%  was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -1.21%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -1.21%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -1.21%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin -1.21%  I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC -1.21%  was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -1.21%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -1.21%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -1.21%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin -1.21%  I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC -1.21%  was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -1.21%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -1.21%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -1.21%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin -1.21%  I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC -1.21%  was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -1.21%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom"" 
- It's dangerous to open long in downtrend to ""catch a falling knife""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -1.21%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -1.10%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin -1.09%  I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC -1.09%  was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -1.09%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom"" 
- It's dangerous to open long in downtrend to ""catch a falling knife""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -1.09%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin              is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin              I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC              was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -1.00%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -1.00%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -0.29%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin -0.18%  I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC -0.18%  was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC 0.17%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom"" 
- It's dangerous to open long in downtrend to ""catch a falling knife""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC 0.29%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -0.26%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin -0.28%  I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC -0.28%  was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -0.28%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom"" 
- It's dangerous to open long in downtrend to ""catch a falling knife""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -0.29%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -0.06%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin              I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC              was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -0.18%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -0.18%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -0.21%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin -0.21%  I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC -0.21%  was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -0.22%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -0.22%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -0.49%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin -0.49%  I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC -0.49%  was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -0.51%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom"" 
- It's dangerous to open long in downtrend to ""catch a falling knife""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -0.51%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -0.28%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin              I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC              was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -0.30%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom"" 
- It's dangerous to open long in downtrend to ""catch a falling knife""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -0.30%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -0.17%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin              I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC              was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -0.21%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom"" 
- It's dangerous to open long in downtrend to ""catch a falling knife""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC              and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -0.28%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin -0.28%  I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC -0.28%  was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -0.28%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -0.28%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -0.34%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin -0.34%  I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC -0.34%  was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -0.34%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom"" 
- It's dangerous to open long in downtrend to ""catch a falling knife""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -0.34%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.

One of my big points of interest during this  bearish  drop of doom was $5,750. With the count shown on this chart, if you take the length of waves 0-3 and stack them onto the close of wave 4 it lands at $5,750. Given that wave 5 usually closes between 62% and 100% the length of 0-3, this number meant quite a bit to me. So when things decided to change direction it wasn't a huge surprise.  

Once we hit that target, there was some substantial  RSI  divergence to be seen on almost every time-line. Shortly after that we broke out of our  RSI wedge  to set up what could very possibly a wave 1 (or an ""A""; time will tell). Now we are currently working on the close of wave 2 (or ""B""). We have already retraced our wave 1 38.2%, which technically satisfies a potential scenario to signal the start of wave 3. The big reason I believe we will continue to retrace to the 50% of wave 1 is that it appears that 4-hour  RSI  wants to come down further to its new post-wedge resistance line. You can see that line on the chart. I think that we may have to retrace a little further to set up  RSI  prior to making a push towards the 1.62 ext of wave one for the close of 3 ($7,000).

					Here is a closer look at the potential count for our current impulse. As I mentioned above, we have already hit the 38.2% retracement which could imply lateral movement until we hit the support floor on our 4-hour RSI. If it decides to make a move down fairly quickly, there is also room to hit the 50% retracement before attempting a wave 3 break of the large top-side resistance at $6,420-$6,450.

 Bitcoin -0.60%  is having some  bullish  signals but since its pump we have been on a retracement and once again but we just have to find the right support and know when we will be getting out of the  wedge  and once we get out there is another downward trend we would have to get out from and I think we will be testing it at 6600-6800 USD. So we have three supports, we tested the first one at 6254 USD and had a quite small bounce to upper 6320 area but lets see how strong this support is, if this support is broken then we will move to the next support at 6193 USD we will see if we are getting out of the  wedge  from this support, if we break this support and bears stand their ground, then we will move to the next support which will be at 5911 USD.  

However my prediction is that we will test the support at 6254 USD once again after which we should bounce and get out of the  wedge  and test the downward trend which we have waiting out side the  wedge  and we will see if the bulls are good enough to break the resistance.  

Good Luck, Traders!

The first chart of  Bitcoin -0.60%  I posted was was an overall look at the speculation bubble that  BTC -0.60%  was and still is today.  For FY 2018, BTC/USD is on a downtrend.  As Indicated in my handle, I'm a fan of the Fibonacci number sequences in general; however, I formulated my own ""compacted"" version of the sequence using units of measurement of ""100.00"" rather than the tool provided by Trading View.  In as much as objective observation goes into understanding my compacted fib levels, I provided not only the lines of  support and resistance  calculated using this system, but the ascending and descending fib levels of 0,1,1,2,3,5 with directional arrows such that any outside observer could understand the methodology used.  The horizontal lines established using this system highlight various ranges of BTC/USD valuations within the monthly chart provided with 30 minute increments. Of interest, in the time frame study, range # 3 in both the ascending and descending lines are quite telling as well as range # 5 in the descending.  A more detailed analysis can be conveyed onto the the graph given; however, it's theoretical purpose is to establish ranges of predictable price actions and highlight their general direction over shorter time periods rather than a full year.

Very clean  descending channel  in a descending traingle. 

This looks so  bullish  to me.  

We had a clean bounce on that bottom  trend line .  
We had a bounce on that order block. 
But also we had a bounce at the 0.618 (max retracement zone) 
As you can see in the chart. 

Maybe we can go 1 leg down.. I don't quite believe in it myself but I would never rule it out. 

But I will put a smaller TimeFrame chart in the comment here below,

Hi all, 

BTC -0.60%  made it's usual pump. Now almost touching the downtrend resistance line. But still in  descending channel ...  

On top, hidden bear divergence on the daily so I keep looking at the $6,160/ $5,850 levels with attention before going thinking going long 

This is the perfect moment to be extra cautious, why? 
- It' s dangerous to open short close to ""the crowd's bottom""

1530464680.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 126),"
Yesterday we went back to the drawing board after the trailing stop losses were triggered on my ETH:USD and BTC:USD shorts. I am 99% certain that we are yet to find a bottom, therefore I am preparing for the next  bearish  entry.  

If you missed yesterday’s post I would recommend giving it a read. I outlined major areas of resistance and it should give you a good idea about how to start the process of finding a trade.  

Today is Sunday and it is the first of the month, so this post will be about analyzing the longer term time frames. The current rally found resistance at $6,500 and is retesting $6,250 support. The long wick which pushed the price from $6,500 down to $6,400 is a bad sign for the bulls. It tells me that the FOMO buyers were easily thwarted by the bears at that level.  

The weekly candle is going to close in a few hours. If the price holds above $5,823 then we would get a nice tweezer bottom. I would expect that to provide the support needed for the bulls to breakthrough the  trendline  (red). From there a bounce to $7,275 would be likely.  








The well defined  support and resistance  areas combined with the downtrend line is why I would be expecting a bounce to $7,275. If that does happen then I would be viewing it as a high probably short sell.  








The Stochastic on weekly chart also had it’s first crossover below 11 since 1-12-15. That effectively marked the bottom of the last bear market prior to the year of consolidation.  








This indicator made me reconsider my confidence level in regards to the market finding a bottom. If the  Stochastic  is marking the bottom like it did in 2015 then we still have a long time to consolidate. If we range between $5,823 and $7,275 over the next 3+ months then I will start calling for the bottom.  

Until we see some serious capitulation and/or months of ranging in a tight zone then I will remain confidently  bearish .  

Based on the likelihood of a  tweezer bottom  and the recent cross on the  Stochastic  I am expecting a strong bounce from here. However, I am not nearly confident enough in that projection to bet against the trend. Therefore I will be waiting to sell the bounce on  BTC -0.60%  and alts. If you are not currently in a position I would recommend doing the same.
