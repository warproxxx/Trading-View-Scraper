ETH has fallen enough, little uptrend should happen

ETH 4h: I am starting to see a  three drives  pattern on the 4h chart on the Ether (you can find an example here https://learn.tradimo.com/advanced-chart-patterns/three-drives). If this is indeed a validated  Three drives  pattern, expect a bounce up to the 61.8%  Fibonacci retracement  of the whole move lower which is at $543.5 .  The trade idea is no longer valid and the stop loss has to be triggered if we trade below $389. No change in my view about a broader decline; if it happens, this is just a relief rally. #notaninvestmentadvice #pleaedoyourownresearch #mypersonalview

Good support at the 370 region.  

also ETH is falling on lower  volume .. Possible chance to accumulate

Now, we are approaching the price range of 370-400. Though it's a mirrored level, I think buyers do not have the strength to hold it, against the background of falling  BTC -0.04% . 
Therefore, I predict that we test it or with a rebound to the price zone 450-500, or immediately. 
The price zone 280-310 - has a large accumulation of buyers, which in the past due to this accumulation made a move up to $ 1,400. 
I expect from this zone a rebound to: 
1) $ 380-400 
2) $ 450-500.

How confusing ETH/the whole crypto market can be these days? 

Personally imo*, and by the way it looks for now, this is highly likely to be a  falling wedge (I repeat HIGHLY likely!). This would be a good long shot at ETH, with a possible stop-loss, if and only if the bottom channel of the  Falling wedge  is decisively broken(Great risk/reward shot here). Why would this be highly unlikely? Due to the number of times in the past few weeks, ETH has been respecting the said channel(red  rectangle  areas). 
I do think however, that this is a typical whale play in order to tap out/Stop-loss all the weak hands, before the price can move up. The current channel that the price is moving in(unless there's a breakout on D-the falling peaks pattern drawn on the graph), it just does not make sense that Etherium , would move more down and follow the  falling wedge  bottom channel because it would take quite a long time to reach the next ret/support 0.93 at 388. And this would just be a  falling wedge  inside a  falling wedge , which should have a massively  bullish  outcome. 
Pair this with the recent uptrend in the  BTCUSDLONGS              , and the fact that etherium has been in the past few month alwaays a step ahead of  btc              , I'm definitely long this time on etherium- playing in for the bull trap. 

Overall, if the week ends with a green candle(above 454), I'd see a good probability of a  bullish  reversal and a breakout out of the  falling wedge (Targets 586/714). This market is not dead, yet. 

Do comment your thoughts, additions or critics, as this is quite a critical time for etherium. 
-Happy trading folks-
