Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000 

This is just an idea. 

Never forget your SL !

The break of this range today will dictate momentum for this week as it is time for the bulls to prove follow through or shut up.  
Healthy daily consolidation so far which is a great setup for follow through, but bulls have disappointed on many occasions the last few weeks.  
The current setup will allow for a trade entry on a break in whichever direction, keeping in mind we have been seeing some fake outs.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin -0.11%  once again. 

Bitcoin -0.11%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin -0.11%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin -0.11%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin -0.11%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin -0.11%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin -0.11%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin -0.11%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin -0.11%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin -0.11%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD -0.11%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC -0.11%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin -0.11%  core ( BTC -0.11% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity             .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO 0.71%  Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”

 Bitcoin -0.11%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin -0.11%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin -0.11% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin -0.11%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin -0.11%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin -0.11%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin -0.11%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin -0.11%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin -0.11%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin -0.11%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin -0.11%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

 Bitcoin -0.14%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin -0.11%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin -0.11% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin -0.11%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin -0.11%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin -0.11%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin -0.11%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin -0.11%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin -0.11%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin -0.11%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin -0.11%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin -0.11%  once again. 

Bitcoin -0.11%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin -0.11%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin -0.11%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin -0.11%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin -0.11%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin -0.11%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin -0.11%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin -0.11%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin -0.11%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD -0.11%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC -0.11%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin -0.11%  core ( BTC -0.11% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity             .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO 0.71%  Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”   

Philippines’ Economic Zone Creating Crypto Regulations, Licensing 25 Exchanges 
The authority of the Filipino government-owned economic zone is drafting regulations for cryptocurrencies and planning to limit the number of licenses it issues to 25. Other rules include the requirement for each crypto exchange to invest at least US$1 million within 2 years. The authority has reportedly received about 60 applications from crypto companies so far.

Currently  Bitcoin -0.11%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin -0.11%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin -0.11%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin -0.11%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin -0.11%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin -0.11%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD -0.11%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC -0.11%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin -0.11%  core ( BTC -0.11% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity             .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO 0.71%  Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”

 Bitcoin -0.11%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

1530523729.0,DvdGoldberg,Down to 5600 and then up to 7200,"
As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin -0.11%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin -0.11% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin -0.11%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin -0.11%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin -0.11%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin -0.11%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin -0.11%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin -0.11%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin -0.11%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin -0.11%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000 

This is just an idea.

Healthy daily consolidation so far which is a great setup for follow through, but bulls have disappointed on many occasions the last few weeks.  
The current setup will allow for a trade entry on a break in whichever direction, keeping in mind we have been seeing some fake outs.  
Clear higher lows and lower highs to use as stop levels for those wanting to keep a tight leash on the trade.

Currently  Bitcoin -0.11%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin -0.11%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin -0.11%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin -0.11%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin -0.11%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin              developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin             . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin              reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin              has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin              touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin              closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin              did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin              will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 0.08%  once again. 

Bitcoin 0.08%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 0.08%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 0.08%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 0.08%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 0.08%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.08%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.08%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.08%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 0.08%   somewhat clearer.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD              reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC              down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.

Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin              core ( BTC             ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity             .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO              Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”

 Bitcoin              is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

"" 

So,  bitcoin              developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin             . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin              reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin              has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin              touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin              closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin              did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA.

Currently  Bitcoin 0.08%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 0.08%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.08%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.08%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.08%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend.

Bitcoin 0.08%  core ( BTC 0.08% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity 1.07% .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO              Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”

The authority of the Filipino government-owned economic zone is drafting regulations for cryptocurrencies and planning to limit the number of licenses it issues to 25.

 Bitcoin -0.04%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin -0.06%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin -0.06% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin -0.06%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin -0.06%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin -0.06%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin -0.06%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin -0.06%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin -0.06%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin -0.06%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin -0.06%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000 

This is just an idea.

Healthy daily consolidation so far which is a great setup for follow through, but bulls have disappointed on many occasions the last few weeks.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin -0.06%  once again. 

Bitcoin -0.06%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin -0.06%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin -0.06%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin -0.06%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin -0.06%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin -0.06%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin -0.06%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin -0.06%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin -0.06%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD -0.06%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC -0.06%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.

So,  bitcoin -0.06%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin -0.06% .

Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin -0.06%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin -0.06%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin -0.06%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin -0.06%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin -0.06%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin -0.06%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin -0.06%  once again. 

Bitcoin -0.06%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin -0.06%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin -0.06%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin -0.06%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin -0.06%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin -0.06%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin -0.06%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin -0.06%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin -0.06%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD -0.06%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC -0.06%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin -0.06%  core ( BTC -0.06% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity 1.07% .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO 0.71%  Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”

 Bitcoin -0.06%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin -0.06%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin -0.06% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin -0.06%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin -0.06%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin -0.06%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin -0.06%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin -0.06%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin -0.06%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin -0.06%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin -0.06%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it.

 Bitcoin 0.02%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin 0.02%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 0.02% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 0.02%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 0.02%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 0.02%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 0.02%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 0.02%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 0.02%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 0.02%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 0.02%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000

 Bitcoin              in a tightening pattern on the 4 hour which is showing up as a daily  inside bar .  
The break of this range today will dictate momentum for this week as it is time for the bulls to prove follow through or shut up.  
Healthy daily consolidation so far which is a great setup for follow through, but bulls have disappointed on many occasions the last few weeks.  
The current setup will allow for a trade entry on a break in whichever direction, keeping in mind we have been seeing some fake outs.  
Clear higher lows and lower highs to use as stop levels for those wanting to keep a tight leash on the trade.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 0.02%  once again. 

Bitcoin 0.02%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 0.02%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 0.02%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 0.02%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 0.02%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.02%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.02%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.02%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 0.02%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD              reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC              down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin              core ( BTC             ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity             .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO              Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”   

Philippines’ Economic Zone Creating Crypto Regulations, Licensing 25 Exchanges 
The authority of the Filipino government-owned economic zone is drafting regulations for cryptocurrencies and planning to limit the number of licenses it issues to 25. Other rules include the requirement for each crypto exchange to invest at least US$1 million within 2 years. The authority has reportedly received about 60 applications from crypto companies so far.

So,  bitcoin              developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin             .

A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900.

TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal.

After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 0.02%  once again. 

Bitcoin 0.02%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 0.02%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 0.02%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 0.02%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 0.02%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.02%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.02%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.02%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 0.02%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD              reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC              down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin              core ( BTC             ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity             .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO              Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”

 Bitcoin 0.15%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin 0.16%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 0.16% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 0.16%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 0.16%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 0.16%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 0.16%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 0.16%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 0.16%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 0.16%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 0.16%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000 

This is just an idea.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin              developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin             . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin              reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin              has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin              touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin              closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin              did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin              will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000 

This is just an idea. 

Never forget your SL !

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin              once again. 

Bitcoin              has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin              has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin              has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin              is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin              has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin              seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin              tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin              have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin               somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD              reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC              down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin              core ( BTC             ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity             .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO              Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”   

Philippines’ Economic Zone Creating Crypto Regulations, Licensing 25 Exchanges 
The authority of the Filipino government-owned economic zone is drafting regulations for cryptocurrencies and planning to limit the number of licenses it issues to 25. Other rules include the requirement for each crypto exchange to invest at least US$1 million within 2 years. The authority has reportedly received about 60 applications from crypto companies so far.

 Bitcoin 0.43%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

So,  bitcoin              developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin             . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin              reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900.

Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin              touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels).

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin              closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin              did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 0.41%  once again. 

Bitcoin 0.41%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 0.41%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 0.41%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 0.41%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 0.41%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.41%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.41%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.41%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely.

Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 0.37%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin 0.37%  core ( BTC 0.37% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity 1.07% .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO 0.71%  Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”   

Philippines’ Economic Zone Creating Crypto Regulations, Licensing 25 Exchanges 
The authority of the Filipino government-owned economic zone is drafting regulations for cryptocurrencies and planning to limit the number of licenses it issues to 25. Other rules include the requirement for each crypto exchange to invest at least US$1 million within 2 years. The authority has reportedly received about 60 applications from crypto companies so far.

 Bitcoin 0.35%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin 0.34%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 0.34% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 0.34%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 0.34%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 0.34%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 0.34%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 0.34%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 0.34%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 0.34%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 0.34%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000 

This is just an idea.

Healthy daily consolidation so far which is a great setup for follow through, but bulls have disappointed on many occasions the last few weeks.  
The current setup will allow for a trade entry on a break in whichever direction, keeping in mind we have been seeing some fake outs.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 0.33%  once again. 

Bitcoin 0.33%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 0.33%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 0.33%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 0.33%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 0.33%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.33%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.33%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.33%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 0.33%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin              closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin              did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin              will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 0.24%  once again. 

Bitcoin 0.24%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 0.24%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 0.24%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 0.24%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 0.24%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.24%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.24%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.24%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 0.24%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD              reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC              down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin              core ( BTC             ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity             .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO              Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”

 Bitcoin 0.30%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin              developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin             . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin              reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin              has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin              touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin              closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin              did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin              will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20.

Currently  Bitcoin 0.38%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 0.38%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.38%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.38%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.38%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good.

 Bitcoin 0.34%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin              developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin             . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin              reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin              has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin              touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin              closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin              did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin              will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000 

This is just an idea.

Healthy daily consolidation so far which is a great setup for follow through, but bulls have disappointed on many occasions the last few weeks.  
The current setup will allow for a trade entry on a break in whichever direction, keeping in mind we have been seeing some fake outs.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 0.33%  once again. 

Bitcoin 0.33%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 0.33%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 0.33%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 0.33%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 0.33%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.33%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.33%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.33%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 0.33%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD 0.33%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 0.33%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin 0.33%  core ( BTC 0.33% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity             .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO              Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”   

Philippines’ Economic Zone Creating Crypto Regulations, Licensing 25 Exchanges 
The authority of the Filipino government-owned economic zone is drafting regulations for cryptocurrencies and planning to limit the number of licenses it issues to 25. Other rules include the requirement for each crypto exchange to invest at least US$1 million within 2 years. The authority has reportedly received about 60 applications from crypto companies so far.

So,  bitcoin 0.36%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 0.36% .

TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000 

This is just an idea. 

Never forget your SL !

 Bitcoin 0.36%  in a tightening pattern on the 4 hour which is showing up as a daily  inside bar .  
The break of this range today will dictate momentum for this week as it is time for the bulls to prove follow through or shut up.  
Healthy daily consolidation so far which is a great setup for follow through, but bulls have disappointed on many occasions the last few weeks.  
The current setup will allow for a trade entry on a break in whichever direction, keeping in mind we have been seeing some fake outs.  
Clear higher lows and lower highs to use as stop levels for those wanting to keep a tight leash on the trade.  
Lots of patience waiting for this break, likely sometime within the next 8 hours or so. 
Watch for  volume  to indicate potential follow through when the break occurs. Be skeptical of a low  volume  break.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 0.36%  once again. 

Bitcoin 0.36%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 0.36%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 0.36%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 0.36%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 0.36%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.36%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.36%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.36%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 0.36%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD 0.36%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 0.36%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin 0.36%  core ( BTC 0.36% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity 1.07% .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO 0.71%  Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”

 Bitcoin 0.36%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin 0.36%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 0.36% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 0.36%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 0.36%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 0.36%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 0.36%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 0.36%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 0.36%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 0.36%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 0.36%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

 Bitcoin 0.45%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin              developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin             . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin              reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin              has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin              touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin              closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin              did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin              will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit)

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin              once again. 

Bitcoin              has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin              has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin              has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin              is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin              has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin              seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin              tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin              have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin               somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD 0.79%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 0.79%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin 0.79%  core ( BTC 0.79% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity             .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO              Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”   

Philippines’ Economic Zone Creating Crypto Regulations, Licensing 25 Exchanges 
The authority of the Filipino government-owned economic zone is drafting regulations for cryptocurrencies and planning to limit the number of licenses it issues to 25. Other rules include the requirement for each crypto exchange to invest at least US$1 million within 2 years. The authority has reportedly received about 60 applications from crypto companies so far.

 Bitcoin 0.83%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.

"" 

So,  bitcoin 0.79%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 0.79% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 0.79%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 0.79%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 0.79%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 0.79%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 0.79%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 0.79%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 0.79%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 0.79%  once again. 

Bitcoin 0.79%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 0.79%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 0.79%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 0.79%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 0.79%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.79%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.79%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.79%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD 0.79%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 0.79%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin 0.79%  core ( BTC 0.79% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity 1.07% .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO 0.71%  Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”   

Philippines’ Economic Zone Creating Crypto Regulations, Licensing 25 Exchanges 
The authority of the Filipino government-owned economic zone is drafting regulations for cryptocurrencies and planning to limit the number of licenses it issues to 25.

 Bitcoin 0.79%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin 0.79%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 0.79% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 0.79%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 0.79%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 0.79%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 0.79%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 0.79%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 0.79%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 0.79%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 0.79%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000 

This is just an idea. 

Never forget your SL !

 Bitcoin 0.68%  in a tightening pattern on the 4 hour which is showing up as a daily  inside bar .  
The break of this range today will dictate momentum for this week as it is time for the bulls to prove follow through or shut up.  
Healthy daily consolidation so far which is a great setup for follow through, but bulls have disappointed on many occasions the last few weeks.  
The current setup will allow for a trade entry on a break in whichever direction, keeping in mind we have been seeing some fake outs.  
Clear higher lows and lower highs to use as stop levels for those wanting to keep a tight leash on the trade.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 0.63%  once again. 

Bitcoin 0.63%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 0.63%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 0.63%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 0.63%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 0.63%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.63%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.63%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.63%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 0.63%   somewhat clearer.

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 0.47%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 0.47%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 0.47%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 0.47%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 0.47%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 0.47%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 0.47%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 0.47%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 0.47%  once again. 

Bitcoin 0.47%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 0.47%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 0.47%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 0.47%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 0.47%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.47%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.47%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.47%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 0.47%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD 0.47%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 0.47%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin 0.47%  core ( BTC 0.47% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity 1.07% .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO 0.71%  Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”

 Bitcoin 0.60%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin 0.61%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 0.61% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 0.61%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 0.61%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 0.61%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels).

This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 0.61%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 0.61%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 0.61%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA.

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.61%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.61%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.61%  have seen a great demand bounce.

No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO 0.71%  Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”   

Philippines’ Economic Zone Creating Crypto Regulations, Licensing 25 Exchanges 
The authority of the Filipino government-owned economic zone is drafting regulations for cryptocurrencies and planning to limit the number of licenses it issues to 25. Other rules include the requirement for each crypto exchange to invest at least US$1 million within 2 years. The authority has reportedly received about 60 applications from crypto companies so far.

 Bitcoin 0.42%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin 0.41%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 0.41% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 0.41%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 0.41%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 0.41%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 0.41%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 0.41%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 0.41%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 0.41%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 0.41%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000 

This is just an idea.

Healthy daily consolidation so far which is a great setup for follow through, but bulls have disappointed on many occasions the last few weeks.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 0.46%  once again. 

Bitcoin 0.46%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 0.46%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 0.46%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 0.46%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 0.46%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.46%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.46%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.46%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 0.46%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD 0.46%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 0.46%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin 0.46%  core ( BTC 0.46% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity 1.07% .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal.

"" 

So,  bitcoin 0.48%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 0.48% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 0.48%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 0.48%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 0.48%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 0.48%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 0.48%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 0.48%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 0.48%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 0.48%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000 

This is just an idea.

The break of this range today will dictate momentum for this week as it is time for the bulls to prove follow through or shut up.  
Healthy daily consolidation so far which is a great setup for follow through, but bulls have disappointed on many occasions the last few weeks.  
The current setup will allow for a trade entry on a break in whichever direction, keeping in mind we have been seeing some fake outs.  
Clear higher lows and lower highs to use as stop levels for those wanting to keep a tight leash on the trade.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 0.55%  once again. 

Bitcoin 0.55%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 0.55%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 0.55%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 0.55%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 0.55%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.55%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.55%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.55%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 0.55%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD 0.56%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 0.56%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin 0.56%  core ( BTC 0.56% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity 1.07% .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO              Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”

 Bitcoin 0.57%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin 0.60%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 0.60% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 0.60%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 0.60%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 0.60%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 0.60%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 0.60%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 0.60%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 0.60%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 0.60%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Currently  Bitcoin 0.63%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 0.63%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.63%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.63%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.63%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend.

 Bitcoin 0.73%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin              developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin             . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin              reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin              has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin              touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin              closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin              did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin              will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 0.58%  once again. 

Bitcoin 0.58%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 0.58%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 0.58%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 0.58%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 0.58%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.58%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.58%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.58%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 0.58%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD 0.58%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 0.58%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin 0.58%  core ( BTC 0.58% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity 1.07% .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO              Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”   

Philippines’ Economic Zone Creating Crypto Regulations, Licensing 25 Exchanges 
The authority of the Filipino government-owned economic zone is drafting regulations for cryptocurrencies and planning to limit the number of licenses it issues to 25. Other rules include the requirement for each crypto exchange to invest at least US$1 million within 2 years. The authority has reportedly received about 60 applications from crypto companies so far.

So,  bitcoin 0.61%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 0.61% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit).

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 0.61%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 0.61%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 0.61%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels).

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 0.61%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 0.61%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 0.61%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20.

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.73%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.73%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.73%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 0.73%   somewhat clearer.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD              reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC              down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin              core ( BTC             ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity             .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO              Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”

 Bitcoin 0.70%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin 0.66%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 0.66% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 0.66%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 0.66%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 0.66%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 0.66%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 0.66%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 0.66%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 0.66%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 0.66%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000 

This is just an idea.

The break of this range today will dictate momentum for this week as it is time for the bulls to prove follow through or shut up.  
Healthy daily consolidation so far which is a great setup for follow through, but bulls have disappointed on many occasions the last few weeks.  
The current setup will allow for a trade entry on a break in whichever direction, keeping in mind we have been seeing some fake outs.  
Clear higher lows and lower highs to use as stop levels for those wanting to keep a tight leash on the trade.

Currently  Bitcoin 0.69%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 0.69%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.69%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.69%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.69%  have seen a great demand bounce.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin              developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin             . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin              reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin              has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin              touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin              closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin              did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin              will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000

Healthy daily consolidation so far which is a great setup for follow through, but bulls have disappointed on many occasions the last few weeks.  
The current setup will allow for a trade entry on a break in whichever direction, keeping in mind we have been seeing some fake outs.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 0.90%  once again. 

Bitcoin 0.90%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 0.90%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 0.90%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 0.90%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 0.90%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.90%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.90%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.90%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 0.90%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD 0.90%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 0.90%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin 0.90%  core ( BTC 0.90% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity             .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO 0.71%  Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”

 Bitcoin 0.86%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

So,  bitcoin 0.86%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 0.86% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday.

A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900.

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 0.86%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 0.86%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 0.86%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA.

Currently  Bitcoin 0.86%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 0.86%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.86%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.86%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.86%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend.

BTCUSD 0.86%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend.

Bitcoin 0.86%  core ( BTC 0.86% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity 1.07% .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO 0.71%  Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”

The authority of the Filipino government-owned economic zone is drafting regulations for cryptocurrencies and planning to limit the number of licenses it issues to 25.

 Bitcoin 0.86%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin 0.86%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 0.86% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 0.86%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 0.86%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 0.86%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 0.86%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 0.86%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 0.86%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 0.86%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 0.86%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000 

This is just an idea.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 0.87%  once again. 

Bitcoin 0.87%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 0.87%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 0.87%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 0.87%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 0.87%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 0.87%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 0.87%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 0.87%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 0.87%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD 0.87%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 0.87%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.

From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin 0.99%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 0.99% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 0.99%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 0.99%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 0.99%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 0.99%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 0.99%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 0.99%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 0.99%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 0.99%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin              once again. 

Bitcoin              has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin              has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin              has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin              is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin              has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin              seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin              tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin              have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin               somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD 1.53%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 1.53%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin 1.53%  core ( BTC 1.53% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity             .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO 0.71%  Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”

 Bitcoin 1.90%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin 1.88%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 1.88% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 1.88%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 1.88%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 1.88%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 1.88%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 1.88%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 1.88%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 1.88%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 1.88%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it.

Currently  Bitcoin 2.46%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 2.46%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 2.46%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 2.46%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 2.46%  have seen a great demand bounce.

Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD 2.30%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 2.30%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario.

 Bitcoin 2.57%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin 2.68%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 2.68% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 2.68%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 2.68%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 2.68%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 2.68%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 2.68%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 2.68%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 2.68%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 2.68%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

BUY: at ~6500

 Bitcoin 2.90%  in a tightening pattern on the 4 hour which is showing up as a daily  inside bar .  
The break of this range today will dictate momentum for this week as it is time for the bulls to prove follow through or shut up.  
Healthy daily consolidation so far which is a great setup for follow through, but bulls have disappointed on many occasions the last few weeks.  
The current setup will allow for a trade entry on a break in whichever direction, keeping in mind we have been seeing some fake outs.  
Clear higher lows and lower highs to use as stop levels for those wanting to keep a tight leash on the trade.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 3.15%  once again. 

Bitcoin 3.15%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 3.15%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 3.15%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 3.15%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 3.15%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 3.15%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 3.15%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 3.15%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 3.15%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD              reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC              down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin              core ( BTC             ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity             .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO              Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”   

Philippines’ Economic Zone Creating Crypto Regulations, Licensing 25 Exchanges 
The authority of the Filipino government-owned economic zone is drafting regulations for cryptocurrencies and planning to limit the number of licenses it issues to 25. Other rules include the requirement for each crypto exchange to invest at least US$1 million within 2 years. The authority has reportedly received about 60 applications from crypto companies so far.

And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 3.30% .

TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal.

In addition,  bitcoin 3.30%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 3.88%  once again. 

Bitcoin 3.88%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 3.88%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 3.88%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 3.88%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 3.88%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 3.88%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 3.88%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 3.88%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 3.88%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD 3.88%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 3.88%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin 3.88%  core ( BTC 3.88% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity 1.07% .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO              Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”

 Bitcoin 4.02%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin 4.03%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 4.03% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 4.03%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 4.03%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 4.03%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 4.03%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 4.03%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 4.03%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 4.03%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 4.03%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000 

This is just an idea.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin 4.19%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 4.19% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 4.19%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 4.19%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 4.19%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 4.19%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 4.19%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 4.19%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 4.19%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 4.19%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000 

This is just an idea.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 4.04%  once again. 

Bitcoin 4.04%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 4.04%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 4.04%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 4.04%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 4.04%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 4.04%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 4.04%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 4.04%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 4.04%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD 3.88%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 3.88%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin 3.88%  core ( BTC 3.88% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity 1.07% .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO 0.71%  Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”   

Philippines’ Economic Zone Creating Crypto Regulations, Licensing 25 Exchanges 
The authority of the Filipino government-owned economic zone is drafting regulations for cryptocurrencies and planning to limit the number of licenses it issues to 25. Other rules include the requirement for each crypto exchange to invest at least US$1 million within 2 years. The authority has reportedly received about 60 applications from crypto companies so far.

 Bitcoin 3.59%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 3.58%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin 3.58%  core ( BTC 3.58% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity             .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO 0.71%  Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”   

Philippines’ Economic Zone Creating Crypto Regulations, Licensing 25 Exchanges 
The authority of the Filipino government-owned economic zone is drafting regulations for cryptocurrencies and planning to limit the number of licenses it issues to 25. Other rules include the requirement for each crypto exchange to invest at least US$1 million within 2 years. The authority has reportedly received about 60 applications from crypto companies so far. 
“There are many operating scammers who set up an exchange with very little capital and they are victimizing investors…We do not want the Philippines to be a haven for scammers even if these scams are happening abroad. That’s why thro

 Bitcoin 3.48%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin 3.46%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 3.46% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 3.46%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 3.46%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 3.46%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 3.46%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 3.46%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 3.46%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 3.46%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 3.46%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000 

This is just an idea.

Healthy daily consolidation so far which is a great setup for follow through, but bulls have disappointed on many occasions the last few weeks.  
The current setup will allow for a trade entry on a break in whichever direction, keeping in mind we have been seeing some fake outs.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 3.42%  once again. 

Bitcoin 3.42%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 3.42%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 3.42%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 3.42%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 3.42%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 3.42%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 3.42%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 3.42%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 3.42%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

So,  bitcoin              developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin             .

Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin              touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels).

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin              closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin              did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin              will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 3.20%  once again. 

Bitcoin 3.20%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 3.20%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 3.20%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 3.20%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 3.20%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 3.20%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 3.20%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 3.20%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 3.20%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD 3.20%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 3.20%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin 3.20%  core ( BTC 3.20% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity 1.07% .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO              Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”

 Bitcoin 3.23%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin              developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin             . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin              reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin              has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin              touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin              closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin              did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin              will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20.

Currently  Bitcoin 3.34%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 3.34%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 3.34%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 3.34%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 3.34%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely.

 Bitcoin 3.65%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin              developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin             . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin              reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin              has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin              touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin              closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin              did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin              will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 3.77%  once again. 

Bitcoin 3.77%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 3.77%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 3.77%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 3.77%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 3.77%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 3.77%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 3.77%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 3.77%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 3.77%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD              reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC              down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin              core ( BTC             ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity             .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO              Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”   

Philippines’ Economic Zone Creating Crypto Regulations, Licensing 25 Exchanges 
The authority of the Filipino government-owned economic zone is drafting regulations for cryptocurrencies and planning to limit the number of licenses it issues to 25. Other rules include the requirement for each crypto exchange to invest at least US$1 million within 2 years. The authority has reportedly received about 60 applications from crypto companies so far. 
“There are many operating scammers who set up an exchange with very little capital and they are victimizing investors…We do not want the Philippines to be a haven for scammers even if these scams are happening abroad. That’s why thro

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick.

"" 

So,  bitcoin              developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin             . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin              reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin              has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin              touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin              closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin              did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin              will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it.

 Bitcoin              in a tightening pattern on the 4 hour which is showing up as a daily  inside bar .  
The break of this range today will dictate momentum for this week as it is time for the bulls to prove follow through or shut up.  
Healthy daily consolidation so far which is a great setup for follow through, but bulls have disappointed on many occasions the last few weeks.  
The current setup will allow for a trade entry on a break in whichever direction, keeping in mind we have been seeing some fake outs.  
Clear higher lows and lower highs to use as stop levels for those wanting to keep a tight leash on the trade.  
Lots of patience waiting for this break, likely sometime within the next 8 hours or so.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 3.95%  once again. 

Bitcoin 3.95%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 3.95%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 3.95%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 3.95%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 3.95%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 3.95%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 3.95%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 3.95%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 3.95%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD 3.96%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 3.96%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin 3.96%  core ( BTC 3.96% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity 1.07% .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO -1.90%  Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”

 Bitcoin              is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin              developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin             . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin              reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin              has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin              touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin              closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin              did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin              will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Currently  Bitcoin 3.97%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 3.97%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 3.97%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 3.97%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 3.97%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good.

3 hours ago




 Bitcoin 3.98%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin 3.88%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 3.88% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 3.88%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 3.88%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 3.88%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 3.88%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 3.88%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 3.88%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 3.88%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 3.88%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000

Healthy daily consolidation so far which is a great setup for follow through, but bulls have disappointed on many occasions the last few weeks.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 3.91%  once again. 

Bitcoin 3.91%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 3.91%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 3.91%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 3.91%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 3.91%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 3.91%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 3.91%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 3.91%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 3.91%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD 3.91%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 3.91%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin 3.91%  core ( BTC 3.91% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity 2.52% .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO -1.90%  Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”   

Philippines’ Economic Zone Creating Crypto Regulations, Licensing 25 Exchanges 
The authority of the Filipino government-owned economic zone is drafting regulations for cryptocurrencies and planning to limit the number of licenses it issues to 25. Other rules include the requirement for each crypto exchange to invest at least US$1 million within 2 years. The authority has reportedly received about 60 applications from crypto companies so far.

Currently  Bitcoin 3.68%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 3.68%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 3.68%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD 3.65%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 3.65%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin 3.65%  core ( BTC 3.65% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity 2.52% .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO -1.90%  Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”   

Philippines’ Economic Zone Creating Crypto Regulations, Licensing 25 Exchanges 
The authority of the Filipino government-owned economic zone is drafting regulations for cryptocurrencies and planning to limit the number of licenses it issues to 25. Other rules include the requirement for each crypto exchange to invest at least US$1 million within 2 years. The authority has reportedly received about 60 applications from crypto companies so far.

 Bitcoin 3.63%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin 3.54%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 3.54% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 3.54%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 3.54%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 3.54%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 3.54%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 3.54%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 3.54%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 3.54%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 3.54%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Trade Alert 

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000 

This is just an idea. 

Never forget your SL !

 Bitcoin 3.53%  in a tightening pattern on the 4 hour which is showing up as a daily  inside bar .  
The break of this range today will dictate momentum for this week as it is time for the bulls to prove follow through or shut up.  
Healthy daily consolidation so far which is a great setup for follow through, but bulls have disappointed on many occasions the last few weeks.  
The current setup will allow for a trade entry on a break in whichever direction, keeping in mind we have been seeing some fake outs.  
Clear higher lows and lower highs to use as stop levels for those wanting to keep a tight leash on the trade.  
Lots of patience waiting for this break, likely sometime within the next 8 hours or so.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 3.53%  once again. 

Bitcoin 3.53%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 3.53%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 3.53%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 3.53%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 3.53%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 3.53%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 3.53%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 3.53%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 3.53%   somewhat clearer.

B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 3.49%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 3.49%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 3.49%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 3.49%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 3.49%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 3.49%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 3.49%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 3.49%  once again. 

Bitcoin 3.49%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 3.49%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 3.49%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 3.49%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 3.49%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 3.49%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 3.49%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 3.49%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 3.49%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD 3.51%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 3.51%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin 3.51%  core ( BTC 3.51% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity 1.07% .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO -1.90%  Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”

 Bitcoin 3.47%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin 3.51%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 3.51% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 3.51%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 3.51%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 3.51%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 3.51%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 3.51%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 3.51%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 3.51%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 3.51%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20.

Currently  Bitcoin              is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin              has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin              seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin              tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin              have seen a great demand bounce.

 Bitcoin 3.66%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin 3.61%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 3.61% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 3.61%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 3.61%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 3.61%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 3.61%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 3.61%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 3.61%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 3.61%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 3.61%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000 

This is just an idea.

Healthy daily consolidation so far which is a great setup for follow through, but bulls have disappointed on many occasions the last few weeks.  
The current setup will allow for a trade entry on a break in whichever direction, keeping in mind we have been seeing some fake outs.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 3.64%  once again. 

Bitcoin 3.64%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 3.64%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 3.64%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 3.64%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 3.64%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 3.64%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 3.64%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 3.64%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 3.64%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD 3.63%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 3.63%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin 3.63%  core ( BTC 3.63% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity             .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO              Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”

So,  bitcoin 3.67%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 3.67% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit).

A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 3.67%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 3.67%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 3.67%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 3.67%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 3.67%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 3.67%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 3.67%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20.

Potential trade is building up, so here is a trade idea. It's up to you to take it, but if you do, then have your SL in place. 

BUY: at ~6500 
TP:  7500 (if the buying momentum is there, then you can try to drive it further, but in this case move SL to 7500 to secure the profit) 
SL:  6000 

This is just an idea. 

Never forget your SL !

The break of this range today will dictate momentum for this week as it is time for the bulls to prove follow through or shut up.  
Healthy daily consolidation so far which is a great setup for follow through, but bulls have disappointed on many occasions the last few weeks.  
The current setup will allow for a trade entry on a break in whichever direction, keeping in mind we have been seeing some fake outs.  
Clear higher lows and lower highs to use as stop levels for those wanting to keep a tight leash on the trade.

Hey, I am back after some time looking at  Bitcoin 3.74%  once again. 

Bitcoin 3.74%  has found good demand in 5800 area, where  Bitcoin 3.74%  has went few days ago from 5755 directly to 6250 (8,5%) in one candle, this time Bitcoin 3.74%  has confirmed this support once again, with even stronger bounce from 5850 right to 6545 (11%) with the help of  Ascending triangle . 

Currently  Bitcoin 3.74%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 3.74%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 3.74%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 3.74%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 3.74%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend. 

Also three waves are enough for the sellers to be satisfied, but yet 4 can come, but not that likely. 

So even overall  MACD  looks good. 

So I think thats about it.. If you have any Questions feel free to ask me down bellow or at my Discord channel!  

Hope I made your view on whats going on with  Bitcoin 3.74%   somewhat clearer.  
If you like this  Technical Analysis  let me know in the comments, Likes are aprreciated, Thanks !  

If I see something worth to share on the chart I will surely do an Update.

Price 
Like was expected, closure of the June  Futures  brought movement to the market and pulled the price above the  Bearish Trend Line , which was a strong resistance to the price recently.  BTCUSD 3.74%  reached 6300.0 level, which was crucial for breaking the downward pattern, but did not go upper and has been trading in an indecisive pattern slightly above it during the weekend. To confirm the further development of the upward movement, we will need to see more volumes above the 6300, which will prove that traders are ready to buy on this price; next resistance on the way up will be 6500 – 6650 zone. Negative scenario is a further movement in the narrow lateral pattern, which will demonstrate low demand on current price and eventually bring  BTC 3.74%  down again; 6000.0 level will play a supportive role I such scenario. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6500.0 zone.  

Latest news 
Red Flag Waved in Tether’s Relationship with Kraken Exchange 
Bloomberg recently suggested tether trading red flags. Enlisting former Fed regulator Mark Williams and NYU’s Rosa Abrantes-Metz, Mr. Leising and his collaborators examined USDT activity on Kraken, finding “oddly specific order sizes—many going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.” Trading bots, if that is what this is, are rather par for the course these days, and hardly controversial. It’s USDT’s lack of responsiveness that has this group searching for explanation.  Bitcoin 3.74%  core ( BTC 3.74% ), again assuming tether  inflation  as the cause, jerks and pulls seemingly according to tether dumps, which most would term “normal.” Tether lingers, unresponsive.   
The theory goes that with increased demand, an asset’s price should correspondingly increase. One trade, of 75 tether, for example, managed to move the price three naughts and a one after a decimal point, basically nothing. And USDT price should’ve gone up at various other stages, along with pumping the gas with still more tether to bring it to settle. That didn’t happen either. Again, what should be a natural search for equalization through supply is instead, seemingly, being controlled by bots. 
Some immediately believe this to be textbook manipulation, but more substantive information is needed before making such an accusation. Still, researchers maintain these kinds of irregularities “would be akin to defying  gravity             .” The manipulation question first came from a renowned poker player, Andrew Rennhack. He scrubbed data from Kraken and published his musings. He was one of the first to openly suggest something was amiss. 
Later, researchers noticed those oddly specific numbers, such as the 13,076.389 tether, lead them to “suspect that such numbers could be signals to cheaters’ automated trading programs. One possible explanation: The software would look for orders with a unique size, and trade against that.” Taking both sides of a coin gives off the impression of a kind of momentum, and government regulators have seen fit to make doing so illegal. No evidence that Kraken itself is involved in any manipulation has emerged. Kraken  CEO              Jesse Powell responded, “Nothing looks out of place to us in our publicly available data feed. We have not verified the legitimacy of the data set  asked us to review.”

 Bitcoin 3.75%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin 3.75%  developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin 3.75% . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin 3.75%  reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin 3.75%  has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin 3.75%  touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 3.75%  returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 3.75%  is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin 3.75%  closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin 3.75%  did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin 3.75%  will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.

Currently  Bitcoin 3.75%  is in a huge falling wedge bullish pattern  which  Bitcoin 3.75%  has already broke through and found a bit of support at this  falling wedge  downtrend line. 

In shorter term,  Bitcoin 3.75%  seems to be in a  Bull flag  with great demand. 

Lets look at Indicators. 

Relative Strenght Index has shown after longer time finnaly break into strong  demand zone  above 60 and have stayed there for a while pretty high, was fighting with 60 level failed few times and had to retest support, which was succesful with a strong bounce, than  Bitcoin 3.75%  tried once again to break this 60 key level but failed so retested support once again, and once again  Bitcoin 3.75%  have seen a great demand bounce.  

So overall  RSI  looks good. 

On Moving Average Convergence Divergence you can see that after this 11% run-up, you always see selling waves come.  

But this time, these waves havent made really any significant movement downwards, which shows good demand in sell trend.

 Bitcoin 3.79%  is currently consolidating on the 1 hour chart underneath a falling  trend line . Normally, I'm not comfortable taking a short position as price can easily break above. However, with Bitcoin's weakness and failure to push into higher highs, shorts are favored. 

We can see a few significant doji's are also starting to form. I love entering trades at the half-way point on the wick and placing stops above/below thh wick. 

If we project a downside target from the consolidation zone, the profit target coincides with a 50%  Fibonacci retracement  at $6,170 level.   

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion, make of it what you wish. It is not financial advice.

					I've taken an aggressive short position at $6,356 with stops above$6,373. This is a small position. High risk but comes with high reward. Safer entry is a break of the lower trend line

been short -6402 since yday, was a lil nervous on that run up to 430 but it held into my sweet spot perfectly so far, sell  volume  is lacking tho and im not extremely comfortable here, long hedge at 6150 on FUTs 

these are also macro trending moves im playing with very tight entries to maximize r/r, im in a comfortable enough position now ill actually move my SL back to allow the trade to run free and re-add in an even higher r:r sceanario like a stop run up to 6450, will add and have SL set to 6490-6.5 instead

We have a  descending triangle  on the daily TF a break out of the counter resistant line would give me interest of seeing whether will price give me a solid retest and also respect the  trend line  as new support...once price rejects i will wait for  bullish  momentum to enter long.

As soon as Friday neared to the end, we immediately saw an example of weekend manipulation. From the TA’s point of view, this jump could be seen already 30 minutes before its beginning, about which I wrote in my brief updates ""... we have a buy signal on 4H TF ... if the bulls successfully support it, it would reach the daily middle bands of the channels (BB, KC , DC) ~6350-6450 ... "" 

So,  bitcoin              developed the run to ~6500, slowing down around 5H SMA100 and 5H EMA91. And if you look at the 5H chart, you would see that the 5H SMA100 still has a downward pressure on  bitcoin             . I estimated that all these jumps are part of a manipulative short position on the weekend, and all this might fall on Monday-Tuesday. With this approach, it was reasonable to open shorts at ~6250 (10% of the deposit) and at ~6400 (20% deposit). SL (as I already mentioned) - above daily EMA26 (daily EMA26 was not tested since 10 May). 

My target has not changed: wait until  bitcoin              reaches 4H and 5H M/BB and M/KC (aka SMA20 and EMA20), and then: 
A) If this support holds the test and shows an upward signal - then close the shorts, go long. 
B) If the support fails the test, then keep the shorts to 4H and 5H lower bands of the channels L/KC ~6100 or L/BB ~5800-5900. 

As you can see,  bitcoin              has already got near to the target, especially at the 4H time frame, touching M/KC (aka EMA20). Moreover, the proposed model based on daily TF – still applies:  bitcoin              touched M/BB and M/KC, whereas daily BB did not expand - so might be it was not a breakthrough, but rather a technical movement (test of middle bands of channels). 

Let us analyze further possible movements: 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              returned down from the upper bands of BB, KC, DC and rushed to the middle bands, where we are expected a break down. This is confirmed by TIs: %R=-63, CCI=29 (negative trend), DMI=24 ( +DI  tends down to  -DI ), MACD=58 ( MACD  < signal line, FT-negative trend and  EMA  (6, 9, 12) began a negative reversal. 

2) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight near M/BB (aka SMA20), but the bulls have not been able to fix the position above the M/KC (aka EMA20) - therefore, it might be followed by a downward turn to the lower bands of channels. TIs produce mixed neutral signals. The positive thing is that  EMA  (6, 9, 12) started an upward reversal. 

3) At the weekly time frame:  Bitcoin              closed the week above EMA91, which also proves my model based on weekly SMA/EMA 91 and 100. TIs shift to the side of the bulls, but this process could stretch over time, and deeper levels might come (EMA100 ~5650, SMA91 ~5100, SMA100 ~4700). In addition,  bitcoin              did not fix above L/KC (20; 1), so we might expect testing L/KC (20; 1.5) ~5700. After that I would like to see a rapid acceleration to M/BB (projection) and M/KC (projection) ~7200-7600. 

4) At the monthly time frame: As expected, the candle went just below EMA20 - but the closing occurred above this MA. I remind you that since 2015 the monthly candle has never closed below EMA20 and below SMA20. Still there is a high probability that  bitcoin              will go below monthly SMA20 ~ 5450 (deep to mentioned above weekly MAs), but the closing should be higher than this monthly SMA20. 

Conclusion and information about opened position - is at the very beginning, so I will not repeat it. 

Good luck.
