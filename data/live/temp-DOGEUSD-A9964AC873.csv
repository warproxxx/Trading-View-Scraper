It's been what, few month now since we heard anything about DOGE? Yeah, sounds about right especially in this downtrending market everyone forgot doggy, but it is due to recover in 2018 according to it's pattern and historical analysis. Don't be spooked by it's supply amount, it's fine, be intrigued by it's transaction cost and total quietness surrounding it.  

When everyone is  bearish , you should be  bullish  and vice versa, but what if there's neither  bullish  nor  bearish  sentiment toward a coin? Well, in that case you go back, look at it's fundamentals, historical analysis,  volume , indicators and any patterns. 

Risk assessment on this trade is medium which indicates that Stop Loss might not hurt in this instance. We recommend going below 15% of your total portfolio into this unless you're just sitting on $1,000 then you can pull it over 50% 

With that said we will keep look on Dogecoin while it is preparing for a possible recovery. 

Oh yeah, and let me not forget to mention that people like cheap coins, they love it when few hundred dollars brings in over 100K coin. Yes, I know some will say that there are many cheaper coins out there and I will agree, however let's not forget that as of today this is a 40 ranked coin in market capture which has been established since 2014 which gives it a lot of solid backup. 

Enjoy this trade, advice my Crypto Maniacs, but remember to invest only what you can afford to lose or you're going right back to poverty on drop. We are not your financial advisors.
