2  Bearish  Close and Reverse Candle Formations with Major Rejection Wicks almost exactly at the same price level on a Friday Night... 

It is very frequent to see the break of a  Rising Wedge  then hook up and even test the line broke down through 
opposite can also be true for a  Falling Wedge 
so it is no surprise to see this hook especially that the  RSI  had dropped quite rapidly on the 1h so maybe needed a little breathing room 


Triple top most likely a sell of incoming. Be careful traders.   

I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement of that  Rising Wedge  move, give ourselves a bit of breathing room on the lower time frame  RSI  and regain a bit of interest on the buy side and then continue our move up since the Daily  RSI  is still progressing slowly higher and nowhere near elevated levels 

I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper.

so it is no surprise to see this hook especially that the  RSI  had dropped quite rapidly on the 1h so maybe needed a little breathing room 


Triple top most likely a sell of incoming. Be careful traders.   

I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement of that  Rising Wedge  move, give ourselves a bit of breathing room on the lower time frame  RSI  and regain a bit of interest on the buy side and then continue our move up since the Daily  RSI  is still progressing slowly higher and nowhere near elevated levels 

I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper.

opposite can also be true for a  Falling Wedge 
so it is no surprise to see this hook especially that the  RSI  had dropped quite rapidly on the 1h so maybe needed a little breathing room 


Triple top most likely a sell of incoming. Be careful traders.   

I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement of that  Rising Wedge  move, give ourselves a bit of breathing room on the lower time frame  RSI  and regain a bit of interest on the buy side and then continue our move up since the Daily  RSI  is still progressing slowly higher and nowhere near elevated levels 

I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper.

It is very frequent to see the break of a  Rising Wedge  then hook up and even test the line broke down through 
opposite can also be true for a  Falling Wedge 
so it is no surprise to see this hook especially that the  RSI  had dropped quite rapidly on the 1h so maybe needed a little breathing room 


Triple top most likely a sell of incoming. Be careful traders.   

I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement of that  Rising Wedge  move, give ourselves a bit of breathing room on the lower time frame  RSI  and regain a bit of interest on the buy side and then continue our move up since the Daily  RSI  is still progressing slowly higher and nowhere near elevated levels 

I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper.

Hey guys, 

Previous trade is still in place -  trendline  is adjusted - initial target $7000 - it might go higher, don't forget to ride the wave if it does!

2  Bearish  Close and Reverse Candle Formations with Major Rejection Wicks almost exactly at the same price level on a Friday Night... 

It is very frequent to see the break of a  Rising Wedge  then hook up and even test the line broke down through 
opposite can also be true for a  Falling Wedge 
so it is no surprise to see this hook especially that the  RSI  had dropped quite rapidly on the 1h so maybe needed a little breathing room 


Triple top most likely a sell of incoming. Be careful traders.   

I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement of that  Rising Wedge  move, give ourselves a bit of breathing room on the lower time frame  RSI  and regain a bit of interest on the buy side and then continue our move up since the Daily  RSI  is still progressing slowly higher and nowhere near elevated levels 

I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper.

It is very frequent to see the break of a  Rising Wedge  then hook up and even test the line broke down through 
opposite can also be true for a  Falling Wedge 
so it is no surprise to see this hook especially that the  RSI  had dropped quite rapidly on the 1h so maybe needed a little breathing room 


Triple top most likely a sell of incoming. Be careful traders.   

I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement of that  Rising Wedge  move, give ourselves a bit of breathing room on the lower time frame  RSI  and regain a bit of interest on the buy side and then continue our move up since the Daily  RSI  is still progressing slowly higher and nowhere near elevated levels 

I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper.

It is very frequent to see the break of a  Rising Wedge  then hook up and even test the line broke down through 
opposite can also be true for a  Falling Wedge 
so it is no surprise to see this hook especially that the  RSI  had dropped quite rapidly on the 1h so maybe needed a little breathing room 


Triple top most likely a sell of incoming. Be careful traders.   

I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement of that  Rising Wedge  move, give ourselves a bit of breathing room on the lower time frame  RSI  and regain a bit of interest on the buy side and then continue our move up since the Daily  RSI  is still progressing slowly higher and nowhere near elevated levels 

I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper.

It is very frequent to see the break of a  Rising Wedge  then hook up and even test the line broke down through 
opposite can also be true for a  Falling Wedge 
so it is no surprise to see this hook especially that the  RSI  had dropped quite rapidly on the 1h so maybe needed a little breathing room 


Triple top most likely a sell of incoming. Be careful traders.   

I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement of that  Rising Wedge  move, give ourselves a bit of breathing room on the lower time frame  RSI  and regain a bit of interest on the buy side and then continue our move up since the Daily  RSI  is still progressing slowly higher and nowhere near elevated levels 

I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper.

I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement of that  Rising Wedge  move, give ourselves a bit of breathing room on the lower time frame  RSI  and regain a bit of interest on the buy side and then continue our move up since the Daily  RSI  is still progressing slowly higher and nowhere near elevated levels

Temporary growth was done according to the previous analysis. As soon as I see a permanent change, I will share it. But I emphasize that the trend continues to decline until signs of climb are observed.

 Bullish pattern  last days indicates a move to 7000 coming days. 
But IF 20 MA is broken on the downside then we will see 4900 coming weeks. There is a HUGH support that will lead to a monstrous move to the upside.

Hey guys, 

Previous trade is still in place -  trendline  is adjusted - initial target $7000 - it might go higher, don't forget to ride the wave if it does!

2  Bearish  Close and Reverse Candle Formations with Major Rejection Wicks almost exactly at the same price level on a Friday Night... 

It is very frequent to see the break of a  Rising Wedge  then hook up and even test the line broke down through 
opposite can also be true for a  Falling Wedge 
so it is no surprise to see this hook especially that the  RSI  had dropped quite rapidly on the 1h so maybe needed a little breathing room 


Triple top most likely a sell of incoming. Be careful traders.   

I would say it would be very possible to see a pullback and break down through the  Rising Wedge  to a 50-61.8 Fib Retracement of that  Rising Wedge  move, give ourselves a bit of breathing room on the lower time frame  RSI  and regain a bit of interest on the buy side and then continue our move up since the Daily  RSI  is still progressing slowly higher and nowhere near elevated levels 

I would be looking for the first pull back to around $6,400 and then 6,270 before confirming anything deeper.
