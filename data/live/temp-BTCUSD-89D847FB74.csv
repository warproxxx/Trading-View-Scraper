 BTC              Dojis are lining up indicating a large move to 6800 or 5900 could play out. 
As these are on the 12 hour candle , it needs time to play out.

Since  Bitcoin              has been on the market from Coinbase in 2015 it has not yet broken its continued  trend line . For that the uptrend continues to advance showing here on a weekly chart no sign of decline in the future. This is but a small pullback and whats crazy is that  Bitcoin              still holds its somewhat strong value even though China has stopped all trading platforms from trading  Bitcoin              until its regulated. When the regulation hits sometime this year is when  Bitcoin              will continue its uptrend.  Bitcoin              is so strong that it doesn't even have a actual strong support or resistance to project price action which makes it super hard to read.
