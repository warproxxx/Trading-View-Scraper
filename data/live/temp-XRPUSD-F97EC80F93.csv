Ripple looks less promising than other majors as the crypto failed to establish new highs during the weekend. The currency pair has lost more than two percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair has broken through the ascending  trend line  and moved lower. It is hard to say currently whether Ripple is going to resume its uptrend in the nearest future. 

The situation on the 4H chart is neutral as there is no tendency currently. Ripple failed to jump over the  resistance area  at $0.5088 during the weekend. The currency pair tested the  support area  at $0.4744 instead. 
We have set upper targets for Ripple at $0.5444, but currently we cannot say that XRP/USD is able to reach them in the nearest future as the uptrend was broken. The lower targets are set at the  support area  at $0.4495, but Ripple will have to breakout the closest  support area  at $0.4744 in order to reach it.
