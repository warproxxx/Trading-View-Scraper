1530424321.0,Slyx737,ETH - Price Analysis,"
There's a wonderful  inverse head and shoulders  currently taking shape on the  daily chart . IH&S patterns are trend reversal, breakout patterns.  

If the price runs up the right shoulder, consolidates, and breaks above the neckline on the other side. That would be taken as a confirmation of trend reversal. 

However, one should keep in mind that this is a long forecast and would not be confirmed until 7/19.  

Tenkan/Kijun are both ranging meaning less volatility/momentum.  

My  TRIX  is smoothed out to have very accurate buy signals. We currently see a bull cross taking place for a buy which further confirms this chart pattern.  

Stochastic RSI  would need to continue it's rise, test the resistance at ~80 before bouncing off support at 34.
