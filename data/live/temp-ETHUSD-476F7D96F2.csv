2 hours ago




Hello crypto traders,  

I update my chart for  BITFINEX:ETHUSD -0.20%  as i was missing an entire  elliot wave  cycle i did not spot earlier. Now its fine.  

I am expecting one more dump to the inferior triangle line acting as support. I am currently out as i sold the top of the triangle and looking for an entry around 460, then i will wait for the pump to happen.  

Remember to set your stops, this is crypto.  

Have a nice weekend.  

Roberto

1530950597.0,bibboyne,Bullish Breakout Awaits for Ethereum (ETH/USD Analysis) - Update,"
Good day, my friends!  This is an updated chart for my previous analysis titled “Ethereum –  Falling Wedge  Reversal” dated July 4 (three days ago) which remains “valid” until today.  This new chart, however, should give you a clearer view of how price is going to hit our target. 

Now let’s take a closer look at the short term setup in the the 3-hour chart.  There have been some positive developments on the  Ethereum              (ETH) trend recently so let us go through every one of them. 

1.  The purple lines outline the  Falling Wedge  that price has been trying to breakout from. This is a  bullish  sign. 

2.  The  bullish  symmetrical triangle as outlined by the green lines are still intact and valid. This is another  bullish  sign. 

3.  Several breakout attempts below the triangle were quickly reversed. This shows that we have more ready buyers to get aboard the moon ride than sellers (mostly weak hands). Yet another  bullish  sign. 

4.  What was previously a  Rising Wedge  ( bearish pattern ) has now turned into a  Bullish Channel  as outlined by the tangerine lines. This is the best  bullish  sign because we can now clearly see how price has a good chance to hit our target range as highlighted by the red box. 

Keep in mind that those who trade with patience and consistency are often rewarded.  What we want is to look for profitable trades (like this one, for example) regardless of how long it takes to reach our goal.  After all, trading is meant to be boring so a piece of advice - please avoid scalping (day trading) unless you are a very good trader.  Even so, no trader is “that” good to be right all the time.

Happy trading, my friends!  :)

The  Ethereum              rate is still in the lateral movement. 
Priority of the day: a decrease in the rate of  ETHUSD              to $ 410. 
We stick to our vision of continuing the fall of  Ethereum              to the nearest low. It is not excluded that near the zone: $ 410 - $ 400, buyers can take the initiative in their hands. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD              rate will drop from $ 480 to $ 410. 
2. The  ETHUSD              rate may continue its lateral movement for another day. 
Alternative scenario: 
The rate of  Ethereum              can exit flat upwards, to $ 500. 
Naturally, then we will incur losses on  Ethereum              short position.
