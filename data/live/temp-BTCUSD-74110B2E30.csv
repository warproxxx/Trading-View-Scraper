1530706668.0,DestinationMoonCrypto,Bitcoin Today: Syscoin madness on Binance,"
Price 
As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 0.62%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.   

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6600.0 zone.

Syscoin Hack Disrupts Binance Prompting Temporary Shutdown 
Syscoin has been hit by an unusual hack that has manipulated the coin’s total supply. The attackers then sent the fraudulently generated coins to Binance and sold them, pushing the price of 1  SYS 1.25%  to as high as 96  BTC 0.62% . The  BTC 0.62%  they received was then withdrawn, prompting Binance to temporarily cease trading and to reset all APIs, which are believed to have facilitated the attack. 
India  Bitcoin 0.62%  Bank Ban in Effect July 5 After Supreme Court Decision 
India’s Supreme Court has refused to extend a grace period allowing cryptocurrency entities to keep banking services beyond this week’s deadline set by the  central bank . 
According to various media outlets, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now succeed in implementing its ban on cryptocurrency business support on July 5. 
Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses. 
Local industry players had widely anticipated the deadline coming into effect, warning customers in advance of the potential for funds to remain in cryptocurrency.

an hour ago




According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 0.62%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 0.62% . 

You can find many of my latest trades by checking the ""Related ideas"" below this post.

Thanks a lot for reading this report. I will be sharing more, and you can also read those...

If we have a drop that is strong enough to change the signals that I am getting from the charts, then I will publish an update and let you know about it. In the meantime, we are bullish in the short term.

 Bitcoin 0.63%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

Dear HodlCrypots,  

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 0.63%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.  

It's a combination of graph channels,  elliot wave  and fib relations.

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin 0.63%  slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin 0.63%  might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin 0.63%  turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 0.63%  is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin 0.63%  did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 0.63%  is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 0.63%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 0.63%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 0.63%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 0.63%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 1.80%  and  ZRXUSD 7.07%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

The 50  RSI  has not been pierced through.  Notice how every piercing marked the establishment of a trend reversal. The day candles are currently being supported by the 20EMA (yellow), which has not happened since the current down trend began. The trend looks to be weakening.

On the contrary,  bearish  swings in intermediate trend are in tandem with momentum and trend indicators (refer weekly plotting). No traces of recovery, bears are on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017. 

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

Looks like were well back on track, might be delayed by a couple days.

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval.

Price 
As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 0.62%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.   

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6600.0 zone.

India  Bitcoin 0.62%  Bank Ban in Effect July 5 After Supreme Court Decision 
India’s Supreme Court has refused to extend a grace period allowing cryptocurrency entities to keep banking services beyond this week’s deadline set by the  central bank . 
According to various media outlets, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now succeed in implementing its ban on cryptocurrency business support on July 5. 
Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses. 
Local industry players had widely anticipated the deadline coming into effect, warning customers in advance of the potential for funds to remain in cryptocurrency.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN              WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin             .

 Bitcoin 0.62%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

Dear HodlCrypots,  

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 0.62%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin 0.62%  slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin 0.62%  might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin 0.62%  turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 0.62%  is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin 0.62%  did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 0.62%  is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 0.63%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 0.63%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

1530701852.0,TheTradersCorner,I'm back! BTCUSD: is it over? ,"
Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD              (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD              and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD              and  ZRXUSD              within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD              (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD              and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD              and  ZRXUSD              within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

On the contrary,  bearish  swings in intermediate trend are in tandem with momentum and trend indicators (refer weekly plotting). No traces of recovery, bears are on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017. 

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

Price 
As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 0.63%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.   

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6600.0 zone.

According to various media outlets, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now succeed in implementing its ban on cryptocurrency business support on July 5. 
Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 0.63%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 0.63% .

 Bitcoin 0.62%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

Dear HodlCrypots,  

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 0.62%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.  

It's a combination of graph channels,  elliot wave  and fib relations.

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin 0.62%  slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin 0.62%  might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin 0.62%  turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 0.62%  is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin 0.62%  did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 0.62%  is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 0.62%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 0.62%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view.

The ( III             ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III             ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.  

It's a combination of graph channels,  elliot wave  and fib relations.

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin              slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin              might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin              turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin              did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC              to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC              is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 0.63%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 0.63%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 2.00%  and  ZRXUSD 6.51%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

The 50  RSI  has not been pierced through.  Notice how every piercing marked the establishment of a trend reversal. The day candles are currently being supported by the 20EMA (yellow), which has not happened since the current down trend began. The trend looks to be weakening.

On the contrary,  bearish  swings in intermediate trend are in tandem with momentum and trend indicators (refer weekly plotting). No traces of recovery, bears are on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017. 

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

Price 
As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 0.63%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.

Trading in the 6300.0 – 6600.0 zone.

Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 0.63%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 0.63% . 

You can find many of my latest trades by checking the ""Related ideas"" below this post.

Your support is highly appreciated.

Thanks a lot for reading this report. I will be sharing more, and you can also read those...

					Note: Short price drops are irrelevant to the above analysis unless we close below $6,300 on the daily time frame. 

If we have a drop that is strong enough to change the signals that I am getting from the charts, then I will publish an update and let you know about it. In the meantime, we are bullish in the short term.

 Bitcoin 0.63%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

According to various media outlets, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now succeed in implementing its ban on cryptocurrency business support on July 5. 
Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses. 
Local industry players had widely anticipated the deadline coming into effect, warning customers in advance of the potential for funds to remain in cryptocurrency.

an hour ago




According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 0.66%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 0.66% . 

You can find many of my latest trades by checking the ""Related ideas"" below this post.

Your support is highly appreciated.

Thanks a lot for reading this report. I will be sharing more, and you can also read those...

					Note: Short price drops are irrelevant to the above analysis unless we close below $6,300 on the daily time frame. 

If we have a drop that is strong enough to change the signals that I am getting from the charts, then I will publish an update and let you know about it. In the meantime, we are bullish in the short term.

 Bitcoin 0.66%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

Dear HodlCrypots,  

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 0.66%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.  

It's a combination of graph channels,  elliot wave  and fib relations.

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin              slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin              might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin              turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin              did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC              to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC              is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD              (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD              and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD              and  ZRXUSD              within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

On the contrary,  bearish  swings in intermediate trend are in tandem with momentum and trend indicators (refer weekly plotting). No traces of recovery, bears are on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017. 

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

Price 
As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 0.66%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.   

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6600.0 zone.

Syscoin Hack Disrupts Binance Prompting Temporary Shutdown

The attackers then sent the fraudulently generated coins to Binance and sold them, pushing the price of 1  SYS 1.25%  to as high as 96  BTC 0.66% . The  BTC 0.66%  they received was then withdrawn, prompting Binance to temporarily cease trading and to reset all APIs, which are believed to have facilitated the attack. 
India  Bitcoin 0.66%  Bank Ban in Effect July 5 After Supreme Court Decision 
India’s Supreme Court has refused to extend a grace period allowing cryptocurrency entities to keep banking services beyond this week’s deadline set by the  central bank . 
According to various media outlets, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now succeed in implementing its ban on cryptocurrency business support on July 5. 
Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses. 
Local industry players had widely anticipated the deadline coming into effect, warning customers in advance of the potential for funds to remain in cryptocurrency.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 0.66%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 0.66% .

 Bitcoin 0.66%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

Dear HodlCrypots,  

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 0.66%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.  

It's a combination of graph channels,  elliot wave  and fib relations.

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin 0.66%  slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin 0.66%  might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin 0.66%  turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 0.66%  is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin 0.66%  did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 0.66%  is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 0.66%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 0.66%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

1530701852.0,TheTradersCorner,I'm back! BTCUSD: is it over? ,"
Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 0.66%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 0.66%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 2.14%  and  ZRXUSD 6.51%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 0.66%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 2.24%  and  ZRXUSD 6.51%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

The 50  RSI  has not been pierced through.  Notice how every piercing marked the establishment of a trend reversal. The day candles are currently being supported by the 20EMA (yellow), which has not happened since the current down trend began. The trend looks to be weakening.

On the contrary,  bearish  swings in intermediate trend are in tandem with momentum and trend indicators (refer weekly plotting). No traces of recovery, bears are on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017. 

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

Price 
As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 0.66%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.   

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6600.0 zone.

The attackers then sent the fraudulently generated coins to Binance and sold them, pushing the price of 1  SYS 1.25%  to as high as 96  BTC 0.66% . The  BTC 0.66%  they received was then withdrawn, prompting Binance to temporarily cease trading and to reset all APIs, which are believed to have facilitated the attack.

India’s Supreme Court has refused to extend a grace period allowing cryptocurrency entities to keep banking services beyond this week’s deadline set by the  central bank . 
According to various media outlets, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now succeed in implementing its ban on cryptocurrency business support on July 5. 
Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses. 
Local industry players had widely anticipated the deadline coming into effect, warning customers in advance of the potential for funds to remain in cryptocurrency.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 0.66%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 0.66% .

 Bitcoin              has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 0.66%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin              slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin              might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin              turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin              did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC              to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC              is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin 0.66%  might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin 0.66%  turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 0.66%  is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin 0.66%  did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 0.66%  is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 0.66%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 0.66%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 0.66%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 0.66%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 2.14%  and  ZRXUSD 6.47%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

The 50  RSI  has not been pierced through.  Notice how every piercing marked the establishment of a trend reversal. The day candles are currently being supported by the 20EMA (yellow), which has not happened since the current down trend began. The trend looks to be weakening.

On the contrary,  bearish  swings in intermediate trend are in tandem with momentum and trend indicators (refer weekly plotting). No traces of recovery, bears are on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017. 

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

Price 
As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 0.66%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.

Trading in the 6300.0 – 6600.0 zone.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 0.66%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 0.66% .

					Note: Short price drops are irrelevant to the above analysis unless we close below $6,300 on the daily time frame. 

If we have a drop that is strong enough to change the signals that I am getting from the charts, then I will publish an update and let you know about it. In the meantime, we are bullish in the short term.

 Bitcoin 0.66%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.  

It's a combination of graph channels,  elliot wave  and fib relations.

					Note: Short price drops are irrelevant to the above analysis unless we close below $6,300 on the daily time frame. 

If we have a drop that is strong enough to change the signals that I am getting from the charts, then I will publish an update and let you know about it. In the meantime, we are bullish in the short term.

 Bitcoin 0.69%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

Dear HodlCrypots,  

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 0.72%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.  

It's a combination of graph channels,  elliot wave  and fib relations.

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin 0.72%  slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin 0.72%  might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin 0.72%  turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 0.72%  is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin 0.72%  did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 0.72%  is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 0.72%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 0.72%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 0.72%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 0.72%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 2.31%  and  ZRXUSD 6.47%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

On the contrary,  bearish  swings in intermediate trend are in tandem with momentum and trend indicators (refer weekly plotting). No traces of recovery, bears are on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017. 

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 0.76%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 0.76%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts.

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

Price 
As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 1.40%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.   

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6600.0 zone.

Syscoin Hack Disrupts Binance Prompting Temporary Shutdown 
Syscoin has been hit by an unusual hack that has manipulated the coin’s total supply. The attackers then sent the fraudulently generated coins to Binance and sold them, pushing the price of 1  SYS 1.25%  to as high as 96  BTC 1.40% . The  BTC 1.40%  they received was then withdrawn, prompting Binance to temporarily cease trading and to reset all APIs, which are believed to have facilitated the attack. 
India  Bitcoin 1.40%  Bank Ban in Effect July 5 After Supreme Court Decision 
India’s Supreme Court has refused to extend a grace period allowing cryptocurrency entities to keep banking services beyond this week’s deadline set by the  central bank . 
According to various media outlets, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now succeed in implementing its ban on cryptocurrency business support on July 5. 
Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses. 
Local industry players had widely anticipated the deadline coming into effect, warning customers in advance of the potential for funds to remain in cryptocurrency.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 1.60%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 1.60% . 

You can find many of my latest trades by checking the ""Related ideas"" below this post.

 Bitcoin 1.74%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

Dear HodlCrypots,  

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 1.73%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.  

It's a combination of graph channels,  elliot wave  and fib relations.

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin 1.81%  slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin 1.81%  might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin 1.81%  turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 1.81%  is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin 1.81%  did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 1.81%  is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 1.91%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 1.91%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 1.98%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 1.98%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 3.00%  and  ZRXUSD 7.77%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 2.97%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.   

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6600.0 zone.

India  Bitcoin 2.97%  Bank Ban in Effect July 5 After Supreme Court Decision 
India’s Supreme Court has refused to extend a grace period allowing cryptocurrency entities to keep banking services beyond this week’s deadline set by the  central bank . 
According to various media outlets, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now succeed in implementing its ban on cryptocurrency business support on July 5. 
Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses. 
Local industry players had widely anticipated the deadline coming into effect, warning customers in advance of the potential for funds to remain in cryptocurrency.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 3.10%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 3.10% .

 Bitcoin 3.16%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 3.24%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin              slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin              might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin              turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin              did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC              to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC              is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 3.37%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 3.37%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 3.85%  and  ZRXUSD 8.43%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin 3.84%  did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 3.84%  is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 3.84%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 3.84%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 3.84%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 3.84%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 4.11%  and  ZRXUSD 8.85%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

On the contrary,  bearish  swings in intermediate trend are in tandem with momentum and trend indicators (refer weekly plotting). No traces of recovery, bears are on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017. 

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

Price 
As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 3.93%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.   

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6600.0 zone.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 3.98%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 3.98% .

 Bitcoin 4.09%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 4.11%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.  

It's a combination of graph channels,  elliot wave  and fib relations.

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin              slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin              might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin              turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin              did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.

 Bitcoin 4.19%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started.

Dear HodlCrypots,  

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 4.22%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.  

It's a combination of graph channels,  elliot wave  and fib relations.

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin 4.24%  slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin 4.24%  might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin 4.24%  turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 4.24%  is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin 4.24%  did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 4.24%  is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 4.24%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 4.24%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 4.23%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 4.23%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 4.27%  and  ZRXUSD 10.17%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

On the contrary,  bearish  swings in intermediate trend are in tandem with momentum and trend indicators (refer weekly plotting). No traces of recovery, bears are on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017. 

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 4.07%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 4.00%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 4.00% . 

You can find many of my latest trades by checking the ""Related ideas"" below this post.

Your support is highly appreciated.

Price 
As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 3.70%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.   

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6600.0 zone.

Syscoin Hack Disrupts Binance Prompting Temporary Shutdown 
Syscoin has been hit by an unusual hack that has manipulated the coin’s total supply. The attackers then sent the fraudulently generated coins to Binance and sold them, pushing the price of 1  SYS 1.25%  to as high as 96  BTC 3.70% . The  BTC 3.70%  they received was then withdrawn, prompting Binance to temporarily cease trading and to reset all APIs, which are believed to have facilitated the attack. 
India  Bitcoin 3.70%  Bank Ban in Effect July 5 After Supreme Court Decision 
India’s Supreme Court has refused to extend a grace period allowing cryptocurrency entities to keep banking services beyond this week’s deadline set by the  central bank . 
According to various media outlets, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now succeed in implementing its ban on cryptocurrency business support on July 5. 
Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses. 
Local industry players had widely anticipated the deadline coming into effect, warning customers in advance of the potential for funds to remain in cryptocurrency.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 3.66%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 3.66% . 

You can find many of my latest trades by checking the ""Related ideas"" below this post.

 Bitcoin 3.58%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

Dear HodlCrypots,  

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 3.57%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.  

It's a combination of graph channels,  elliot wave  and fib relations.

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin 3.58%  slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin 3.58%  might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin 3.58%  turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 3.58%  is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin 3.58%  did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 3.58%  is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 3.58%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 3.58%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 3.58%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 3.58%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 3.60%  and  ZRXUSD 10.25%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

The 50  RSI  has not been pierced through.  Notice how every piercing marked the establishment of a trend reversal. The day candles are currently being supported by the 20EMA (yellow), which has not happened since the current down trend began. The trend looks to be weakening.  However, the bulls seem to be facing resistance, with people in the cryptosphere calling lower lows.

On the contrary,  bearish  swings in intermediate trend are in tandem with momentum and trend indicators (refer weekly plotting). No traces of recovery, bears are on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017. 

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval.

As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 3.43%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.

India  Bitcoin 3.43%  Bank Ban in Effect July 5 After Supreme Court Decision 
India’s Supreme Court has refused to extend a grace period allowing cryptocurrency entities to keep banking services beyond this week’s deadline set by the  central bank . 
According to various media outlets, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now succeed in implementing its ban on cryptocurrency business support on July 5. 
Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses. 
Local industry players had widely anticipated the deadline coming into effect, warning customers in advance of the potential for funds to remain in cryptocurrency.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 3.46%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 3.46% .

 Bitcoin 3.52%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

Dear HodlCrypots,  

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 3.52%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin 3.52%  slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin 3.52%  might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin 3.52%  turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 3.52%  is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin 3.52%  did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 3.52%  is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 3.52%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 3.52%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

1530701852.0,TheTradersCorner,I'm back! BTCUSD: is it over? ,"
Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 3.53%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 3.53%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 3.35%  and  ZRXUSD 10.71%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 3.68%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 3.68%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 3.65%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 3.65%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 3.59%  and  ZRXUSD 10.87%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

The 50  RSI  has not been pierced through.  Notice how every piercing marked the establishment of a trend reversal. The day candles are currently being supported by the 20EMA (yellow), which has not happened since the current down trend began. The trend looks to be weakening.

On the contrary,  bearish  swings in intermediate trend are in tandem with momentum and trend indicators (refer weekly plotting). No traces of recovery, bears are on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017. 

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 3.63%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.

Trading in the 6300.0 – 6600.0 zone.

According to various media outlets, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now succeed in implementing its ban on cryptocurrency business support on July 5. 
Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 3.63%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts.

 Bitcoin 3.63%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 3.63%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.  

It's a combination of graph channels,  elliot wave  and fib relations.

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin 3.63%  slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin 3.63%  might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin 3.63%  turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 3.63%  is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin 3.63%  did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 3.63%  is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

 Bitcoin 3.60%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

Dear HodlCrypots,  

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 3.59%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.  

It's a combination of graph channels,  elliot wave  and fib relations.

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin              slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin              might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin              turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin              did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 3.58%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 3.58%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 3.56%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 3.56%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 3.68%  and  ZRXUSD 11.25%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

On the contrary,  bearish  swings in intermediate trend are in tandem with momentum and trend indicators (refer weekly plotting). No traces of recovery, bears are on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017. 

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 3.37%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 3.37% .

 Bitcoin 3.37%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices.

Price 
As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 3.37%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.   

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6600.0 zone.

Syscoin Hack Disrupts Binance Prompting Temporary Shutdown 
Syscoin has been hit by an unusual hack that has manipulated the coin’s total supply. The attackers then sent the fraudulently generated coins to Binance and sold them, pushing the price of 1  SYS              to as high as 96  BTC 3.37% . The  BTC 3.37%  they received was then withdrawn, prompting Binance to temporarily cease trading and to reset all APIs, which are believed to have facilitated the attack. 
India  Bitcoin 3.37%  Bank Ban in Effect July 5 After Supreme Court Decision 
India’s Supreme Court has refused to extend a grace period allowing cryptocurrency entities to keep banking services beyond this week’s deadline set by the  central bank . 
According to various media outlets, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now succeed in implementing its ban on cryptocurrency business support on July 5. 
Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses. 
Local industry players had widely anticipated the deadline coming into effect, warning customers in advance of the potential for funds to remain in cryptocurrency.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 3.37%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 3.37% .

 Bitcoin              has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

Dear HodlCrypots,  

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 3.37%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III             ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III             ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin              slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin              might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin              turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin              did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC              to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC              is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 3.37%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 3.37%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 3.32%  and  ZRXUSD              within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

The 50  RSI  has not been pierced through.  Notice how every piercing marked the establishment of a trend reversal. The day candles are currently being supported by the 20EMA (yellow), which has not happened since the current down trend began. The trend looks to be weakening.

On the contrary,  bearish  swings in intermediate trend are in tandem with momentum and trend indicators (refer weekly plotting). No traces of recovery, bears are on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017. 

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

The 50  RSI  has not been pierced through.  Notice how every piercing marked the establishment of a trend reversal. The day candles are currently being supported by the 20EMA (yellow), which has not happened since the current down trend began. The trend looks to be weakening.  However, the bulls seem to be facing resistance, with people in the cryptosphere calling lower lows.

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

Price 
As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 3.35%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.   

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6600.0 zone.

India  Bitcoin 3.35%  Bank Ban in Effect July 5 After Supreme Court Decision 
India’s Supreme Court has refused to extend a grace period allowing cryptocurrency entities to keep banking services beyond this week’s deadline set by the  central bank . 
According to various media outlets, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now succeed in implementing its ban on cryptocurrency business support on July 5. 
Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses. 
Local industry players had widely anticipated the deadline coming into effect, warning customers in advance of the potential for funds to remain in cryptocurrency.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 3.34%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 3.34% .

 Bitcoin 3.32%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 3.28%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin 3.26%  slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin 3.26%  might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin 3.26%  turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 3.26%  is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin 3.26%  did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 3.26%  is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 3.26%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 3.26%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 3.26%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 3.26%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 3.27%  and  ZRXUSD              within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin 3.37%  did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 3.37%  is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 3.37%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 3.37%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 3.37%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 3.37%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 3.48%  and  ZRXUSD 9.22%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

The 50  RSI  has not been pierced through.  Notice how every piercing marked the establishment of a trend reversal. The day candles are currently being supported by the 20EMA (yellow), which has not happened since the current down trend began. The trend looks to be weakening.

On the contrary,  bearish  swings in intermediate trend are in tandem with momentum and trend indicators (refer weekly plotting). No traces of recovery, bears are on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017. 

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 3.65%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 3.65%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 3.65% .

 Bitcoin 3.65%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin              slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin              might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin              turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin              did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 3.65%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 3.65%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 3.85%  and  ZRXUSD 9.22%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

 Bitcoin 3.55%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

Dear HodlCrypots,  

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 3.55%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.  

It's a combination of graph channels,  elliot wave  and fib relations.

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin              slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin              might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin              turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin              did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC              to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC              is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD              (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD              and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD              and  ZRXUSD              within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

The 50  RSI  has not been pierced through.  Notice how every piercing marked the establishment of a trend reversal. The day candles are currently being supported by the 20EMA (yellow), which has not happened since the current down trend began. The trend looks to be weakening.  However, the bulls seem to be facing resistance, with people in the cryptosphere calling lower lows.

On the contrary,  bearish  swings in intermediate trend are in tandem with momentum and trend indicators (refer weekly plotting). No traces of recovery, bears are on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017. 

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 3.55%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 3.55%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts.

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

Price 
As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 3.55%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.   

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6600.0 zone.

India  Bitcoin 3.55%  Bank Ban in Effect July 5 After Supreme Court Decision 
India’s Supreme Court has refused to extend a grace period allowing cryptocurrency entities to keep banking services beyond this week’s deadline set by the  central bank . 
According to various media outlets, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now succeed in implementing its ban on cryptocurrency business support on July 5. 
Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses. 
Local industry players had widely anticipated the deadline coming into effect, warning customers in advance of the potential for funds to remain in cryptocurrency.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 3.55%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 3.55% .

 Bitcoin 3.55%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin              slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin              might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin              turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin              did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 3.55%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 3.55%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 3.55%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 3.55%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 3.68%  and  ZRXUSD 9.22%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 3.40%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 3.66%  and  ZRXUSD              within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

The 50  RSI  has not been pierced through.  Notice how every piercing marked the establishment of a trend reversal. The day candles are currently being supported by the 20EMA (yellow), which has not happened since the current down trend began. The trend looks to be weakening.

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 3.36%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.

According to various media outlets, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now succeed in implementing its ban on cryptocurrency business support on July 5. 
Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses. 
Local industry players had widely anticipated the deadline coming into effect, warning customers in advance of the potential for funds to remain in cryptocurrency.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 3.30%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 3.30% .

 Bitcoin 3.30%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

Dear HodlCrypots,  

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 3.30%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin 3.30%  slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin 3.30%  might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin 3.30%  turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 3.30%  is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin 3.30%  did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 3.30%  is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 3.30%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 3.30%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 3.29%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 3.29%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 3.42%  and  ZRXUSD              within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin 3.35%  slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin 3.35%  might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin 3.35%  turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 3.35%  is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin 3.35%  did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 3.35%  is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 3.36%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 3.36%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 3.36%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 3.36%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 3.43%  and  ZRXUSD 9.22%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

The 50  RSI  has not been pierced through.  Notice how every piercing marked the establishment of a trend reversal. The day candles are currently being supported by the 20EMA (yellow), which has not happened since the current down trend began. The trend looks to be weakening.  However, the bulls seem to be facing resistance, with people in the cryptosphere calling lower lows.

 BTCUSD 3.40%  forms ‘Gravestone  doji  and  Shooting star  patterns at $6,625.9 and $6,644.9 levels respectively that plummet prices, whereas  hammer  pattern occurs at $6,468.6 levels to counter back these slumps, Current prices remain well below 7 & 9-DMAs despite ongoing upswings (refer 4H charts). 

On the contrary,  bearish  swings in intermediate trend are in tandem with momentum and trend indicators (refer weekly plotting). No traces of recovery, bears are on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017. 

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

Price 
As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 3.40%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.

According to various media outlets, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now succeed in implementing its ban on cryptocurrency business support on July 5. 
Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 3.40%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 3.40% .

					Note: Short price drops are irrelevant to the above analysis unless we close below $6,300 on the daily time frame. 

If we have a drop that is strong enough to change the signals that I am getting from the charts, then I will publish an update and let you know about it. In the meantime, we are bullish in the short term.

 Bitcoin 3.40%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 3.40%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.  

It's a combination of graph channels,  elliot wave  and fib relations.

an hour ago




According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 3.40%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 3.40% . 

You can find many of my latest trades by checking the ""Related ideas"" below this post.

Your support is highly appreciated. 
Your time as well. 

Thanks a lot for reading this report. I will be sharing more, and you can also read those...

					Note: Short price drops are irrelevant to the above analysis unless we close below $6,300 on the daily time frame. 

If we have a drop that is strong enough to change the signals that I am getting from the charts, then I will publish an update and let you know about it. In the meantime, we are bullish in the short term.

 Bitcoin 3.40%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

Dear HodlCrypots,  

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 3.40%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.  

It's a combination of graph channels,  elliot wave  and fib relations.

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin 3.40%  slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin 3.40%  might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin 3.40%  turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 3.40%  is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin 3.40%  did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 3.40%  is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 3.40%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 3.40%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 3.40%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 3.40%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 3.65%  and  ZRXUSD 9.22%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

The 50  RSI  has not been pierced through.  Notice how every piercing marked the establishment of a trend reversal. The day candles are currently being supported by the 20EMA (yellow), which has not happened since the current down trend began. The trend looks to be weakening.  However, the bulls seem to be facing resistance, with people in the cryptosphere calling lower lows.

On the contrary,  bearish  swings in intermediate trend are in tandem with momentum and trend indicators (refer weekly plotting). No traces of recovery, bears are on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017. 

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 3.40%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

Price 
As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 3.35%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.   

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6600.0 zone.

India  Bitcoin 3.35%  Bank Ban in Effect July 5 After Supreme Court Decision 
India’s Supreme Court has refused to extend a grace period allowing cryptocurrency entities to keep banking services beyond this week’s deadline set by the  central bank . 
According to various media outlets, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now succeed in implementing its ban on cryptocurrency business support on July 5. 
Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses. 
Local industry players had widely anticipated the deadline coming into effect, warning customers in advance of the potential for funds to remain in cryptocurrency.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 3.35%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 3.35% .

 Bitcoin              has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 3.35%  0.18% .

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin              slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin              might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin              turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin              did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 3.35%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 3.35%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD              (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD              and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD              and  ZRXUSD              within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 3.44%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 3.44%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 3.56%  and  ZRXUSD              within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

The 50  RSI  has not been pierced through.  Notice how every piercing marked the establishment of a trend reversal. The day candles are currently being supported by the 20EMA (yellow), which has not happened since the current down trend began. The trend looks to be weakening.

On the contrary,  bearish  swings in intermediate trend are in tandem with momentum and trend indicators (refer weekly plotting). No traces of recovery, bears are on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017. 

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

Price 
As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 3.44%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.   

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6600.0 zone.

According to various media outlets, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now succeed in implementing its ban on cryptocurrency business support on July 5. 
Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses. 
Local industry players had widely anticipated the deadline coming into effect, warning customers in advance of the potential for funds to remain in cryptocurrency.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 3.44%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 3.44% .

 Bitcoin 3.44%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

Dear HodlCrypots,  

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 3.44%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.  

It's a combination of graph channels,  elliot wave  and fib relations.

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin 3.44%  slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin 3.44%  might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin 3.44%  turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 3.44%  is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin 3.44%  did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 3.44%  is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 3.44%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 3.44%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.  

It's a combination of graph channels,  elliot wave  and fib relations.

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin 3.44%  slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin 3.44%  might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin 3.44%  turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 3.44%  is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin 3.44%  did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 3.44%  is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 3.44%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 3.44%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 3.44%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 3.44%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 3.59%  and  ZRXUSD 9.22%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

The 50  RSI  has not been pierced through.  Notice how every piercing marked the establishment of a trend reversal. The day candles are currently being supported by the 20EMA (yellow), which has not happened since the current down trend began. The trend looks to be weakening.  However, the bulls seem to be facing resistance, with people in the cryptosphere calling lower lows.

As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 3.44%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 3.44%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 3.44% .

					Note: Short price drops are irrelevant to the above analysis unless we close below $6,300 on the daily time frame. 

If we have a drop that is strong enough to change the signals that I am getting from the charts, then I will publish an update and let you know about it. In the meantime, we are bullish in the short term.

 Bitcoin 3.44%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

The attackers then sent the fraudulently generated coins to Binance and sold them, pushing the price of 1  SYS 1.25%  to as high as 96  BTC 3.41% . The  BTC 3.41%  they received was then withdrawn, prompting Binance to temporarily cease trading and to reset all APIs, which are believed to have facilitated the attack. 
India  Bitcoin 3.41%  Bank Ban in Effect July 5 After Supreme Court Decision 
India’s Supreme Court has refused to extend a grace period allowing cryptocurrency entities to keep banking services beyond this week’s deadline set by the  central bank . 
According to various media outlets, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now succeed in implementing its ban on cryptocurrency business support on July 5. 
Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses. 
Local industry players had widely anticipated the deadline coming into effect, warning customers in advance of the potential for funds to remain in cryptocurrency.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN              WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin             . 

You can find many of my latest trades by checking the ""Related ideas"" below this post.

Thanks a lot for reading this report. I will be sharing more, and you can also read those...

If we have a drop that is strong enough to change the signals that I am getting from the charts, then I will publish an update and let you know about it. In the meantime, we are bullish in the short term.

 Bitcoin              has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

Dear HodlCrypots,  

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 3.45%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.  

It's a combination of graph channels,  elliot wave  and fib relations.

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin 3.42%  slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin 3.42%  might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin 3.42%  turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 3.42%  is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin 3.42%  did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 3.42%  is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 3.42%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 3.42%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 3.41%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 3.41%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 3.57%  and  ZRXUSD 10.97%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

Looks like were well back on track, might be delayed by a couple days.

The 50  RSI  has not been pierced through.  Notice how every piercing marked the establishment of a trend reversal. The day candles are currently being supported by the 20EMA (yellow), which has not happened since the current down trend began. The trend looks to be weakening.  However, the bulls seem to be facing resistance, with people in the cryptosphere calling lower lows.

On the contrary,  bearish  swings in intermediate trend are in tandem with momentum and trend indicators (refer weekly plotting). No traces of recovery, bears are on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017. 

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 3.32%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.   

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6600.0 zone.

India’s Supreme Court has refused to extend a grace period allowing cryptocurrency entities to keep banking services beyond this week’s deadline set by the  central bank . 
According to various media outlets, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now succeed in implementing its ban on cryptocurrency business support on July 5. 
Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses. 
Local industry players had widely anticipated the deadline coming into effect, warning customers in advance of the potential for funds to remain in cryptocurrency.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 3.32%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 3.32% .

 Bitcoin 3.32%  has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

Dear HodlCrypots,  

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 3.32%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin              slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin              might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin              turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin              did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC              to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC              is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

1530701852.0,TheTradersCorner,I'm back! BTCUSD: is it over? ,"
Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 3.32%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 3.32%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD              and  ZRXUSD              within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 3.32%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 3.32%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 3.32%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 3.43%  and  ZRXUSD 10.97%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

The 50  RSI  has not been pierced through.  Notice how every piercing marked the establishment of a trend reversal. The day candles are currently being supported by the 20EMA (yellow), which has not happened since the current down trend began. The trend looks to be weakening.  However, the bulls seem to be facing resistance, with people in the cryptosphere calling lower lows.

Price 
As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin              did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.   

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6300.0 – 6600.0 zone.

According to various media outlets, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will now succeed in implementing its ban on cryptocurrency business support on July 5. 
Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses. 
Local industry players had widely anticipated the deadline coming into effect, warning customers in advance of the potential for funds to remain in cryptocurrency.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 3.32%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 3.32% .

 Bitcoin              has been in a channel since the move down from 10k. According to this count we're going to see low 4k prices. However, this count is in conflict with the EW theory that wave 3 is most often the longest but never the shortest. So maybe the count is wrong and I'm missing something, but I'm definitely convinced we're going to see at least 5200. The panic at that point will probably decide what the price is going to do. 

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started. 

Wave 1 up & down: 1982 - 660

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 3.32%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.  

It's a combination of graph channels,  elliot wave  and fib relations.

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin              slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin              might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin              turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin              is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin              did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin              is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

The market structure is at 6k. So the longer we stay below 6k the more  bearish  this is going to be. If we stay there for a very short period and move up quickly it wil be fine. If we stay there longer then the real bear market has probably started.

Dear HodlCrypots,  

The following has to be considered making a trade in the current price level of 6515 usd for  bitcoin 3.39%  0.18% .  

There are 3 channels and in 2 of those channels the 4 tends to break out of the channel and soon after that the 5 ticks inside the channel.  

The ( III 0.23% ) therefore hasnt completed yet. It will complete somewhere near the 5200 usd (that's 1315 usd down...).  

When the ( III 0.23% ) completes the (IV) will break out of the channel again but will not surpass the blue  trend line  .  

After that the (real?) bottom will be found at the (V).  

Everything you need to know is in the chart.  

It's a combination of graph channels,  elliot wave  and fib relations.

Hello!  

As pointed out in last quick update: “… 4H TF:  bitcoin 3.40%  slowed-down its run near EMA182. And in order to cool-down overheated TIs -  bitcoin 3.40%  might go to M/BB (SMA20) or M/KC (EMA20) ~6400-6450..."" As you can see we have reached these points. So,  bitcoin 3.40%  turned down from the upper bands of the channels (BB, KC, DC) for testing the middle bands.  Let us analyze further possible movements. 

1) At the 4H time frame:  Bitcoin 3.40%  is actively testing middle bands, with the technical closure below these  channels (aka SMA/EMA20), which potentially should increase the pressure downward. Tis are neutral, but if you apply a retrospective analysis - then still TIs have  bullish  projection.  EMA  6, 9, 12 are mixed, but the same mix was observed on 2 July, after which the impulse went up. 

2) At 5H time frame (I use 5H to smooth the noise from 4H):  Bitcoin 3.40%  did not close below M/KC (EMA20), and overall 5H TIs and MAs more confidently indicate that we should also expect the upward momentum. 

3) At the daily time frame:  Bitcoin 3.40%  is tight in the middle bands of the channels. And in general, yesterday's candle closed above M/KC (EMA20), but below EMA26 and EMA30 - thus the bulls missed the time to develop the trend. TIs indicate the possibility of downward to M/BB (SMA20) and lower to M/DC. 

Conclusion: The current pull-back was within the last forecast, so it would be prudent to start building long position (on increasing basis), which I also wrote yesterday. Opened long at 4H U/KC (20;1) ~6550, 4H middle bands channels (BB, KC, DC) ~6450. Also, there is a possibility of a lower back-test to daily M/BB ~6350 and daily M/DC ~ 6300, where it is also recommended to open a long. SL will be placed below daily L/KC (20; 1). My targets: daily EMA50 ~6900-7000, and then daily EMA100 ~7600-7700.  

Good luck!

Hi, guys. 

I want to show you my idea, since some people are calling for  BTC 3.39%  to go up because it has broken a resistance. 
The idea of going up because a resistance has been broken only seems to work properly in an uptrend, because when there’s a crash like this one, every resistance broken doesn’t necessarily mean it goes up indefinitely. 

I’ve seen these fractals in 2014, and I’m gonna show it to you with a triangle so you can see where  BTC 3.39%  is at the moment. 

I’m not saying it can’t go up, despite the title, because it would be ridiculous. I’m saying it’s more probable it goes down than up, according to fractals, super low  volume , and 50 MA broken (green) and going down to reach 100 MA (blue) and possibly 200 MA (red). 

Hope it shows you a different point of view. 

It’s just an idea. I’m not responsible of your actions. Trade according to what you think. 

Cheers :).

Hi everyone,  

And I'm back (and happy) to posting here in TradingView. It's been a long time, lot's of change and new stuff... Anyhow, back to the chart. 

Break of 5,920.72 was bad! Very bad! It was predictable as an option only but it is what it is, I guess. I'm out of all my positions in  BTCUSD 3.39%  (stopped out at break even). The good point (for bulls) is that this has not been the big sell off and I explained that in one of my free video (I will do one here when I have fixed my mic). So, now what? 
In daily, nothing, we wait because next equal leg area is 4,596.14-3,332.87 and we might not see it! 

Indeed, on 28/06, I called the end of the 4h cycle from 9,948.98 high at 5,870.00 (explained the marginal new low that is ignored) and therefore the end of the cycle from 11,780.00 high and 19,666.00 despite we did not reach the equal leg area in daily and 4h. 







I did not recommend to buy  BTCUSD 3.39%  and I don't recommend to buy here (I bought  ETHUSD 3.43%  and  ZRXUSD 9.94%  within equal leg area lower), so now, we have to wait and see how the structure develops. Here is the path I propose as long as we stay above 404.98.  







From current levels, if we break below 6,259.34, I don't like to buy lower as we are left with 3 waves to the upside from 5,780.00. If we have a marginal new high with  rsi  divergence intact, I will buy any clear 3 waves pullback (purple 2), stop either 161.8% extension or 5,780.00 (depends on the level), repeat and rinse (3, 7 swings is same).  
Also,  volume  seems to be back, especially in altcoins, so we have interesting time ahead. But remember, follow your system, your risk management and don't open the stops...

The 50  RSI  has not been pierced through.  Notice how every piercing marked the establishment of a trend reversal. The day candles are currently being supported by the 20EMA (yellow), which has not happened since the current down trend began. The trend looks to be weakening.  However, the bulls seem to be facing resistance, with people in the cryptosphere calling lower lows.

On the contrary,  bearish  swings in intermediate trend are in tandem with momentum and trend indicators (refer weekly plotting). No traces of recovery, bears are on the verge of retracing 78.6% Fibonacci levels of highs of December-2017 & lows of July-2017. 

Fundamentally, the hot news flashes on the heels of the SEC asking for comments on the new  ETF . 

The SEC, however, recently announced that they propose to ease  ETF  approval rules, especially for low-risk ones. This would allow companies to issue “plain vanilla versions” of the  ETF  without seeking approval. 

Entire universe knows that the previous applications were turned down, with the authority concerning the underlying asset (Bitcoin’s) liquidity and  volatility . 

SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said: “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount – each as of the prior business day.” 

The regulatory frameworks have been lingering around cryptocurrency avenue that appears to be vibrant day-by-day, as institutional money inflow also seems more keen onto move into the market simultaneously. However, the state of affairs will undoubtedly be regulated and offers guiding principles by the SEC’s approach to it.

Price 
As has often happened recently,  Bitcoin 3.39%  did not react on newly-established  Bullish Trend Line  and went sideways sliding below the 6600.0 to 6400 - 6500 zone. This zone still fits in the growth scenario; nonetheless, the longer the price will spend in the lateral low-volatile movement the higher probability of a fall. 6300 – 6500 zone should stay supportive for the  bullish  scenario. From the upside, 6700 – 7000 zone must be crossed with rising volumes in order to confirm that bulls are returning to the market.

Trading in the 6300.0 – 6600.0 zone.

Exchanges and any other business dealing in cryptocurrency will no longer have access to banking services under the ban, meaning traders will be barred from withdrawing rupees via those businesses.

According to my charts and indicators,  BITCOIN 3.39%  WILL CONTINUE ITS CLIMB UP! 

I am looking at 6 different time frames and many indicators. I am also taking into account the general chart structure, candle formation, market cycle, the altcoins market behavior and a few more clues that all points to the same. 

As for bear signals, I am not seeing many...  

We are looking to break $6,800 first, after that, we can aim for $7,000+ and higher. 

This next ""push up"" can happen in as little as 24 hours as it can take 3 days or more. 

These are ""predictions"" that are intended to give you an idea as to when the next push up might happen. This is not what WILL happen, but instead what I believe can happen based on my own experience and the signals I am getting from my charts. 

Use this information in combination with what you read from other analysts and traders to make an informed decision on what to do next when trading  Bitcoin 3.39% .

If we have a drop that is strong enough to change the signals that I am getting from the charts, then I will publish an update and let you know about it. In the meantime, we are bullish in the short term.
