1530205995.0,Jack777,"Ripple in equilibrium, break coming","
Hey guys, XRP  just like big brother  BTC 0.45%  is right now in a tightening range on the 4H with 0,475 as resistance & 0,454 as support. A break here is coming rather sooner than later, and will see a big move. Of course, the direction will highly depend on big brother  BTC 0.45%  .  

A bear break is looking at 0,438 at least. Should those not hold, next supports in the Daily is 0,40 psychological. A bull break could lead at least to the recent highs at 0,5 psychological.  

=> Since we're in a  bearish trend  , the break of equilibriums always favors the bears, than it does the bulls. But you still have to wait for a clear break, especially with those long wicks & fake-outs. So always be more conservative, miss a few percent rather than getting faked out. Set your orders accordingly, and never forget your stop loss. Look at  BTC 0.45%  before trading here, Ripple isn't going anywhere without big brother. I wish you good luck trading! ;)

Here's another coin I don't like, although I was there when my son showed me an algorithm that said ripple was going from 0.6 to over $3. It was right. I didn't believe my son ... my son reminds me of this often. 

Anyhow, is it game over for ripple (the banker's coin)? 

Let's look at the two previous recoveries ... it seems when we crossed either the blue or red  trend line  from the two previous peaks, we had a rally.  

In this instance ... it's not reacting ... yet.  

We have already crossed one of those two  trend lines  ... last one (blue) will be crossed if it holds at this level in less than 24 hours. 
Now, we might not get an immediate rise, especially if  BTC 0.48%  decides to catch a train south, but it should react within the next 3 to 7 days. 

If it doesn't ... ouch. 

Tonnes of support in the green box, but the range is WAY too wide (down to 0.15).  We are testing yearly lows, and a break below that could send it down significantly.   

Like BCH, if I were to play this coin, I'd wait for a confirmed bottom and pick up the ride going up!

I am a long-term holder of XRP.  It seems the current cycle has been great for buying but terrible for selling.   It doesn't look like that is changing soon. 

The current pattern for XRP in conjunction with the pattern  BTC 0.47%  is on will likely bring us to lower levels in the immediate future. 

It looks like XRP will hit at least .43 before we see any reversal.  Much of this will have to do with how low  BTC 0.47%  goes. 

I think we are at the tail end of whatever this last consolidation period has been about.   BTC 0.47%  below $6000 is bad for everyone - but especially bad for coins like XRP. 

Some people feel like they missed the big crypto opportunity and they are too ""late to the game"".  With today's prices and more people  
""in crypto"" the upside is better than its ever been. 

Crypto has only begun as an asset class - we havent seen a fraction of what it is capable.  XRP is a real project with real potential.   

We are in a position right now where XRP is extremely affordable given its potential.  Whether you choose to take advantage of the opportunity or not is up to you and your due diligence. 

Lets hope this downtrend ends soon and those of us buying can enjoy the fruits of our labor!

Comment:
					We broke through the neckline confirming the pattern is in play - don't be surprised to see .43 as mentioned above.
