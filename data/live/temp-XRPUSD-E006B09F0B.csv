1530259682.0,VARZAR_INVESTMENT,Trading plan: XRPUSD (Ripple),"
The Ripple rate continues its decline. 
Priority of the day: decrease in the rate of XRPUSD to $ 0.41. 
Bearish trend  of Ripple continues. Today we do not rush to sell Ripple, because we are counting on a bounce of its rate upwards, with the nearest target of $ 0.48. 
We are out of the market today, because other scenarios for the movement of Ripple rate are likely to happen. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will decrease from $ 0.44 to $ 0.41. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will remain in flat. 
Alternative scenario: 
We forecast a rapid bounce of Ripple rate upwards, and we will look for opportunities for its purchase.
