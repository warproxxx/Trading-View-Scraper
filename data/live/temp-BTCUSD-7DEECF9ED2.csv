Guys, I decided not to trade. I’m really angry with  BTC -0.32% . In fact, not with  BTC -0.32%  but with bots and exchanges allowing bots to work because of the huge amount of money they earn with fees. 
Bots buy, exchanges earn fees, people get in, more fees. The movement suddenly stops, people sell, more fees for the exchanges. Bots purchase again, and more fees. And so on, til these bots decide to sell everything, take their profits, and drive people to rekt city. 

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Hi lads,  
I stopped charting and looking up TA for a while. 
IMO 1.06%  the manipulation is and was at such a high level that no chart was helpful. Anytime shorts built up, they'd pump it up 200-300 dollars. Longs would build up, they'd dump it (the exchanges themselves). So it was just a guessing game. 

Anyways, in the perfect world it'll make something like this. But since many others are betting on a similar chart... will the Market Makers allow it to happen?

Hello my friends, 
Here we are with another  BTC -0.32%  Realtime,it's one month and half that with started this idea together and we will continue it to #666 and even more.lol.Again thanks all of you to make me proud of what i do.So let's look at our AMAZING  BTC -0.32%  chart.I want to name it ""iH&S WARZ"" . haahaa 
I'm so excited to show you what i wait for it for month,but first let's check history together,not so long,few month ago. 






In last FEB and MARCH many people thought bear market is near to end,and they had an iH&S that believed it can help to market back to bull market(chart above).Magic Poop was first person that started this idea and because of it i named that failed iH&S ,Poop iH&S.As you remember or see here that pattern failed,nt because of no proper and fit  volume profile  or anything else,just because it was too early to finish  btc -0.32%  correction.That was just start of bear market.After that market continued to move in cycle and print lower highs,that i still believe we formed a  bullish wedge  with that price actions.Till we reach this point.After a long downward from 10k we reached an almost new low and after that we started a new wave that can't name it new upward yet and can be just a retrace.But what is important is we brok that  downward channel  and 4 important resistance and we prove some supports,too.Let's look at this achievements from last  BTC -0.32%  Realtime again. 






As you can see we have a new and fresh channel here and it made on a strong  RSI  level that prove itself till now.We have  ichimoku  that broke and we are above it in a good mood.But what can change our retrace phase to a different phase?What can show us that we are in new bull market?Reversal signs. 
As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.32%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money. 
Thanks again to read my new  BTC -0.32%  Realtime,Thanks all of you to made this topic alive till now.Please give it a like if you like it,Believe me it's really make me happy.Leave a comment bellow to show me what you think.

In last FEB and MARCH many people thought bear market is near to end,and they had an iH&S that believed it can help to market back to bull market(chart above).Magic Poop was first person that started this idea and because of it i named that failed iH&S ,Poop iH&S.As you remember or see here that pattern failed,nt because of no proper and fit  volume profile  or anything else,just because it was too early to finish  btc -0.29%  correction.That was just start of bear market.After that market continued to move in cycle and print lower highs,that i still believe we formed a  bullish wedge  with that price actions.Till we reach this point.After a long downward from 10k we reached an almost new low and after that we started a new wave that can't name it new upward yet and can be just a retrace.But what is important is we brok that  downward channel  and 4 important resistance and we prove some supports,too.Let's look at this achievements from last  BTC -0.29%  Realtime again. 






As you can see we have a new and fresh channel here and it made on a strong  RSI  level that prove itself till now.We have  ichimoku  that broke and we are above it in a good mood.But what can change our retrace phase to a different phase?What can show us that we are in new bull market?Reversal signs. 
As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.29%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money. 
Thanks again to read my new  BTC -0.29%  Realtime,Thanks all of you to made this topic alive till now.Please give it a like if you like it,Believe me it's really make me happy.Leave a comment bellow to show me what you think.

Guys, I decided not to trade. I’m really angry with  BTC -0.29% . In fact, not with  BTC -0.29%  but with bots and exchanges allowing bots to work because of the huge amount of money they earn with fees. 
Bots buy, exchanges earn fees, people get in, more fees. The movement suddenly stops, people sell, more fees for the exchanges. Bots purchase again, and more fees. And so on, til these bots decide to sell everything, take their profits, and drive people to rekt city. 

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Hi lads,  
I stopped charting and looking up TA for a while. 
IMO 1.06%  the manipulation is and was at such a high level that no chart was helpful. Anytime shorts built up, they'd pump it up 200-300 dollars. Longs would build up, they'd dump it (the exchanges themselves). So it was just a guessing game. 

Anyways, in the perfect world it'll make something like this. But since many others are betting on a similar chart... will the Market Makers allow it to happen? 
You be the judge, Good luck to all!

Guys, I decided not to trade. I’m really angry with  BTC             . In fact, not with  BTC              but with bots and exchanges allowing bots to work because of the huge amount of money they earn with fees. 
Bots buy, exchanges earn fees, people get in, more fees. The movement suddenly stops, people sell, more fees for the exchanges. Bots purchase again, and more fees. And so on, til these bots decide to sell everything, take their profits, and drive people to rekt city. 

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Hi lads,  
I stopped charting and looking up TA for a while. 
IMO              the manipulation is and was at such a high level that no chart was helpful. Anytime shorts built up, they'd pump it up 200-300 dollars. Longs would build up, they'd dump it (the exchanges themselves). So it was just a guessing game. 

Anyways, in the perfect world it'll make something like this. But since many others are betting on a similar chart... will the Market Makers allow it to happen? 
You be the judge, Good luck to all!

Hello my friends, 
Here we are with another  BTC -0.29%  Realtime,it's one month and half that with started this idea together and we will continue it to #666 and even more.lol.Again thanks all of you to make me proud of what i do.So let's look at our AMAZING  BTC -0.29%  chart.I want to name it ""iH&S WARZ"" . haahaa 
I'm so excited to show you what i wait for it for month,but first let's check history together,not so long,few month ago. 






In last FEB and MARCH many people thought bear market is near to end,and they had an iH&S that believed it can help to market back to bull market(chart above).Magic Poop was first person that started this idea and because of it i named that failed iH&S ,Poop iH&S.As you remember or see here that pattern failed,nt because of no proper and fit  volume profile  or anything else,just because it was too early to finish  btc -0.29%  correction.That was just start of bear market.After that market continued to move in cycle and print lower highs,that i still believe we formed a  bullish wedge  with that price actions.Till we reach this point.After a long downward from 10k we reached an almost new low and after that we started a new wave that can't name it new upward yet and can be just a retrace.But what is important is we brok that  downward channel  and 4 important resistance and we prove some supports,too.Let's look at this achievements from last  BTC -0.29%  Realtime again. 






As you can see we have a new and fresh channel here and it made on a strong  RSI  level that prove itself till now.We have  ichimoku  that broke and we are above it in a good mood.But what can change our retrace phase to a different phase?What can show us that we are in new bull market?Reversal signs. 
As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.29%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money. 
Thanks again to read my new  BTC -0.29%  Realtime,Thanks all of you to made this topic alive till now.Please give it a like if you like it,Believe me it's really make me happy.Leave a comment bellow to show me what you think.

Hi lads,  
I stopped charting and looking up TA for a while. 
IMO 1.06%  the manipulation is and was at such a high level that no chart was helpful. Anytime shorts built up, they'd pump it up 200-300 dollars. Longs would build up, they'd dump it (the exchanges themselves). So it was just a guessing game. 

Anyways, in the perfect world it'll make something like this. But since many others are betting on a similar chart... will the Market Makers allow it to happen? 
You be the judge, Good luck to all!

Hello my friends, 
Here we are with another  BTC -0.29%  Realtime,it's one month and half that with started this idea together and we will continue it to #666 and even more.lol.Again thanks all of you to make me proud of what i do.So let's look at our AMAZING  BTC -0.29%  chart.I want to name it ""iH&S WARZ"" . haahaa 
I'm so excited to show you what i wait for it for month,but first let's check history together,not so long,few month ago. 






In last FEB and MARCH many people thought bear market is near to end,and they had an iH&S that believed it can help to market back to bull market(chart above).Magic Poop was first person that started this idea and because of it i named that failed iH&S ,Poop iH&S.As you remember or see here that pattern failed,nt because of no proper and fit  volume profile  or anything else,just because it was too early to finish  btc -0.29%  correction.That was just start of bear market.After that market continued to move in cycle and print lower highs,that i still believe we formed a  bullish wedge  with that price actions.Till we reach this point.After a long downward from 10k we reached an almost new low and after that we started a new wave that can't name it new upward yet and can be just a retrace.But what is important is we brok that  downward channel  and 4 important resistance and we prove some supports,too.Let's look at this achievements from last  BTC -0.29%  Realtime again. 






As you can see we have a new and fresh channel here and it made on a strong  RSI  level that prove itself till now.We have  ichimoku  that broke and we are above it in a good mood.But what can change our retrace phase to a different phase?What can show us that we are in new bull market?Reversal signs. 
As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.29%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money. 
Thanks again to read my new  BTC -0.29%  Realtime,Thanks all of you to made this topic alive till now.Please give it a like if you like it,Believe me it's really make me happy.Leave a comment bellow to show me what you think.

Guys, I decided not to trade. I’m really angry with  BTC -0.29% . In fact, not with  BTC -0.29%  but with bots and exchanges allowing bots to work because of the huge amount of money they earn with fees. 
Bots buy, exchanges earn fees, people get in, more fees. The movement suddenly stops, people sell, more fees for the exchanges. Bots purchase again, and more fees. And so on, til these bots decide to sell everything, take their profits, and drive people to rekt city. 

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Guys, I decided not to trade. I’m really angry with  BTC             . In fact, not with  BTC              but with bots and exchanges allowing bots to work because of the huge amount of money they earn with fees. 
Bots buy, exchanges earn fees, people get in, more fees. The movement suddenly stops, people sell, more fees for the exchanges. Bots purchase again, and more fees. And so on, til these bots decide to sell everything, take their profits, and drive people to rekt city. 

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Hi lads,  
I stopped charting and looking up TA for a while. 
IMO              the manipulation is and was at such a high level that no chart was helpful. Anytime shorts built up, they'd pump it up 200-300 dollars. Longs would build up, they'd dump it (the exchanges themselves). So it was just a guessing game. 

Anyways, in the perfect world it'll make something like this. But since many others are betting on a similar chart... will the Market Makers allow it to happen? 
You be the judge, Good luck to all!

1531041226.0,Peymana71,BTC Realtime Analyse #6,"
Hello my friends, 
Here we are with another  BTC -0.28%  Realtime,it's one month and half that with started this idea together and we will continue it to #666 and even more.lol.Again thanks all of you to make me proud of what i do.So let's look at our AMAZING  BTC -0.28%  chart.I want to name it ""iH&S WARZ"" . haahaa 
I'm so excited to show you what i wait for it for month,but first let's check history together,not so long,few month ago. 






In last FEB and MARCH many people thought bear market is near to end,and they had an iH&S that believed it can help to market back to bull market(chart above).Magic Poop was first person that started this idea and because of it i named that failed iH&S ,Poop iH&S.As you remember or see here that pattern failed,nt because of no proper and fit  volume profile  or anything else,just because it was too early to finish  btc -0.28%  correction.That was just start of bear market.After that market continued to move in cycle and print lower highs,that i still believe we formed a  bullish wedge  with that price actions.Till we reach this point.After a long downward from 10k we reached an almost new low and after that we started a new wave that can't name it new upward yet and can be just a retrace.But what is important is we brok that  downward channel  and 4 important resistance and we prove some supports,too.Let's look at this achievements from last  BTC -0.28%  Realtime again. 






As you can see we have a new and fresh channel here and it made on a strong  RSI  level that prove itself till now.We have  ichimoku  that broke and we are above it in a good mood.But what can change our retrace phase to a different phase?What can show us that we are in new bull market?Reversal signs. 
As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.28%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money. 
Thanks again to read my new  BTC -0.28%  Realtime,Thanks all of you to made this topic alive till now.Please give it a like if you like it,Believe me it's really make me happy.Leave a comment bellow to show me what you think.

Bots buy, exchanges earn fees, people get in, more fees. The movement suddenly stops, people sell, more fees for the exchanges. Bots purchase again, and more fees. And so on, til these bots decide to sell everything, take their profits, and drive people to rekt city. 

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Hi lads,  
I stopped charting and looking up TA for a while. 
IMO 1.06%  the manipulation is and was at such a high level that no chart was helpful. Anytime shorts built up, they'd pump it up 200-300 dollars. Longs would build up, they'd dump it (the exchanges themselves). So it was just a guessing game. 

Anyways, in the perfect world it'll make something like this. But since many others are betting on a similar chart... will the Market Makers allow it to happen? 
You be the judge, Good luck to all!

Hello my friends, 
Here we are with another  BTC -0.28%  Realtime,it's one month and half that with started this idea together and we will continue it to #666 and even more.lol.Again thanks all of you to make me proud of what i do.So let's look at our AMAZING  BTC -0.28%  chart.I want to name it ""iH&S WARZ"" . haahaa 
I'm so excited to show you what i wait for it for month,but first let's check history together,not so long,few month ago. 






In last FEB and MARCH many people thought bear market is near to end,and they had an iH&S that believed it can help to market back to bull market(chart above).Magic Poop was first person that started this idea and because of it i named that failed iH&S ,Poop iH&S.As you remember or see here that pattern failed,nt because of no proper and fit  volume profile  or anything else,just because it was too early to finish  btc -0.28%  correction.That was just start of bear market.After that market continued to move in cycle and print lower highs,that i still believe we formed a  bullish wedge  with that price actions.Till we reach this point.After a long downward from 10k we reached an almost new low and after that we started a new wave that can't name it new upward yet and can be just a retrace.But what is important is we brok that  downward channel  and 4 important resistance and we prove some supports,too.Let's look at this achievements from last  BTC -0.28%  Realtime again. 






As you can see we have a new and fresh channel here and it made on a strong  RSI  level that prove itself till now.We have  ichimoku  that broke and we are above it in a good mood.But what can change our retrace phase to a different phase?What can show us that we are in new bull market?Reversal signs. 
As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.28%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money. 
Thanks again to read my new  BTC -0.28%  Realtime,Thanks all of you to made this topic alive till now.Please give it a like if you like it,Believe me it's really make me happy.Leave a comment bellow to show me what you think.

Guys, I decided not to trade. I’m really angry with  BTC -0.28% . In fact, not with  BTC -0.28%  but with bots and exchanges allowing bots to work because of the huge amount of money they earn with fees. 
Bots buy, exchanges earn fees, people get in, more fees. The movement suddenly stops, people sell, more fees for the exchanges. Bots purchase again, and more fees. And so on, til these bots decide to sell everything, take their profits, and drive people to rekt city. 

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Hi lads,  
I stopped charting and looking up TA for a while. 
IMO 1.06%  the manipulation is and was at such a high level that no chart was helpful. Anytime shorts built up, they'd pump it up 200-300 dollars. Longs would build up, they'd dump it (the exchanges themselves). So it was just a guessing game. 

Anyways, in the perfect world it'll make something like this. But since many others are betting on a similar chart... will the Market Makers allow it to happen? 
You be the judge, Good luck to all!

Hello my friends, 
Here we are with another  BTC -0.28%  Realtime,it's one month and half that with started this idea together and we will continue it to #666 and even more.lol.Again thanks all of you to make me proud of what i do.So let's look at our AMAZING  BTC -0.28%  chart.I want to name it ""iH&S WARZ"" . haahaa 
I'm so excited to show you what i wait for it for month,but first let's check history together,not so long,few month ago. 






In last FEB and MARCH many people thought bear market is near to end,and they had an iH&S that believed it can help to market back to bull market(chart above).Magic Poop was first person that started this idea and because of it i named that failed iH&S ,Poop iH&S.As you remember or see here that pattern failed,nt because of no proper and fit  volume profile  or anything else,just because it was too early to finish  btc -0.28%  correction.That was just start of bear market.After that market continued to move in cycle and print lower highs,that i still believe we formed a  bullish wedge  with that price actions.Till we reach this point.After a long downward from 10k we reached an almost new low and after that we started a new wave that can't name it new upward yet and can be just a retrace.But what is important is we brok that  downward channel  and 4 important resistance and we prove some supports,too.Let's look at this achievements from last  BTC -0.28%  Realtime again. 






As you can see we have a new and fresh channel here and it made on a strong  RSI  level that prove itself till now.We have  ichimoku  that broke and we are above it in a good mood.But what can change our retrace phase to a different phase?What can show us that we are in new bull market?Reversal signs. 
As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.28%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money.

Guys, I decided not to trade. I’m really angry with  BTC -0.26% . In fact, not with  BTC -0.26%  but with bots and exchanges allowing bots to work because of the huge amount of money they earn with fees. 
Bots buy, exchanges earn fees, people get in, more fees. The movement suddenly stops, people sell, more fees for the exchanges. Bots purchase again, and more fees. And so on, til these bots decide to sell everything, take their profits, and drive people to rekt city. 

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Hi lads,  
I stopped charting and looking up TA for a while. 
IMO 1.06%  the manipulation is and was at such a high level that no chart was helpful. Anytime shorts built up, they'd pump it up 200-300 dollars. Longs would build up, they'd dump it (the exchanges themselves). So it was just a guessing game. 

Anyways, in the perfect world it'll make something like this. But since many others are betting on a similar chart... will the Market Makers allow it to happen? 
You be the judge, Good luck to all!

Hello my friends, 
Here we are with another  BTC -0.26%  Realtime,it's one month and half that with started this idea together and we will continue it to #666 and even more.lol.Again thanks all of you to make me proud of what i do.So let's look at our AMAZING  BTC -0.26%  chart.I want to name it ""iH&S WARZ"" . haahaa 
I'm so excited to show you what i wait for it for month,but first let's check history together,not so long,few month ago. 






In last FEB and MARCH many people thought bear market is near to end,and they had an iH&S that believed it can help to market back to bull market(chart above).Magic Poop was first person that started this idea and because of it i named that failed iH&S ,Poop iH&S.As you remember or see here that pattern failed,nt because of no proper and fit  volume profile  or anything else,just because it was too early to finish  btc -0.26%  correction.That was just start of bear market.After that market continued to move in cycle and print lower highs,that i still believe we formed a  bullish wedge  with that price actions.Till we reach this point.After a long downward from 10k we reached an almost new low and after that we started a new wave that can't name it new upward yet and can be just a retrace.But what is important is we brok that  downward channel  and 4 important resistance and we prove some supports,too.Let's look at this achievements from last  BTC -0.26%  Realtime again. 






As you can see we have a new and fresh channel here and it made on a strong  RSI  level that prove itself till now.We have  ichimoku  that broke and we are above it in a good mood.But what can change our retrace phase to a different phase?What can show us that we are in new bull market?Reversal signs. 
As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.26%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money. 
Thanks again to read my new  BTC -0.26%  Realtime,Thanks all of you to made this topic alive till now.Please give it a like if you like it,Believe me it's really make me happy.Leave a comment bellow to show me what you think.

As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.07%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money. 
Thanks again to read my new  BTC -0.07%  Realtime,Thanks all of you to made this topic alive till now.Please give it a like if you like it,Believe me it's really make me happy.Leave a comment bellow to show me what you think.

Guys, I decided not to trade. I’m really angry with  BTC -0.21% . In fact, not with  BTC -0.21%  but with bots and exchanges allowing bots to work because of the huge amount of money they earn with fees. 
Bots buy, exchanges earn fees, people get in, more fees. The movement suddenly stops, people sell, more fees for the exchanges. Bots purchase again, and more fees. And so on, til these bots decide to sell everything, take their profits, and drive people to rekt city. 

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Hi lads,  
I stopped charting and looking up TA for a while. 
IMO 1.06%  the manipulation is and was at such a high level that no chart was helpful. Anytime shorts built up, they'd pump it up 200-300 dollars. Longs would build up, they'd dump it (the exchanges themselves). So it was just a guessing game. 

Anyways, in the perfect world it'll make something like this. But since many others are betting on a similar chart... will the Market Makers allow it to happen? 
You be the judge, Good luck to all!

Guys, I decided not to trade. I’m really angry with  BTC -0.16% . In fact, not with  BTC -0.16%  but with bots and exchanges allowing bots to work because of the huge amount of money they earn with fees. 
Bots buy, exchanges earn fees, people get in, more fees. The movement suddenly stops, people sell, more fees for the exchanges. Bots purchase again, and more fees. And so on, til these bots decide to sell everything, take their profits, and drive people to rekt city. 

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Hi lads,  
I stopped charting and looking up TA for a while. 
IMO 1.06%  the manipulation is and was at such a high level that no chart was helpful. Anytime shorts built up, they'd pump it up 200-300 dollars. Longs would build up, they'd dump it (the exchanges themselves). So it was just a guessing game. 

Anyways, in the perfect world it'll make something like this. But since many others are betting on a similar chart... will the Market Makers allow it to happen?

Hello my friends, 
Here we are with another  BTC -0.16%  Realtime,it's one month and half that with started this idea together and we will continue it to #666 and even more.lol.Again thanks all of you to make me proud of what i do.So let's look at our AMAZING  BTC -0.16%  chart.I want to name it ""iH&S WARZ"" . haahaa 
I'm so excited to show you what i wait for it for month,but first let's check history together,not so long,few month ago. 






In last FEB and MARCH many people thought bear market is near to end,and they had an iH&S that believed it can help to market back to bull market(chart above).Magic Poop was first person that started this idea and because of it i named that failed iH&S ,Poop iH&S.As you remember or see here that pattern failed,nt because of no proper and fit  volume profile  or anything else,just because it was too early to finish  btc -0.16%  correction.That was just start of bear market.After that market continued to move in cycle and print lower highs,that i still believe we formed a  bullish wedge  with that price actions.Till we reach this point.After a long downward from 10k we reached an almost new low and after that we started a new wave that can't name it new upward yet and can be just a retrace.But what is important is we brok that  downward channel  and 4 important resistance and we prove some supports,too.Let's look at this achievements from last  BTC -0.16%  Realtime again. 






As you can see we have a new and fresh channel here and it made on a strong  RSI  level that prove itself till now.We have  ichimoku  that broke and we are above it in a good mood.But what can change our retrace phase to a different phase?What can show us that we are in new bull market?Reversal signs. 
As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.16%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money. 
Thanks again to read my new  BTC -0.16%  Realtime,Thanks all of you to made this topic alive till now.Please give it a like if you like it,Believe me it's really make me happy.Leave a comment bellow to show me what you think.

You be the judge, Good luck to all!

1531041226.0,Peymana71,BTC Realtime Analyse #6,"
Hello my friends, 
Here we are with another  BTC -0.23%  Realtime,it's one month and half that with started this idea together and we will continue it to #666 and even more.lol.Again thanks all of you to make me proud of what i do.So let's look at our AMAZING  BTC -0.23%  chart.I want to name it ""iH&S WARZ"" . haahaa 
I'm so excited to show you what i wait for it for month,but first let's check history together,not so long,few month ago. 






In last FEB and MARCH many people thought bear market is near to end,and they had an iH&S that believed it can help to market back to bull market(chart above).Magic Poop was first person that started this idea and because of it i named that failed iH&S ,Poop iH&S.As you remember or see here that pattern failed,nt because of no proper and fit  volume profile  or anything else,just because it was too early to finish  btc -0.23%  correction.That was just start of bear market.After that market continued to move in cycle and print lower highs,that i still believe we formed a  bullish wedge  with that price actions.Till we reach this point.After a long downward from 10k we reached an almost new low and after that we started a new wave that can't name it new upward yet and can be just a retrace.But what is important is we brok that  downward channel  and 4 important resistance and we prove some supports,too.Let's look at this achievements from last  BTC -0.23%  Realtime again. 






As you can see we have a new and fresh channel here and it made on a strong  RSI  level that prove itself till now.We have  ichimoku  that broke and we are above it in a good mood.But what can change our retrace phase to a different phase?What can show us that we are in new bull market?Reversal signs. 
As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.23%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money. 
Thanks again to read my new  BTC -0.23%  Realtime,Thanks all of you to made this topic alive till now.Please give it a like if you like it,Believe me it's really make me happy.Leave a comment bellow to show me what you think.

Guys, I decided not to trade. I’m really angry with  BTC -0.18% . In fact, not with  BTC -0.18%  but with bots and exchanges allowing bots to work because of the huge amount of money they earn with fees. 
Bots buy, exchanges earn fees, people get in, more fees. The movement suddenly stops, people sell, more fees for the exchanges. Bots purchase again, and more fees. And so on, til these bots decide to sell everything, take their profits, and drive people to rekt city. 

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Guys, I decided not to trade. I’m really angry with  BTC -0.17% . In fact, not with  BTC -0.17%  but with bots and exchanges allowing bots to work because of the huge amount of money they earn with fees. 
Bots buy, exchanges earn fees, people get in, more fees. The movement suddenly stops, people sell, more fees for the exchanges. Bots purchase again, and more fees. And so on, til these bots decide to sell everything, take their profits, and drive people to rekt city. 

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Hi lads,  
I stopped charting and looking up TA for a while. 
IMO 1.06%  the manipulation is and was at such a high level that no chart was helpful. Anytime shorts built up, they'd pump it up 200-300 dollars. Longs would build up, they'd dump it (the exchanges themselves). So it was just a guessing game. 

Anyways, in the perfect world it'll make something like this. But since many others are betting on a similar chart... will the Market Makers allow it to happen? 
You be the judge, Good luck to all!

1531041226.0,Peymana71,BTC Realtime Analyse #6,"
Hello my friends, 
Here we are with another  BTC -0.17%  Realtime,it's one month and half that with started this idea together and we will continue it to #666 and even more.lol.Again thanks all of you to make me proud of what i do.So let's look at our AMAZING  BTC -0.17%  chart.I want to name it ""iH&S WARZ"" . haahaa 
I'm so excited to show you what i wait for it for month,but first let's check history together,not so long,few month ago. 






In last FEB and MARCH many people thought bear market is near to end,and they had an iH&S that believed it can help to market back to bull market(chart above).Magic Poop was first person that started this idea and because of it i named that failed iH&S ,Poop iH&S.As you remember or see here that pattern failed,nt because of no proper and fit  volume profile  or anything else,just because it was too early to finish  btc -0.17%  correction.That was just start of bear market.After that market continued to move in cycle and print lower highs,that i still believe we formed a  bullish wedge  with that price actions.Till we reach this point.After a long downward from 10k we reached an almost new low and after that we started a new wave that can't name it new upward yet and can be just a retrace.But what is important is we brok that  downward channel  and 4 important resistance and we prove some supports,too.Let's look at this achievements from last  BTC -0.17%  Realtime again. 






As you can see we have a new and fresh channel here and it made on a strong  RSI  level that prove itself till now.We have  ichimoku  that broke and we are above it in a good mood.But what can change our retrace phase to a different phase?What can show us that we are in new bull market?Reversal signs. 
As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.17%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money. 
Thanks again to read my new  BTC -0.17%  Realtime,Thanks all of you to made this topic alive till now.Please give it a like if you like it,Believe me it's really make me happy.Leave a comment bellow to show me what you think.

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Hi lads,  
I stopped charting and looking up TA for a while. 
IMO 1.06%  the manipulation is and was at such a high level that no chart was helpful. Anytime shorts built up, they'd pump it up 200-300 dollars. Longs would build up, they'd dump it (the exchanges themselves). So it was just a guessing game. 

Anyways, in the perfect world it'll make something like this. But since many others are betting on a similar chart... will the Market Makers allow it to happen? 
You be the judge, Good luck to all!

Hello my friends, 
Here we are with another  BTC -0.26%  Realtime,it's one month and half that with started this idea together and we will continue it to #666 and even more.lol.Again thanks all of you to make me proud of what i do.So let's look at our AMAZING  BTC -0.26%  chart.I want to name it ""iH&S WARZ"" . haahaa 
I'm so excited to show you what i wait for it for month,but first let's check history together,not so long,few month ago. 






In last FEB and MARCH many people thought bear market is near to end,and they had an iH&S that believed it can help to market back to bull market(chart above).Magic Poop was first person that started this idea and because of it i named that failed iH&S ,Poop iH&S.As you remember or see here that pattern failed,nt because of no proper and fit  volume profile  or anything else,just because it was too early to finish  btc -0.26%  correction.That was just start of bear market.After that market continued to move in cycle and print lower highs,that i still believe we formed a  bullish wedge  with that price actions.Till we reach this point.After a long downward from 10k we reached an almost new low and after that we started a new wave that can't name it new upward yet and can be just a retrace.But what is important is we brok that  downward channel  and 4 important resistance and we prove some supports,too.Let's look at this achievements from last  BTC -0.26%  Realtime again. 






As you can see we have a new and fresh channel here and it made on a strong  RSI  level that prove itself till now.We have  ichimoku  that broke and we are above it in a good mood.But what can change our retrace phase to a different phase?What can show us that we are in new bull market?Reversal signs. 
As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.26%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money. 
Thanks again to read my new  BTC -0.26%  Realtime,Thanks all of you to made this topic alive till now.Please give it a like if you like it,Believe me it's really make me happy.Leave a comment bellow to show me what you think. 
You can join my Telegram channel @ T.me/peymana71. I will start to work there as soon as it reach a proper number of follower.

 Elliot wave  is about to form wave 3, which is certainly the biggest wave of a cycle.

Guys, I decided not to trade. I’m really angry with  BTC             . In fact, not with  BTC              but with bots and exchanges allowing bots to work because of the huge amount of money they earn with fees. 
Bots buy, exchanges earn fees, people get in, more fees. The movement suddenly stops, people sell, more fees for the exchanges. Bots purchase again, and more fees. And so on, til these bots decide to sell everything, take their profits, and drive people to rekt city. 

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Hi lads,  
I stopped charting and looking up TA for a while. 
IMO 1.06%  the manipulation is and was at such a high level that no chart was helpful. Anytime shorts built up, they'd pump it up 200-300 dollars. Longs would build up, they'd dump it (the exchanges themselves). So it was just a guessing game. 

Anyways, in the perfect world it'll make something like this. But since many others are betting on a similar chart... will the Market Makers allow it to happen? 
You be the judge, Good luck to all!

1531041226.0,Peymana71,BTC Realtime Analyse #6,"
Hello my friends, 
Here we are with another  BTC -0.25%  Realtime,it's one month and half that with started this idea together and we will continue it to #666 and even more.lol.Again thanks all of you to make me proud of what i do.So let's look at our AMAZING  BTC -0.25%  chart.I want to name it ""iH&S WARZ"" . haahaa 
I'm so excited to show you what i wait for it for month,but first let's check history together,not so long,few month ago. 






In last FEB and MARCH many people thought bear market is near to end,and they had an iH&S that believed it can help to market back to bull market(chart above).Magic Poop was first person that started this idea and because of it i named that failed iH&S ,Poop iH&S.As you remember or see here that pattern failed,nt because of no proper and fit  volume profile  or anything else,just because it was too early to finish  btc -0.25%  correction.That was just start of bear market.After that market continued to move in cycle and print lower highs,that i still believe we formed a  bullish wedge  with that price actions.Till we reach this point.After a long downward from 10k we reached an almost new low and after that we started a new wave that can't name it new upward yet and can be just a retrace.But what is important is we brok that  downward channel  and 4 important resistance and we prove some supports,too.Let's look at this achievements from last  BTC -0.25%  Realtime again. 






As you can see we have a new and fresh channel here and it made on a strong  RSI  level that prove itself till now.We have  ichimoku  that broke and we are above it in a good mood.But what can change our retrace phase to a different phase?What can show us that we are in new bull market?Reversal signs. 
As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.25%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money.

Guys, I decided not to trade. I’m really angry with  BTC -0.25% . In fact, not with  BTC -0.25%  but with bots and exchanges allowing bots to work because of the huge amount of money they earn with fees. 
Bots buy, exchanges earn fees, people get in, more fees. The movement suddenly stops, people sell, more fees for the exchanges. Bots purchase again, and more fees. And so on, til these bots decide to sell everything, take their profits, and drive people to rekt city. 

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Hi lads,  
I stopped charting and looking up TA for a while. 
IMO              the manipulation is and was at such a high level that no chart was helpful. Anytime shorts built up, they'd pump it up 200-300 dollars. Longs would build up, they'd dump it (the exchanges themselves). So it was just a guessing game. 

Anyways, in the perfect world it'll make something like this. But since many others are betting on a similar chart... will the Market Makers allow it to happen? 
You be the judge, Good luck to all!

Hello my friends, 
Here we are with another  BTC -0.25%  Realtime,it's one month and half that with started this idea together and we will continue it to #666 and even more.lol.Again thanks all of you to make me proud of what i do.So let's look at our AMAZING  BTC -0.25%  chart.I want to name it ""iH&S WARZ"" . haahaa 
I'm so excited to show you what i wait for it for month,but first let's check history together,not so long,few month ago. 






In last FEB and MARCH many people thought bear market is near to end,and they had an iH&S that believed it can help to market back to bull market(chart above).Magic Poop was first person that started this idea and because of it i named that failed iH&S ,Poop iH&S.As you remember or see here that pattern failed,nt because of no proper and fit  volume profile  or anything else,just because it was too early to finish  btc -0.25%  correction.That was just start of bear market.After that market continued to move in cycle and print lower highs,that i still believe we formed a  bullish wedge  with that price actions.Till we reach this point.After a long downward from 10k we reached an almost new low and after that we started a new wave that can't name it new upward yet and can be just a retrace.But what is important is we brok that  downward channel  and 4 important resistance and we prove some supports,too.Let's look at this achievements from last  BTC -0.25%  Realtime again. 






As you can see we have a new and fresh channel here and it made on a strong  RSI  level that prove itself till now.We have  ichimoku  that broke and we are above it in a good mood.But what can change our retrace phase to a different phase?What can show us that we are in new bull market?Reversal signs. 
As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.25%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money. 
Thanks again to read my new  BTC -0.25%  Realtime,Thanks all of you to made this topic alive till now.Please give it a like if you like it,Believe me it's really make me happy.Leave a comment bellow to show me what you think.

As you can see we have a new and fresh channel here and it made on a strong  RSI  level that prove itself till now.We have  ichimoku  that broke and we are above it in a good mood.But what can change our retrace phase to a different phase?What can show us that we are in new bull market?Reversal signs. 
As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.23%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money. 
Thanks again to read my new  BTC -0.23%  Realtime,Thanks all of you to made this topic alive till now.Please give it a like if you like it,Believe me it's really make me happy.Leave a comment bellow to show me what you think.

Guys, I decided not to trade. I’m really angry with  BTC -0.22% . In fact, not with  BTC -0.22%  but with bots and exchanges allowing bots to work because of the huge amount of money they earn with fees. 
Bots buy, exchanges earn fees, people get in, more fees. The movement suddenly stops, people sell, more fees for the exchanges. Bots purchase again, and more fees. And so on, til these bots decide to sell everything, take their profits, and drive people to rekt city. 

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Hi lads,  
I stopped charting and looking up TA for a while. 
IMO 1.06%  the manipulation is and was at such a high level that no chart was helpful. Anytime shorts built up, they'd pump it up 200-300 dollars. Longs would build up, they'd dump it (the exchanges themselves). So it was just a guessing game. 

Anyways, in the perfect world it'll make something like this. But since many others are betting on a similar chart... will the Market Makers allow it to happen? 
You be the judge, Good luck to all!

Guys, I decided not to trade. I’m really angry with  BTC             . In fact, not with  BTC              but with bots and exchanges allowing bots to work because of the huge amount of money they earn with fees. 
Bots buy, exchanges earn fees, people get in, more fees. The movement suddenly stops, people sell, more fees for the exchanges. Bots purchase again, and more fees. And so on, til these bots decide to sell everything, take their profits, and drive people to rekt city. 

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Hi lads,  
I stopped charting and looking up TA for a while. 
IMO              the manipulation is and was at such a high level that no chart was helpful. Anytime shorts built up, they'd pump it up 200-300 dollars. Longs would build up, they'd dump it (the exchanges themselves). So it was just a guessing game. 

Anyways, in the perfect world it'll make something like this. But since many others are betting on a similar chart... will the Market Makers allow it to happen? 
You be the judge, Good luck to all!

Hello my friends, 
Here we are with another  BTC -0.29%  Realtime,it's one month and half that with started this idea together and we will continue it to #666 and even more.lol.Again thanks all of you to make me proud of what i do.So let's look at our AMAZING  BTC -0.29%  chart.I want to name it ""iH&S WARZ"" . haahaa 
I'm so excited to show you what i wait for it for month,but first let's check history together,not so long,few month ago. 






In last FEB and MARCH many people thought bear market is near to end,and they had an iH&S that believed it can help to market back to bull market(chart above).Magic Poop was first person that started this idea and because of it i named that failed iH&S ,Poop iH&S.As you remember or see here that pattern failed,nt because of no proper and fit  volume profile  or anything else,just because it was too early to finish  btc -0.29%  correction.That was just start of bear market.After that market continued to move in cycle and print lower highs,that i still believe we formed a  bullish wedge  with that price actions.Till we reach this point.After a long downward from 10k we reached an almost new low and after that we started a new wave that can't name it new upward yet and can be just a retrace.But what is important is we brok that  downward channel  and 4 important resistance and we prove some supports,too.Let's look at this achievements from last  BTC -0.29%  Realtime again. 






As you can see we have a new and fresh channel here and it made on a strong  RSI  level that prove itself till now.We have  ichimoku  that broke and we are above it in a good mood.But what can change our retrace phase to a different phase?What can show us that we are in new bull market?Reversal signs. 
As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.29%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money. 
Thanks again to read my new  BTC -0.29%  Realtime,Thanks all of you to made this topic alive till now.Please give it a like if you like it,Believe me it's really make me happy.Leave a comment bellow to show me what you think.

IMO 1.06%  the manipulation is and was at such a high level that no chart was helpful. Anytime shorts built up, they'd pump it up 200-300 dollars. Longs would build up, they'd dump it (the exchanges themselves). So it was just a guessing game. 

Anyways, in the perfect world it'll make something like this. But since many others are betting on a similar chart... will the Market Makers allow it to happen? 
You be the judge, Good luck to all!

Hello my friends, 
Here we are with another  BTC -0.30%  Realtime,it's one month and half that with started this idea together and we will continue it to #666 and even more.lol.Again thanks all of you to make me proud of what i do.So let's look at our AMAZING  BTC -0.30%  chart.I want to name it ""iH&S WARZ"" . haahaa 
I'm so excited to show you what i wait for it for month,but first let's check history together,not so long,few month ago. 






In last FEB and MARCH many people thought bear market is near to end,and they had an iH&S that believed it can help to market back to bull market(chart above).Magic Poop was first person that started this idea and because of it i named that failed iH&S ,Poop iH&S.As you remember or see here that pattern failed,nt because of no proper and fit  volume profile  or anything else,just because it was too early to finish  btc -0.30%  correction.That was just start of bear market.After that market continued to move in cycle and print lower highs,that i still believe we formed a  bullish wedge  with that price actions.Till we reach this point.After a long downward from 10k we reached an almost new low and after that we started a new wave that can't name it new upward yet and can be just a retrace.But what is important is we brok that  downward channel  and 4 important resistance and we prove some supports,too.Let's look at this achievements from last  BTC -0.30%  Realtime again. 






As you can see we have a new and fresh channel here and it made on a strong  RSI  level that prove itself till now.We have  ichimoku  that broke and we are above it in a good mood.But what can change our retrace phase to a different phase?What can show us that we are in new bull market?Reversal signs. 
As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.30%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money. 
Thanks again to read my new  BTC -0.30%  Realtime,Thanks all of you to made this topic alive till now.Please give it a like if you like it,Believe me it's really make me happy.Leave a comment bellow to show me what you think.

Guys, I decided not to trade. I’m really angry with  BTC -0.30% . In fact, not with  BTC -0.30%  but with bots and exchanges allowing bots to work because of the huge amount of money they earn with fees. 
Bots buy, exchanges earn fees, people get in, more fees. The movement suddenly stops, people sell, more fees for the exchanges. Bots purchase again, and more fees. And so on, til these bots decide to sell everything, take their profits, and drive people to rekt city. 

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Guys, I decided not to trade. I’m really angry with  BTC -0.37% . In fact, not with  BTC -0.37%  but with bots and exchanges allowing bots to work because of the huge amount of money they earn with fees. 
Bots buy, exchanges earn fees, people get in, more fees. The movement suddenly stops, people sell, more fees for the exchanges. Bots purchase again, and more fees. And so on, til these bots decide to sell everything, take their profits, and drive people to rekt city. 

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Hi lads,  
I stopped charting and looking up TA for a while. 
IMO 1.06%  the manipulation is and was at such a high level that no chart was helpful. Anytime shorts built up, they'd pump it up 200-300 dollars. Longs would build up, they'd dump it (the exchanges themselves). So it was just a guessing game. 

Anyways, in the perfect world it'll make something like this. But since many others are betting on a similar chart... will the Market Makers allow it to happen? 
You be the judge, Good luck to all!

Hello my friends, 
Here we are with another  BTC -0.37%  Realtime,it's one month and half that with started this idea together and we will continue it to #666 and even more.lol.Again thanks all of you to make me proud of what i do.So let's look at our AMAZING  BTC -0.37%  chart.I want to name it ""iH&S WARZ"" . haahaa 
I'm so excited to show you what i wait for it for month,but first let's check history together,not so long,few month ago. 






In last FEB and MARCH many people thought bear market is near to end,and they had an iH&S that believed it can help to market back to bull market(chart above).Magic Poop was first person that started this idea and because of it i named that failed iH&S ,Poop iH&S.As you remember or see here that pattern failed,nt because of no proper and fit  volume profile  or anything else,just because it was too early to finish  btc -0.37%  correction.That was just start of bear market.After that market continued to move in cycle and print lower highs,that i still believe we formed a  bullish wedge  with that price actions.Till we reach this point.After a long downward from 10k we reached an almost new low and after that we started a new wave that can't name it new upward yet and can be just a retrace.But what is important is we brok that  downward channel  and 4 important resistance and we prove some supports,too.Let's look at this achievements from last  BTC -0.37%  Realtime again. 






As you can see we have a new and fresh channel here and it made on a strong  RSI  level that prove itself till now.We have  ichimoku  that broke and we are above it in a good mood.But what can change our retrace phase to a different phase?What can show us that we are in new bull market?Reversal signs. 
As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.37%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money. 
Thanks again to read my new  BTC -0.37%  Realtime,Thanks all of you to made this topic alive till now.Please give it a like if you like it,Believe me it's really make me happy.Leave a comment bellow to show me what you think.

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Hi lads,  
I stopped charting and looking up TA for a while. 
IMO 1.06%  the manipulation is and was at such a high level that no chart was helpful. Anytime shorts built up, they'd pump it up 200-300 dollars. Longs would build up, they'd dump it (the exchanges themselves). So it was just a guessing game. 

Anyways, in the perfect world it'll make something like this. But since many others are betting on a similar chart... will the Market Makers allow it to happen? 
You be the judge, Good luck to all!

Hello my friends, 
Here we are with another  BTC -0.30%  Realtime,it's one month and half that with started this idea together and we will continue it to #666 and even more.lol.Again thanks all of you to make me proud of what i do.So let's look at our AMAZING  BTC -0.30%  chart.I want to name it ""iH&S WARZ"" . haahaa 
I'm so excited to show you what i wait for it for month,but first let's check history together,not so long,few month ago. 






In last FEB and MARCH many people thought bear market is near to end,and they had an iH&S that believed it can help to market back to bull market(chart above).Magic Poop was first person that started this idea and because of it i named that failed iH&S ,Poop iH&S.As you remember or see here that pattern failed,nt because of no proper and fit  volume profile  or anything else,just because it was too early to finish  btc -0.30%  correction.That was just start of bear market.After that market continued to move in cycle and print lower highs,that i still believe we formed a  bullish wedge  with that price actions.Till we reach this point.After a long downward from 10k we reached an almost new low and after that we started a new wave that can't name it new upward yet and can be just a retrace.But what is important is we brok that  downward channel  and 4 important resistance and we prove some supports,too.Let's look at this achievements from last  BTC -0.30%  Realtime again. 






As you can see we have a new and fresh channel here and it made on a strong  RSI  level that prove itself till now.We have  ichimoku  that broke and we are above it in a good mood.But what can change our retrace phase to a different phase?What can show us that we are in new bull market?Reversal signs. 
As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.30%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money. 
Thanks again to read my new  BTC -0.30%  Realtime,Thanks all of you to made this topic alive till now.Please give it a like if you like it,Believe me it's really make me happy.Leave a comment bellow to show me what you think.

Guys, I decided not to trade. I’m really angry with  BTC -0.39% . In fact, not with  BTC -0.39%  but with bots and exchanges allowing bots to work because of the huge amount of money they earn with fees. 
Bots buy, exchanges earn fees, people get in, more fees. The movement suddenly stops, people sell, more fees for the exchanges. Bots purchase again, and more fees. And so on, til these bots decide to sell everything, take their profits, and drive people to rekt city. 

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Hi lads,  
I stopped charting and looking up TA for a while. 
IMO 1.06%  the manipulation is and was at such a high level that no chart was helpful. Anytime shorts built up, they'd pump it up 200-300 dollars. Longs would build up, they'd dump it (the exchanges themselves). So it was just a guessing game. 

Anyways, in the perfect world it'll make something like this. But since many others are betting on a similar chart... will the Market Makers allow it to happen? 
You be the judge, Good luck to all!

1531041226.0,Peymana71,BTC Realtime Analyse #6,"
Hello my friends, 
Here we are with another  BTC -0.39%  Realtime,it's one month and half that with started this idea together and we will continue it to #666 and even more.lol.Again thanks all of you to make me proud of what i do.So let's look at our AMAZING  BTC -0.39%  chart.I want to name it ""iH&S WARZ"" . haahaa 
I'm so excited to show you what i wait for it for month,but first let's check history together,not so long,few month ago. 






In last FEB and MARCH many people thought bear market is near to end,and they had an iH&S that believed it can help to market back to bull market(chart above).Magic Poop was first person that started this idea and because of it i named that failed iH&S ,Poop iH&S.As you remember or see here that pattern failed,nt because of no proper and fit  volume profile  or anything else,just because it was too early to finish  btc -0.39%  correction.That was just start of bear market.After that market continued to move in cycle and print lower highs,that i still believe we formed a  bullish wedge  with that price actions.Till we reach this point.After a long downward from 10k we reached an almost new low and after that we started a new wave that can't name it new upward yet and can be just a retrace.But what is important is we brok that  downward channel  and 4 important resistance and we prove some supports,too.Let's look at this achievements from last  BTC -0.39%  Realtime again. 






As you can see we have a new and fresh channel here and it made on a strong  RSI  level that prove itself till now.We have  ichimoku  that broke and we are above it in a good mood.But what can change our retrace phase to a different phase?What can show us that we are in new bull market?Reversal signs. 
As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.39%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money.

Guys, I decided not to trade. I’m really angry with  BTC -0.36% . In fact, not with  BTC -0.36%  but with bots and exchanges allowing bots to work because of the huge amount of money they earn with fees. 
Bots buy, exchanges earn fees, people get in, more fees. The movement suddenly stops, people sell, more fees for the exchanges. Bots purchase again, and more fees. And so on, til these bots decide to sell everything, take their profits, and drive people to rekt city. 

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Hi lads,  
I stopped charting and looking up TA for a while. 
IMO 1.06%  the manipulation is and was at such a high level that no chart was helpful. Anytime shorts built up, they'd pump it up 200-300 dollars. Longs would build up, they'd dump it (the exchanges themselves). So it was just a guessing game. 

Anyways, in the perfect world it'll make something like this. But since many others are betting on a similar chart... will the Market Makers allow it to happen?

Hello my friends, 
Here we are with another  BTC -0.35%  Realtime,it's one month and half that with started this idea together and we will continue it to #666 and even more.lol.Again thanks all of you to make me proud of what i do.So let's look at our AMAZING  BTC -0.35%  chart.I want to name it ""iH&S WARZ"" . haahaa 
I'm so excited to show you what i wait for it for month,but first let's check history together,not so long,few month ago. 






In last FEB and MARCH many people thought bear market is near to end,and they had an iH&S that believed it can help to market back to bull market(chart above).Magic Poop was first person that started this idea and because of it i named that failed iH&S ,Poop iH&S.As you remember or see here that pattern failed,nt because of no proper and fit  volume profile  or anything else,just because it was too early to finish  btc -0.35%  correction.That was just start of bear market.After that market continued to move in cycle and print lower highs,that i still believe we formed a  bullish wedge  with that price actions.Till we reach this point.After a long downward from 10k we reached an almost new low and after that we started a new wave that can't name it new upward yet and can be just a retrace.But what is important is we brok that  downward channel  and 4 important resistance and we prove some supports,too.Let's look at this achievements from last  BTC -0.35%  Realtime again. 






As you can see we have a new and fresh channel here and it made on a strong  RSI  level that prove itself till now.We have  ichimoku  that broke and we are above it in a good mood.But what can change our retrace phase to a different phase?What can show us that we are in new bull market?Reversal signs. 
As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.35%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money. 
Thanks again to read my new  BTC -0.35%  Realtime,Thanks all of you to made this topic alive till now.Please give it a like if you like it,Believe me it's really make me happy.Leave a comment bellow to show me what you think.

As you see in main chart of this idea we have 3 iH&S in 3 sizes that help each other to forme perfect.Look at thease baby boys. 






This is first one that i mentioned it in last  BTC -0.33%  Realtime analyse and we are testing its neckline now,remember it can drop more to make a balance right shoulder and test last suppoer and broken  downward channel  again. 






After that we have a bigger brother that trying to shape its head. Shaping this head will end with last iH&S confirmation and our big  bullish wedge (dotted line from 20k) result.After that we will test that  wedge  as a support and shape right shoulder of this iH&S. 






And finnaly we have a Beast here.biggest brother that can end bear market and prove all scenario .We have similar requirements for this iH&S,like second one.Now we have little proofs for this one and it's really soon to judge on it but all these show us that we are in different situation from when we had PooP IH&S.Market tried hard to print a new bottom but they couldn't achieve that,now bears are so tired but bulls are little lazy too.Look at another reversal sign now. 






Adam & Eve  double bottom ,i mentioned it in last week analyse and really can't ignore it. 
So let's see what we have now: 
Reversal Signs 
1. 2 Long-Term  Bullish Wedge 
2. 3 iH&S in 3 size 
3. ADAM & EVE  double bottom 
4. Reach to 78.60%  Fibonacci Retracement 
These are great signs and we need just new money and trust in market to start a new parabolic move in next DEC,Don't forget that all these  acn -0.18%  burn and turn to trash without enough interest in market.We need New Money,not manipulators money,Investors money. 
Thanks again to read my new  BTC -0.33%  Realtime,Thanks all of you to made this topic alive till now.Please give it a like if you like it,Believe me it's really make me happy.Leave a comment bellow to show me what you think.

Guys, I decided not to trade. I’m really angry with  BTC             . In fact, not with  BTC              but with bots and exchanges allowing bots to work because of the huge amount of money they earn with fees. 
Bots buy, exchanges earn fees, people get in, more fees. The movement suddenly stops, people sell, more fees for the exchanges. Bots purchase again, and more fees. And so on, til these bots decide to sell everything, take their profits, and drive people to rekt city. 

Look at the indicator I have and see how yellow arrow points at this weird movement. While the pink arrow shows a smooth movement, the other one goes up aggressively. But that’s not all. Look at the price. One single big dildo and suddenly... nothing happens. This is more about gambling at the moment, so I would stay away. 
It is not only me saying there are a lot of bots manipulating it, and you know? I’m starting to get tired. You can’t anticipate these aggressive movements, and who knows if you get in and it stops there.

Hi lads,  
I stopped charting and looking up TA for a while. 
IMO 1.06%  the manipulation is and was at such a high level that no chart was helpful. Anytime shorts built up, they'd pump it up 200-300 dollars. Longs would build up, they'd dump it (the exchanges themselves). So it was just a guessing game. 

Anyways, in the perfect world it'll make something like this. But since many others are betting on a similar chart... will the Market Makers allow it to happen? 
You be the judge, Good luck to all!

 Elliot wave  is about to form wave 3, which is certainly the biggest wave of a cycle.  
Also, the  RSI  is on an all-time-low!  
We just recently touched the lowest of the  bollinger  bands!  
MACD  is in a  bearish  sentiment but the lines are about to cross to shift  bullish  again!  
The histogram looks like it completed a cycle, too.  

Is this the time to be very, very  bullish  for the next 12 months?  
We might go further down but there is not much room to the downside before we explode to the upside!

If the counting is correct and we are in a new impulsive wave 1, then the targets we are seen (not currently on chart) are above 8k! We are hesitant to accept the current wave as C, as it had gone too far, above the 1.618 fib... 

Like and follow!  
Comment if you see things differently!
