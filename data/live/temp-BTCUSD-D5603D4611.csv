Comment:
					Its very difficult to say exactly where we are comoared to 2014. If i take different reference points it looks different. All i know is that we are very close to the bottom. Doesnt mean BTC cant fall another 30- 50%.

Not much new under the Sun, where will  BTC -0.78%  go?  
When will bear market end?  
CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKET is one of the most exciting markets in the whole world, I think.  
In 2016, it took almost 2 years until the market turns into  bullish  again.  
Not sure this time how long it will take, back then there was no 1:100 leverage or usdt ""scam"", if we consider all of the factors that can affect the market, it would be difficult to predict.  
I have few predictions about the time.  
1. This year August to Septermber, pretty much every year Septermber is very active, money might flow in.  
2. 2019 Jan, each year the begging, after Christmas and new year, new investors will join this game again.  
3. If the economy is very bad, no new money join in, then this market might won't recover for a very long time.  
Like it's dead....  
but we can always looking forward for 7 years, it's long enough to recover pretty much every market.

We have a valid WXY corrective pattern at wave four, which prints a low wick at .382 ret of wave 3. 
Anticipating a break of resistance  trendline  for wave 5.  

If the position comes into fruition, SL should be placed below the assumed end of wave 4.

1530473667.0,thebeesknees11235,BTC/USD Monthly; 30 min,"
To hone in on the overall pattern for FY 2018, I pulled a monthly snapshot with 30 minute increments to further highlight my projection of BTC/USD rather than a yearly ""overall"" to convey how  BTC -0.88%  is being deflated one semi-drastic price action at a time when high  volume  hits various exchanges. 
I formulated my own fib levels with units of ""100.00"" rather than using the tool Trading View provides. The number sequence of 0,1,1,2,3,5 along with directional arrows are provided, such that, onlookers may easily understand how I calculated resistance and support for the monthly chart provided by Trading View.  Of interest, is the ascending range #3, the descending range #3, and the descending range #5 of price action(s).  A more detailed analysis can and should be overlapped onto the very basic monthly chart given; however, the chart shows the overall pattern of deflation of the speculative bubble in FY 2018 within a shorter segment; a month. 
It is my opinion that if this trend continues, Crypto-currencies in general are only good for swing trading, with the assumption that all factors remain mostly the same.   This is my sole opinion; a conjecture that is not to be misconstrued as Financial Advice, implied or otherwise.
