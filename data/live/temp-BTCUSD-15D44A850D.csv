1530934147.0,gtrox115,BTC Looks Bullish As It Eyes 7200!,"




31 minutes ago




Despite what some may think and say,  BTC -0.05%  is looking quite  bullish  right now! Looking first at the chart on the left, we can see that the 4 hour chart has formed another  bull flag  below the 200  ema , coming off a smaller  bull flag  below the 100  ema . The  MACD  has formed a new  uptrend channel  and is rounding up at the midline, the  RSI  is strongly bullishly diverging into a  falling wedge , the  Awesome Oscillator  has crossed into a buy signal, and the Laguerre  PPO  has moved down from the oversold region and is curving back up. 
I'm trying to show two things on the chart on the right. The first is the significance of breaking and finding support on the 4 hour 100  ema . Each failed attempt to breach the  ema  is shown with a red box, and it has trapped us in a downtrend since we fell from 10k back in May. Above us we still face the 200  ema , but as I said above, we are in a nice  bull flag  finding support on that  ema  which was previously such a strong resistance. The second thing I'd like to point out on the right side chart is the 4 hour  ichimoku cloud . This is our third attempt at a  bullish  Tenkan-Kijun Cross (TKx). The first try was flat out rejected, with price failing to even touch the cloud; the second try resulted in a successful TKx, but the Tenkan line (blue) flatlined after and price failed to break above the cloud, resulting in a  bearish  cross and a drop back down. We've now had a successful cross, with the Tenkan continuing to move up from the Kijun line (red), and, most importantly, price has moved above the cloud, with the cloud turning green tomorrow.  
Overall, we've got some huge  bullish  signals quietly revealing themselves on the  BTC -0.05%  chart. Remember, it is at times like this, when sentiment is incredibly  bearish  and everyone is crying out ""bitcoin is dead,"" that  bitcoin -0.05%  reverses and goes  bullish . Be careful of fakeouts and bear traps, like I believe the  head and shoulders  pattern it is forming is.  
Now, my trade setup right now: 
I'll be entering after the 4 hour closes a candle through the 200  ema  at 6710. My stop losses will be half upon failure to find support on the 200  ema , and the other half upon a close below the 100  ema . My targets for the trade are 6900, 7200, 7450, and 7800. Remember, this is my personal trade setup which I am sharing for educational and informational purposes only. You make your own trade decisions and are responsible for the outcome, no matter what I or anyone else on tradingview says.

					Also, sorry the chart on the right is so hard to see, I forgot to remove the indicators from the chart before posting. If you pull each one down and then zoom and scroll, its a lot easier to see what I'm talking about!

this is assuming we break the  head and shoulders  we're currently in, which in itself would make sense. 

head in shoulders into a bigger inverse head and shoulders? 

Sure, why not!  
I'm in a long currently but i'll get over it

1530927785.0,CastAwayTrader,BTC - retest of the previous low can be a good LONG entry,"
I slightly changed my micro count. I think the low for the subwave (  iii 0.18%  ) is in. And we are in a corrective wave ( iv ) up. 
But because subwave ( ii ) was shallow and shaped as a simple  zig-zag , I think we should expect a higher pullbnack in the current wave ( iv ) up. 
This current pullback shaped as a-b-c up I count as only the first leg of the pullback, subwave a of the wave ( iv ) up. 
Then coming drop to the recent lows will be counted as b of ( iv ) and such drop should set a stage for an impulsive looking rally in subwave c of the wave ( iv ) up. 
For the wave ( v ) down the minimum target will be 4,591. 
The reason for that is that we are working on the larger wave ( c ) of ( v ) of C of . 
Normally wave ( c ) of ( v ) extends at least to 100% of ( a ) of ( v ) which stands at 4,591.

The lack of  volatility  and volumes is becoming a problem to keep a bull trend. Bull momentum is ded and every resistances are becoming harder to break. 

I expect a rejection in a near term of a resistance maybe 7.2 or lower 

Bitcoin -0.05%  is gonna fall slowly until Septembre, a potential panic could occur and give a wick to 3K with a brutal V bottom. 
Btc -0.05%  should retest longterm TL in white. 
The exit dump with a vertical run up should be a signal for important  volatility  back, that could push investors to buy, with the idea that  btc -0.05%  bottomed and potentiel huge profits to make. 

A lot of instutionals are ready to jump but  imo 1.06%  they expects more dump to enter or needs time to prepare the entry (etfs, laws,...) 

So i think there is an interesting swing to do. 
Starting to short in a near term a rejection that will occur, to the final bottom (enjoy holidays) 
Waiting a brutal crash and starting to go long between 4.7 and 3k until new  ATH 1.15%  ( 30K) and take profit 

BULL SIGNALS TO WATCH: 

Volatility  ( see the stdev, we bottomed, but it can take time before  volatility  comes back, investors wont enter without  volatility , useless to bet money on something that doesnt move) 
Fresh money ( Funds, Etfs) 
Lightening ( a possible dump could happen, because it will decrease income of miners for a short period )

Here are two possible scenarios.  

I expect a pullback before a dedicated move. There is hidden  bearish div 0.71%  waiting to play out. Weekly looks like a temp bounce so the green trace seems more likely. 

Looks like we could either pull back, channel and pump or straight dump.  

Dates I'm looking out for: today (7/7),  9th 11.82% , 13th, 19th and 27th. 

I'm slowly scaling into a short for a multiple day hold.

					That 6600 to 6750 zone for me is a great short opportunity. It can go all the way to sub 6k from there and risk/reward pretty high, since bitcoin only need to test 6900 with high volume and close above to break that support .

Traders,  

Technically, on weekly chart,  BTC -0.05%  has a chance to retest 9k in few weeks. 

That could take 3-4 weeks to finish. 

The  broken trendline  with triple bottom is telling us these. 

Less is more!

Smart Money:  BTC -0.05%  Selling Last Support Strategy â€“ SHORT 

- Forming potential  head and shoulders  pattern. 
- High/Higher High/Lower High =  Bearish . 
- If 3 tests of the 6420 purple support line. Short on a bounce off the retest of 6420 as resistance. Close at 6280-6300.  
- If there is a bounce then this is the third test of the 6280 identified via the red arrows. Wait for a drop and completion of the retest and short off resistance at 6280 and close at 6100.

					If this plays out long long long off 6100 as it could then form an inverse head and shoulders.

This might sound a little different from the general TA, but it has actually worked in the past, and it works in the forex too, I'm talking about  EMA  5 and  EMA  12 Cross Over. White line in the chart shows  EMA  5 and Sky Blue Line Shows  EMA  12, On the chart Green Circles point out to all the times when 5  EMA  Cross Over 12  EMA . Red Circles Shows when it Crossed Down 12  EMA , Light Brown Circle Shows when 12  EMA  acted as resistance against 5  EMA  and price went below, Blue Circle Shows When 12  EMA  acted as support for 5  EMA . Trade Safe guys, I'm a new trader learning things thought I should share it. Thank  you!
