XRP stay above .43  in order to break out the channel at .46 and head to  the target of .70






an hour ago





Comment:
					XRP has been in this channel since April 20th, so breaking past the channel wall  indicates XRP is serious about moving upwards to higher pastures.  Amen,

Major support for XRP.If  bitcoin -0.01%  goes down 500$ or more,ripple is moving towards 0.30 area and 0.20 further.May be a great buy in case bitocin moves up 1k points now,risky trade. 
We are in a strong downtrend,untill the king stabilizes,alts are doing minor pumps and get down as fast.

I am a writer and full-time entrepreneur in addition to trading crypto.  One of the benefits in following a market that never closes - is that huge chunks of time in between trades are mine to do what I want with.  Many of my businesses require the occasional bout of ""hands on"" management - usually this doesn't take a lot of time and  I am able to  focus on both my love of writing and crypto. 

Ripple is a project I have been following from a very early stage.  Many people have dismissed it as ""just another  bitcoin -0.02%  knockoff"" which really does no justice to the project.   Crypto has reached the point where direct involvement in a business such as starting your own crypto project - requires immense risk and funding.   The easiest way to participate in Crypto as an individual investor is to buy the asset directly.   Cloud mining and other forms of paid forms of coin accumulation is almost always a loosing proposition.   Most financial advisers will dedicate 5% of a portfolio's value for higher risk investments.  Ripple as a 17 billion dollar currency is no more risky than investing in mining or some other industry that experiences wild fluctuations.  There is some possible downside - but the upside of investing in this new asset class before the rest of the world catches on - makes the reward well worth the risk. 

XRP is more or less following the pattern of  BTC -0.02% .   BTC -0.02%  continues to move sideways in what is looking to either be a left shoulder or a possible  double bottom .  XRP has similar properties.  When XRP picks a direction after we finish moving sideways - we are either retracing back to .43 before reversing - or we build a head after breaking through .50.   People hate analysts who give them too many options.  The advice is the same in both situations.  If we move down its only a temporary situation before we move back to .50.  If we hit .43 again - take another position.  If we go right to .50 - wait for confirmation of the pattern before we can determine how to play things in the short term. 

Yesterday was a nice break from the  bearish  momentum we've seen lately.   XRP need to break through .50 to move forward - lets hope  BTC -0.02%  stops its sideways momentum, breaks through 6400 and moves to challenge 6800.  If this happens we will see an >.50 XRP in the very near future. 

XRP is still a buy - there is lots of upside for this coin - especially considering it has a recognized project with actual merit.  Short positions are not recommended during the weekend but especially with a chart like today - we can postulate that  BTC -0.02%  will break the 6400 mark and we will head upward - but there is also a real possibility of the price continuing to be rejected and indirectly holding XRP down. 

I personally am still taking positions at this level.  Genius sees what other's don't - weak hands are giving away their XRP ""for a song"" - if you came to the conclusion that XRP was a good investment 6 months ago - it should still be a great investment today.   Many people seem to be abandoning ship - but just as we have seen in previous markets - many of these same people will end up piling back in when we enter our next bull run.
