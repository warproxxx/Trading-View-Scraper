Comment:
					Keep in mind that this works only if Wave is V is aborted aka Flat or double bottom. 

This rally is good but we are still in bear, but close to getting the fuck out of it. 

We need more bank turmoils, and stock have to finally give way as FED tightening their positions. Basically FED is doing their best to stall stock rally via interest rate increase and tightening on loads and access to dollars.

1530383013.0,G0ldenross,ETH looks Good for me,"
Maybe it will have a good July,  BTC 1.94%  say it so too,  RSI  is below 40 level, but at the bottom so, perhaps it will have a spike for next month, as most of the market. 

First it will need to show some buy pressure and good  volume  to break the resistances.

1530382718.0,tx512,Back to ETH 390$ early July,"
ETH logically moved up during the last hours while stayed within the descending  wedge 
Since May ETH used to drop each time it gets close to the upper part of the descending  wedge  which is now more or less the equivalent of the  EMA  10day  
Same behavior when the  RSI  comes close the the line you can see on the graph. 
ETH drops again when the above mentioned situations happen together with a moment of low volumes.   
 
So, if early July, ETH is close to the upper part of the  wedge , with a  RSI  close to the line I made, with low volumes, I will probably short ETH with a target price at 400$-390$.
