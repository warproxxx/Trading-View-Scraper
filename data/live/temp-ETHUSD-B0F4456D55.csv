The  Ethereum -0.34%  rate came out of flat and went upwards. 
Priority of the day: the growth of the  ETHUSD -0.34%  rate to $ 504. 
Buyers were able to keep the price of  Ethereum -0.34%  above $ 460, and spoiled all attempts of sellers to reduce it. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD -0.34%  rate will rise from $ 477 to $ 504. 
2. The rate of  ETHUSD -0.34%  may be in flat. 
Alternative scenario: 
Now the backup plan is a drop in the rate of  Ethereum -0.34%  to $ 460.

1531031657.0,icexch,Ethereum has been drifting waiting for wind of change,"
n last review we wrote about the balance of  supply and demand  near $ 500. Since that the rate has declined a bit. However, under $ 500 there is a demand and it seems to exceed supply. At least now.  
So, equilibrium price has been found for current market conditions. Ether has started to drift and it has been fluctuating under influence of casual wind gusts. To move further there is a need for stronger and sustainable wind: changes of market conditions. The change of market participants behavior is needed. Studying the history of last year we can suggest that this drift will continue till autumn. Moving averages will cross. The fluctuations will fade near them. Only then the wind of changes will fill sagging sails of the ship with a proud name Ether. And it will continue its way. To further blossom or to dusk the time will tell. And our reviews too, of course:)

1531003536.0,MarcPMarkets,ETHUSD: Triangle Points To Strength. Noise Offers Better Entry.,"
 ETHUSD -0.34%  update: As price consolidates, the formation that is unfolding signals further strength. A break above 476 and this market will be facing the 494 to 518 minor  resistance zone . Obviously a break out in  BTC -0.48%  is key. We are more interested in any retest of lower prices for either a failed breakout or higher low scenario. 

Triangles are typically trend continuation patterns. The standard buying of breakouts during these formations is not a bad idea if you are feeling aggressive. At S.C., we have been long term  bullish  for months but it is not in our plan to be aggressively  bullish  on the short term. 

We anticipate high probability opportunities IF this market, along with  BTC -0.48% , offers any retest of lower prices. This can unfold in the form of a failed range breakout on the  bearish  side, or a higher low structure around the 423 reversal zone boundary. 

We choose this more conservative stance because the 571  resistance level  is still intact. This is the .382 resistance of the recent  bearish  structure relative to the 838 high. It helps us determine if a broader  bullish  movement is in progress or not.  

Since it is not, yet, the short term is more likely to be in a larger range bound environment. Like I have written numerous times, bottoms are a process and that process offers plenty of entry opportunities if you know what they look like.  

In summary, there is nothing wrong with taking a  bullish  break out if the next leg higher unfolds. We will not call it as a trade because it is better managed as a day trade in light of the risk and speed of change in this market. 

We navigate these markets according to the criteria set forth by our plan and so should you with yours. We also have to consider risk in light of the fact that our choices can also affect the actions of our followers which is why we lean more to the conservative side. 

As the short term price action transitions back to  bullish , there will be a lot of noise. The most attractive opportunities will be the lows of this noisy range as long as a decisive new low is not established. Plan ahead for the possibilities and be prepared for those scenarios if they appear. If any swing trade opportunities present themselves, they will be shared with our followers.
