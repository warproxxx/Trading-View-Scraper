Ripple follows its rivals and develops a downside correction as the price loses almost four percent in the past 24 hours. However, XRP/USD still looks  bullish  and able to resume its uptrend in the nearest future.  
 XRP/USD worked its  bullish Flag  on Tuesday unlike other cryptos. However, after reaching the  resistance area  at $0.5088, Ripple failed to jump over it and retreated from this area. XRP/USD declined towards the  support area  at $0.4744 and reached it later. We have a  Doji candlestick , which means that Ripple is able to resume growth in the nearest future. 
What are the targets for today? If bulls are successful close to this  support area  at $0.4744, they will be able to drive XRP/USD higher targeting the next resistance at $0.5088. Is this the final point for growth for the next 24 hours? We think that no, it is not and buyers will be able to drive XRP/USD even higher. 
This is the main scenario for Ripple. However, if sellers gain momentum, they will be able to develop this downside correction towards the next support at $0.4495.
