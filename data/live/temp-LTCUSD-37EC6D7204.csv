S3  Camarilla  reversal and other good stuff. Initial TP at R3 then the top of the range near R4. Everything else before then is just a shakeout. I am considering shorting above $90-96 but its lack of  volatility  or any news makes it a bit slow paced compared to the new coins that don't work (although Litecoin has been abandoned so there's that) 

This is dependent on  bitcoin -0.39%  going sideways or up. 

Heavy  bearish  retracement from its price esplosion
