The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 1.26%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 1.26%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 1.26%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo              on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 1.26%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 1.26%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

1530305309.0,quasar35,vortex,"
The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy              With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it.

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 1.26%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 1.26%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 1.26%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo              on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 1.26%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 1.26%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy -4.00%  With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it.

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 1.26%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 1.26%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 1.26%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo              on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 1.26%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 1.26%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy              With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it.

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

 BTCUSD              is clearly in a bear market. It had broken the key  support level  at $6000. Our next target would be 5k followed by 3k. 3k would be a very strong support. But, if the major support is breached, we might expect a heavy selling to take place for  bitcoin              and this goes to confirm that the biggest bubble had been popped.

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 1.26%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 1.26%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo              on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 1.26%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 1.26%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy              With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it. 

I want to be  bullish , but I see nothing to support that thesis at the moment. Stay away until the tape suggests otherwise unless you like catching falling knives!

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

 BTCUSD 1.26%  is clearly in a bear market. It had broken the key  support level  at $6000. Our next target would be 5k followed by 3k. 3k would be a very strong support. But, if the major support is breached, we might expect a heavy selling to take place for  bitcoin 1.26%  and this goes to confirm that the biggest bubble had been popped. Let us just hope that it don't happen.

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy              With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it. 

I want to be  bullish , but I see nothing to support that thesis at the moment. Stay away until the tape suggests otherwise unless you like catching falling knives!

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

 BTCUSD 1.61%  is clearly in a bear market. It had broken the key  support level  at $6000. Our next target would be 5k followed by 3k. 3k would be a very strong support. But, if the major support is breached, we might expect a heavy selling to take place for  bitcoin 1.61%  and this goes to confirm that the biggest bubble had been popped.

My target from previous March wave count post remained: 
3-4k, or potentially overshoot below 3k on panic selling. 

Its a Looooong winter for  BTC 1.66% , but I'm very confident that the ensuing Wave5, which will resume previous incredible climb,

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 1.68%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 1.68%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 1.68%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo              on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.

Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy -4.00%  With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it. 

I want to be  bullish , but I see nothing to support that thesis at the moment. Stay away until the tape suggests otherwise unless you like catching falling knives!

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

 BTCUSD 1.68%  is clearly in a bear market. It had broken the key  support level  at $6000. Our next target would be 5k followed by 3k. 3k would be a very strong support. But, if the major support is breached, we might expect a heavy selling to take place for  bitcoin 1.68%  and this goes to confirm that the biggest bubble had been popped.

My target from previous March wave count post remained: 
3-4k, or potentially overshoot below 3k on panic selling.

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 1.68%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 1.68%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 1.68%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo 0.29%  on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 1.68%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 1.68%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here.

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security.

Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it. 

I want to be  bullish , but I see nothing to support that thesis at the moment. Stay away until the tape suggests otherwise unless you like catching falling knives!

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

 BTCUSD 1.66%  is clearly in a bear market. It had broken the key  support level  at $6000. Our next target would be 5k followed by 3k. 3k would be a very strong support. But, if the major support is breached, we might expect a heavy selling to take place for  bitcoin 1.66%  and this goes to confirm that the biggest bubble had been popped. Let us just hope that it don't happen.

My target from previous March wave count post remained: 
3-4k, or potentially overshoot below 3k on panic selling.

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 1.66%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 1.66%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 1.66%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo              on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 1.66%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 1.66%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy              With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security.

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

 BTCUSD 1.70%  is clearly in a bear market. It had broken the key  support level  at $6000. Our next target would be 5k followed by 3k. 3k would be a very strong support.

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 1.70%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 1.70%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 1.70%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo 0.29%  on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 1.70%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 1.70%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy -4.00%  With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 1.70%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 1.70%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 1.70%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo 0.29%  on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 1.70%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 1.70%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

1530305309.0,quasar35,vortex,"
The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy              With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it.

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 1.66%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 1.66%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 1.66%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo 0.29%  on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 1.66%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 1.66%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy              With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it.

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 1.66%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 1.66%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 1.66%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo              on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 1.66%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 1.66%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy              With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it.

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

 BTCUSD 1.66%  is clearly in a bear market. It had broken the key  support level  at $6000. Our next target would be 5k followed by 3k. 3k would be a very strong support. But, if the major support is breached, we might expect a heavy selling to take place for  bitcoin 1.66%  and this goes to confirm that the biggest bubble had been popped.

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy              With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it.

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

 BTCUSD 1.47%  is clearly in a bear market. It had broken the key  support level  at $6000. Our next target would be 5k followed by 3k. 3k would be a very strong support. But, if the major support is breached, we might expect a heavy selling to take place for  bitcoin 1.47%  and this goes to confirm that the biggest bubble had been popped.

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy              With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it. 

I want to be  bullish , but I see nothing to support that thesis at the moment. Stay away until the tape suggests otherwise unless you like catching falling knives!

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

 BTCUSD 1.52%  is clearly in a bear market. It had broken the key  support level  at $6000. Our next target would be 5k followed by 3k. 3k would be a very strong support. But, if the major support is breached, we might expect a heavy selling to take place for  bitcoin 1.52%  and this goes to confirm that the biggest bubble had been popped. Let us just hope that it don't happen.

After comparing different possible counts, I feel this is the closest possible scenario for next few month's  BTC 1.52%  moves. 

My target from previous March wave count post remained: 
3-4k, or potentially overshoot below 3k on panic selling. 

Its a Looooong winter for  BTC 1.52% , but I'm very confident that the ensuing Wave5, which will resume previous incredible climb,

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 1.52%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 1.52%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 1.52%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo              on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY              index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 1.52%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 1.52%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it. 

I want to be  bullish , but I see nothing to support that thesis at the moment. Stay away until the tape suggests otherwise unless you like catching falling knives!

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

 BTCUSD 1.49%  is clearly in a bear market. It had broken the key  support level  at $6000. Our next target would be 5k followed by 3k. 3k would be a very strong support. But, if the major support is breached, we might expect a heavy selling to take place for  bitcoin 1.49%  and this goes to confirm that the biggest bubble had been popped.

My target from previous March wave count post remained: 
3-4k, or potentially overshoot below 3k on panic selling. 

Its a Looooong winter for  BTC 1.49% , but I'm very confident that the ensuing Wave5, which will resume previous incredible climb,

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 1.53%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 1.53%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 1.53%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo              on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 1.53%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 1.53%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy              With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools.

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it. 

I want to be  bullish , but I see nothing to support that thesis at the moment. Stay away until the tape suggests otherwise unless you like catching falling knives!

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

 BTCUSD 1.61%  is clearly in a bear market. It had broken the key  support level  at $6000. Our next target would be 5k followed by 3k. 3k would be a very strong support. But, if the major support is breached, we might expect a heavy selling to take place for  bitcoin 1.61%  and this goes to confirm that the biggest bubble had been popped.

My target from previous March wave count post remained: 
3-4k, or potentially overshoot below 3k on panic selling.

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 1.61%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 1.61%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 1.61%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo 0.29%  on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 1.61%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 1.61%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

1530305309.0,quasar35,vortex,"
The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy              With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

But, if the major support is breached, we might expect a heavy selling to take place for  bitcoin 1.64%  and this goes to confirm that the biggest bubble had been popped.

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 1.70%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 1.70%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 1.70%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo              on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 1.70%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 1.70%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

1530305309.0,quasar35,vortex,"
The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy              With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it.

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 2.26%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 2.26%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 2.26%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo 0.29%  on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 2.26%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 2.26%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy -4.00%  With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it.

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

1. Look for some  bullish  relief around 5200-5300 on the daily. The 1.0 fib exts of 6/7-6/19 & 6/20-6/25 are showing confluence, so look for a reversal there. 

2. For the larger trend, the 1.0 fib exts on both the W & the D charts are showing confluence in the 4800-4900 area, indicating a reversal area.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 2.32%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 2.32%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 2.32%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo              on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 2.32%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 2.32%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy              With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it.

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

 BTCUSD 2.32%  is clearly in a bear market. It had broken the key  support level  at $6000. Our next target would be 5k followed by 3k. 3k would be a very strong support. But, if the major support is breached, we might expect a heavy selling to take place for  bitcoin 2.32%  and this goes to confirm that the biggest bubble had been popped.

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 2.32%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 2.32%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 2.32%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo 0.29%  on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 2.32%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 2.32%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy -4.00%  With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it. 

I want to be  bullish , but I see nothing to support that thesis at the moment. Stay away until the tape suggests otherwise unless you like catching falling knives!

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

 BTCUSD 2.32%  is clearly in a bear market. It had broken the key  support level  at $6000. Our next target would be 5k followed by 3k. 3k would be a very strong support. But, if the major support is breached, we might expect a heavy selling to take place for  bitcoin 2.32%  and this goes to confirm that the biggest bubble had been popped.

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy              With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it. 

I want to be  bullish , but I see nothing to support that thesis at the moment. Stay away until the tape suggests otherwise unless you like catching falling knives!

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

 BTCUSD 3.73%  is clearly in a bear market. It had broken the key  support level  at $6000. Our next target would be 5k followed by 3k. 3k would be a very strong support. But, if the major support is breached, we might expect a heavy selling to take place for  bitcoin 3.73%  and this goes to confirm that the biggest bubble had been popped.

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 4.20%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 4.20%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 4.20%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo              on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.

Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy              With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it. 

I want to be  bullish , but I see nothing to support that thesis at the moment. Stay away until the tape suggests otherwise unless you like catching falling knives!

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

 BTCUSD 5.97%  is clearly in a bear market. It had broken the key  support level  at $6000. Our next target would be 5k followed by 3k. 3k would be a very strong support. But, if the major support is breached, we might expect a heavy selling to take place for  bitcoin 5.97%  and this goes to confirm that the biggest bubble had been popped. Let us just hope that it don't happen.

My target from previous March wave count post remained:

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 5.63%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 5.63%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 5.63%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo 0.29%  on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 5.63%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 5.63%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods.

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it.

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

 BTCUSD 6.22%  is clearly in a bear market. It had broken the key  support level  at $6000. Our next target would be 5k followed by 3k. 3k would be a very strong support. But, if the major support is breached, we might expect a heavy selling to take place for  bitcoin 6.22%  and this goes to confirm that the biggest bubble had been popped.

After comparing different possible counts, I feel this is the closest possible scenario for next few month's  BTC 6.30%  moves. 

My target from previous March wave count post remained: 
3-4k, or potentially overshoot below 3k on panic selling. 

Its a Looooong winter for  BTC 6.30% , but I'm very confident that the ensuing Wave5, which will resume previous incredible climb,

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 6.65%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 6.65%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 6.65%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo 0.29%  on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 6.65%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 6.65%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy              With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames.

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

 BTCUSD 7.73%  is clearly in a bear market. It had broken the key  support level  at $6000. Our next target would be 5k followed by 3k. 3k would be a very strong support. But, if the major support is breached, we might expect a heavy selling to take place for  bitcoin 7.73%  and this goes to confirm that the biggest bubble had been popped.

After comparing different possible counts, I feel this is the closest possible scenario for next few month's  BTC 7.76%  moves. 

My target from previous March wave count post remained: 
3-4k, or potentially overshoot below 3k on panic selling. 

Its a Looooong winter for  BTC 7.76% , but I'm very confident that the ensuing Wave5, which will resume previous incredible climb,

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 7.68%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 7.68%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 7.68%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo              on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 7.68%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 7.68%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy              With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether.

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 6.75%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 6.75%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 6.75%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo              on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 6.75%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 6.75%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy              With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it.

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 7.13%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 7.13%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 7.13%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo              on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 7.13%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 7.13%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy -4.00%  With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it.

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

A  bullish bat  pattern is within range for  Bitcoin 6.96%  to complete, this  bat pattern  is from March 31st - July 1st, a 90-day cycle.  

If we observe the market geometry in the Square of 144, we see a strong  support zone  of the 1x5 angle as well as the 2/8th MAJOR  harmonic pivot  at the 5600 value area. Let's also review the time cycles 

1. End and Beginning of a new Law of Vibration Cycle. 
2. Middle of a Square of 52. 
3. June 22nd - July 7th  Gann  Season and Date - strong probability of  support and resistance  being found during this time, trending markets often begin a 90 to 180 day corrective/reversal move.  
4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 6.96%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 6.96%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo              on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 6.96%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 6.96%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy              With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it.

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

 BTCUSD 6.96%  is clearly in a bear market. It had broken the key  support level  at $6000. Our next target would be 5k followed by 3k. 3k would be a very strong support. But, if the major support is breached, we might expect a heavy selling to take place for  bitcoin 6.96%  and this goes to confirm that the biggest bubble had been popped.

The triple exponential average ( TRIX ) indicator is an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and it can also be used as a  momentum indicator . Like many oscillators,  TRIX  oscillates around a zero line. When it is used as an oscillator, a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market. When  TRIX  is used as a  momentum indicator , a positive value suggests momentum is increasing while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing. Many analysts believe that when the  TRIX  crosses above the zero line it gives a buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal. Also, divergences between price and  TRIX  can indicate significant turning points in the market.  


TRIX  calculates a  triple exponential moving average  of the log of the price input over the period of time specified by the length input for the current bar. The current bar's value is subtracted by the previous bar's value. This prevents cycles that are shorter than the period defined by length input from being considered by the indicator.

4. 'Death Zone' Cycle - 7 week cycle, 7x7=49 days. 49 Days is what  Gann  called the 'Death Zone' - it ends blow-off moves. This is actually an important thing to recognize: this current cycle has been a >40% reduction in Bitcoin's price from the previous swing high.  
5.  Full Moon  -  Bitcoin 6.86%  has the highest probability of finding rising prices when it is near a swing low at the appearance of a  Full Moon  lunar phase. That happened on the 27th of June.  
6. Mars went retrograde on the 26th of June, Mars retrograde has only appeared twice in Bitcoin's trading history and in each of the prior retrograde phases,  Bitcoin 6.86%  experienced the highest % gains in its history. For whatever reason, cryptocurrencies are extremely sensitive to any important Mars aspect or cycle.  
7. Mercury enters  Leo 0.29%  on June 29th. 
8, Uranus exits Taurus on July 1st and re-enters on September 14th. Uranus is a planet that initiates change and conflict. Taurus represents the basic opposite: stability, tradition and security.  
9. Additionally, look at the  DXY -0.89%  index and see that it is taking a huge dump, this could be a strong trigger for short-term sentiment and provide fuel for  Bitcoin 6.86%  to rally higher against the dollar.  

Let's also remember one of the basic principles of Dow theory as it applies to panic phases and accumulation phases: extreme  bearish  and negative news and sentiment, but price action fails to produce increasingly dramatic lows.  

Additionally, if we analyze the price action and history of  Bitcoin 6.86%  during the Summer months (June 22 - Sept 22) we often see a flat or falling prices, followed by MASSIVE rallies and exponential gains going into Fall.

The  vortex  indicator plots two oscillating lines, one to identify positive trend movement and the other to identify negative price movement. Crosses between the lines trigger buy and sell signals that are designed to capture the most dynamic trending action, higher or lower. There’s no neutral setting for the indicator, which will always generate a  bullish  or  bearish  bias. You can find the complete  vortex  indicator calculations here. 

Indicator construction revolves around the highs and lows of the last two days or periods. The distance from the current high to the prior low designates positive trend movement while the distance between the current low and the prior high designates negative trend movement. Strongly positive or negative trend movements will show a longer length between the two numbers while weaker positive or negative trend movement will show a shorter length. 


Readings are usually captured over 14 periods (though the technician can choose any length) and then adjusted using J. Welles Wilder’s true range. Results are posted as continuous lines beneath price bars, while crossovers are compared to other trend-following indicators to produce valid trading signals. Traders can use the  vortex  indicator as a standalone signal generator, but keep in mind it is vulnerable to significant whipsaws and false signals in congested or mixed markets.   

Synergy -4.00%  With Other Indicators 
Adjusting the  vortex  indicator to longer periods will lower the frequency of whipsaws but generate delayed positive or negative crossovers. On the other hand, shortening the length will elicit many crossovers that fail to generate significant trend movement. As a general rule, high beta securities will respond better to shorter-term settings while slow-moving securities respond better to longer-term settings.   

You can improve indicator reliability by comparing  vortex  indicator signals with other trend-following tools. The underlying math shows many similarities with Wilder's  average directional index  ( ADX ), the negative directional indicator ( -DI ) and the positive directional indicator ( +DI ). Those calculations translate into three lines that trigger complex crossovers. Unlike the  vortex  indicator, Wilder’s system can issue neutral readings that tell traders to stand pat or avoid exposure. 

Moving average convergence-divergence ( MACD ) analysis offers a perfect fit with the  vortex  indicator. Its construction with three moving averages lowers false readings triggered by multiple indicators that capture the same flawed data. When plotted with histograms, the indicator generates surprisingly few false signals, making it a perfect partner for the noisier and whipsaw-prone  vortex  indicator. 

Synergistic trading strategies use a simple process that looks for sympathetic buy or sell signals in the  vortex  indicators as well as in other indicators before committing capital. The challenge comes in two forms: First, there needs to be significant differences in data sources to avoid replicating flawed information, and second, indicator periods need experimentation and fine tuning to focus on the intended holding period, whether short, intermediate or long term. 

This last step of honing indicator periods is vital because trends exhibit time frame independence, allowing multiple uptrends and downtrends to evolve in different time segments on the same security. This  fractal  behavior will produce false readings if the  vortex  indicator is looking at one segment of trend activity while a second indicator looks at a second segment. Traders can overcome this flaw through trial and error, by watching how indicator pairs interact on various instruments and in various time frames. With  MACD  in particular, it’s often best to leave settings alone and tweak  vortex  indicator periods instead.

just a follow up to last posts ideas. we got a buy limit triggered.  

Take profit at either next blue line. I would even set a breakeven SL at this point if your entry was were I suggested.  

These boxes are calculated not just thrown on there. 


thanks. update coming.

The bears relentless selling doesn't appear to be abating.  Volume  remains weak, supports are being broken with ease, but there's yet to be a capitulation. It seems bulls have left the party altogether. 

As such, the downside prevails and I'm targeting $4200-4450 as the next destination. We may pause at round-number support at $5,000, but technically the price is irrelevant so I would not bet on it holding. To be fair, the $6,000 level may remain significant, as markets overshoot and undershoot all the time. For that to be true, we need to see the coin regain that level within a week or two, and more importantly, to hold it. 

I want to be  bullish , but I see nothing to support that thesis at the moment. Stay away until the tape suggests otherwise unless you like catching falling knives!

So we've got some ups and downs over the last couple of days. Yesterday we broke down and are now making a  bear flag  formation which has high chances it will break down. If it does, it will go to around 5400-5600 before finding support. From that point, there could be another big sell off to around 4800-5000 before going in an uptrend.

 BTCUSD 6.68%  is clearly in a bear market. It had broken the key  support level  at $6000. Our next target would be 5k followed by 3k. 3k would be a very strong support. But, if the major support is breached, we might expect a heavy selling to take place for  bitcoin 6.68%  and this goes to confirm that the biggest bubble had been popped. Let us just hope that it don't happen.
