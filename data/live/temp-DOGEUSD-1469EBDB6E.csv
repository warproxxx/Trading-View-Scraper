1529526009.0,Tradingstrategyguides,DOGEUSD DAY STRATEGY,"
Step #1: Wait until you can spot a bar that has its daily range smaller than the previous three days 
The first rule requires you to have the patience until the Nr4 pattern develops on the Dogecoin chart. When we have a daily trading range that is narrowed than the previous trading ranges it means that the price is contracting. 
Based on our backtesting results we have found out that there is a high probability of a trend move after you spot this type of contraction. This is kind of a general rule because the markets do move from periods of contractions to periods of expansion. 
This is the reason why this short-term price pattern is so powerful. 
Step #2: Mark the High and the Low of the 4th day and switch to the 1 hour time frame   
Our trade is taken the next day after the Nr4 pattern showed up. In order to have a clear view of the short-term price action we need to switch our focus to the 1 hour time frame. Before you switch the time frames make sure you mark on your chart the high and the low of the 4th day. 
Step #3: How to buy Dogecoin: Buy only if the breakout of the Nr4 high happens during the first 5 trading hours. 
We use the Opening Range Breakout technique to time the market and have an effective trade entry. The ORB is even more profitable if it occurs after inside days that have a smaller trading range than the previous 3 days. 
Our Dogecoin trade doesn’t have an inside day, but nevertheless we want to buy only after we break above the Nr4 day high. Also, we want to make sure the breakout happens during the first five trading hours of the next day. 
Trades based on the ORB – Nr4 pattern will show you a profit instantly. 
Now, if the trade is not showing you a profit right away than your trade becomes more vulnerable. As a general rule, if after the first trading hour your trade is not in the green, you can safely close the trade at the market. 
Of course, you can only do that if your stop loss hasn’t been triggered in the meantime. 
Step #4: Place your protective Stop Loss below the Nr4 day low 
You can hide your protective stop loss below the Nr4 day low. Alternatively, you can also place your stop loss below the current day low as this will give you a better risk to reward ratio. 
The ORB – Nr4 pattern tends to precede strong trend day activity, so your stop loss should be rarely hit. Both of these patterns can be traded individually, but when combined they tend to produce even more powerful trades. 
Step #5: Take profit at the close of the first 1-hour  bearish  candle 
Our take profit strategy is fairly easy and it’s slightly modified from the original strategy highlighted in the “Day Trading with Short Term Price Patterns and Opening Range Breakout” book written by Toby Crabel. 
Even though the ORB pattern tends to lead to trend trading days we’re more conservative and want to quickly take profits. So as soon as the first  bearish  candle shows up we close the trade and enjoy our daytrade profits. 
Alternatively, you can keep the trade open until the end of the day if you want to extrapolate more profits from the cryptocurrency market. 
Note** the above was an example of a BUY trade using our Dogecoin cryptocurrency strategy. Use the same rules for a SELL trade – but in reverse. 
PM me if you want to read the complete strategy.

I check 3 things before gambling some  btc 0.01%  on altcoins. 
1) Dominance 
2)  ETH/BTC -5.26% 
3) DOGE/BTC&USD 

1) According to my Dominance analyze, dominance will drop to 29-30 levels. Below those levels are our dream, the golden age of altcoins. 
2) I believe in flippening. If it's going to happen, first shitcoins should finish their pump so money can flow into eth 
3) No comment. Best shitcoin, such good much wow. I think USD pair is more important. And it shows us that 5 cent is not a dream.

I check 3 things before gambling some  btc              on altcoins. 
1) Dominance 
2)  ETH/BTC             
3) DOGE/BTC&USD 

1) According to my Dominance analyze, dominance will drop to 29-30 levels. Below those levels are our dream, the golden age of altcoins. 
2) I believe in flippening. If it's going to happen, first shitcoins should finish their pump so money can flow into eth 
3) No comment. Best shitcoin, such good much wow. I think USD pair is more important. And it shows us that 5 cent is not a dream.

1529526009.0,Tradingstrategyguides,DOGEUSD DAY STRATEGY,"
Step #1: Wait until you can spot a bar that has its daily range smaller than the previous three days 
The first rule requires you to have the patience until the Nr4 pattern develops on the Dogecoin chart. When we have a daily trading range that is narrowed than the previous trading ranges it means that the price is contracting. 
Based on our backtesting results we have found out that there is a high probability of a trend move after you spot this type of contraction. This is kind of a general rule because the markets do move from periods of contractions to periods of expansion. 
This is the reason why this short-term price pattern is so powerful. 
Step #2: Mark the High and the Low of the 4th day and switch to the 1 hour time frame   
Our trade is taken the next day after the Nr4 pattern showed up. In order to have a clear view of the short-term price action we need to switch our focus to the 1 hour time frame. Before you switch the time frames make sure you mark on your chart the high and the low of the 4th day. 
Step #3: How to buy Dogecoin: Buy only if the breakout of the Nr4 high happens during the first 5 trading hours. 
We use the Opening Range Breakout technique to time the market and have an effective trade entry. The ORB is even more profitable if it occurs after inside days that have a smaller trading range than the previous 3 days. 
Our Dogecoin trade doesn’t have an inside day, but nevertheless we want to buy only after we break above the Nr4 day high. Also, we want to make sure the breakout happens during the first five trading hours of the next day. 
Trades based on the ORB – Nr4 pattern will show you a profit instantly. 
Now, if the trade is not showing you a profit right away than your trade becomes more vulnerable. As a general rule, if after the first trading hour your trade is not in the green, you can safely close the trade at the market. 
Of course, you can only do that if your stop loss hasn’t been triggered in the meantime. 
Step #4: Place your protective Stop Loss below the Nr4 day low 
You can hide your protective stop loss below the Nr4 day low. Alternatively, you can also place your stop loss below the current day low as this will give you a better risk to reward ratio. 
The ORB – Nr4 pattern tends to precede strong trend day activity, so your stop loss should be rarely hit. Both of these patterns can be traded individually, but when combined they tend to produce even more powerful trades. 
Step #5: Take profit at the close of the first 1-hour  bearish  candle 
Our take profit strategy is fairly easy and it’s slightly modified from the original strategy highlighted in the “Day Trading with Short Term Price Patterns and Opening Range Breakout” book written by Toby Crabel. 
Even though the ORB pattern tends to lead to trend trading days we’re more conservative and want to quickly take profits. So as soon as the first  bearish  candle shows up we close the trade and enjoy our daytrade profits. 
Alternatively, you can keep the trade open until the end of the day if you want to extrapolate more profits from the cryptocurrency market. 
Note** the above was an example of a BUY trade using our Dogecoin cryptocurrency strategy. Use the same rules for a SELL trade – but in reverse. 
PM me if you want to read the complete strategy.

1) According to my Dominance analyze, dominance will drop to 29-30 levels. Below those levels are our dream, the golden age of altcoins. 
2) I believe in flippening. If it's going to happen, first shitcoins should finish their pump so money can flow into eth 
3) No comment. Best shitcoin, such good much wow. I think USD pair is more important. And it shows us that 5 cent is not a dream.

Step #1: Wait until you can spot a bar that has its daily range smaller than the previous three days 
The first rule requires you to have the patience until the Nr4 pattern develops on the Dogecoin chart. When we have a daily trading range that is narrowed than the previous trading ranges it means that the price is contracting. 
Based on our backtesting results we have found out that there is a high probability of a trend move after you spot this type of contraction. This is kind of a general rule because the markets do move from periods of contractions to periods of expansion. 
This is the reason why this short-term price pattern is so powerful. 
Step #2: Mark the High and the Low of the 4th day and switch to the 1 hour time frame   
Our trade is taken the next day after the Nr4 pattern showed up. In order to have a clear view of the short-term price action we need to switch our focus to the 1 hour time frame. Before you switch the time frames make sure you mark on your chart the high and the low of the 4th day. 
Step #3: How to buy Dogecoin: Buy only if the breakout of the Nr4 high happens during the first 5 trading hours. 
We use the Opening Range Breakout technique to time the market and have an effective trade entry. The ORB is even more profitable if it occurs after inside days that have a smaller trading range than the previous 3 days. 
Our Dogecoin trade doesn’t have an inside day, but nevertheless we want to buy only after we break above the Nr4 day high. Also, we want to make sure the breakout happens during the first five trading hours of the next day. 
Trades based on the ORB – Nr4 pattern will show you a profit instantly. 
Now, if the trade is not showing you a profit right away than your trade becomes more vulnerable. As a general rule, if after the first trading hour your trade is not in the green, you can safely close the trade at the market. 
Of course, you can only do that if your stop loss hasn’t been triggered in the meantime. 
Step #4: Place your protective Stop Loss below the Nr4 day low 
You can hide your protective stop loss below the Nr4 day low. Alternatively, you can also place your stop loss below the current day low as this will give you a better risk to reward ratio. 
The ORB – Nr4 pattern tends to precede strong trend day activity, so your stop loss should be rarely hit. Both of these patterns can be traded individually, but when combined they tend to produce even more powerful trades. 
Step #5: Take profit at the close of the first 1-hour  bearish  candle 
Our take profit strategy is fairly easy and it’s slightly modified from the original strategy highlighted in the “Day Trading with Short Term Price Patterns and Opening Range Breakout” book written by Toby Crabel. 
Even though the ORB pattern tends to lead to trend trading days we’re more conservative and want to quickly take profits. So as soon as the first  bearish  candle shows up we close the trade and enjoy our daytrade profits. 
Alternatively, you can keep the trade open until the end of the day if you want to extrapolate more profits from the cryptocurrency market. 
Note** the above was an example of a BUY trade using our Dogecoin cryptocurrency strategy. Use the same rules for a SELL trade – but in reverse.

A group of altcoins has reached rock-bottom twice now and they seem ready for a bull run. Good time to enter a position on coins listed in my Altcoin Index after doing your own research. Always use a stop loss, and good luck in your trading.

DOGE continues its slow rise in the chart and it seems that it has already exceeded the 100-EMA today and although it had a high  volume , the result was a  volatility  that only gave higher long shadow candles that indicate dominance of the buyers. In this 4 hour chart we see how the last candle can be definitive in the price direction, a close above the 100-EMA can indicate buyer's pressure and a possible long entry.
