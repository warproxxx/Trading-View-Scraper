1530422170.0,ErwinBeckers,BTC/USD.. still busy with its 4th,"
is still correcting and busy completing the 4th. Probable target for the 4th would be the 0.382-0.5 fib levels  
From there we can expect it to finish the impulsive wave up with a 5th wave  
After the 5th wave we get a correction, again to the 0.382-0.5 fib levels of the entire 5 impulsive wave  
And then things get interesting..  

1) Bull scenario this would complete the correction and we get an 5 impulsive wave up again  

2) Bear scenario the previous 5 impulsive wave up is a C on a higher degree and so it finished an  ABC 
Meaning we now we get an 5 impulsive wave down presumably touching the 5.2-5.4k  


My plan.. short as soon as 5 is in.. since in both bull & bear scenario's we're going down.

1530420421.0,jasonwhite,Accumulation Phase with Bitcoin - Wyckoff,"
 Bitcoin -0.13%  is in Wyckoff Schematic #1 Trading Range, it has bounced from the Spring at around $5800, and we'll continue to go higher. 

Our two main resistences on the way up are: 

(1) $6600 
(2) $7000 

$8000 will be our bull trigger. If we go above $8000, I believe we're going for much higher levels, and if we get rejected at $8000 we'll go towards lower levels down to potentially $5000-$5400.
