Ripple reached our targets on Wednesday but retreated later. The currency pair added more than three percent in the past 24 hours. XRP/USD moves along the ascending  trend line  meaning the uptrend is still in force and is able to develop. 

The currency pair tested the  resistance area  at $0.5088 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it. XRP/USD declined towards the ascending  trend line  later. Sellers were unable to push Ripple lower. 
We have a clear  bullish Hammer candlestick  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by jump off the  trend line . This means that Ripple is able to resume its uptrend in the nearest future. The closest target for this upside tendency will be at the closest  resistance area  at $0.5088. 
We also think that XRP/USD will be able to move higher once the resistance is broken. The next target for Thursday-Friday is at $0.5444. As for  bearish  scenario, it is less likely. However, the target for sellers lies at $0.4744.
