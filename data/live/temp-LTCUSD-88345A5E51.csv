1530213190.0,MAGICMARK,LTC ... more down to go?,"
A few months ago someone told me LTC could hit $55.  I looked at them like they had just landed from another planet and where talking out of their hands. 

Today, I sit here shaking my head at this coin. 

I'll admit I used to be an AVID supporter of LTC.  I was a holder ... but this coin has cost me dearly. 

I denied any wrong doing in respect to Charlie selling all his LTC at the absolute peak. 
I gave them grace when litepay launch was delayed. 
Then the bad news came ... litepay was nothing more than hot air, and it evaporated in front of our eyes. 

Since then, this coin has struggled. 

I will say, LTC has always been a slow mover ... slow up, slow down ... but there's a magic point above around $225/$230, where it jumps to $270 maybe $300. We are far from that point, really far.  The slow down part helped when  BTC -0.78%  was dropping, it served as a good coin to hold, IF you were holding ... didn't erode as fast ... but then that changed when litepay vanished. 

I will give LTC another thing ... if I want to transfer crypto, I always convert to LTC. It's fast and cheap to transfer LTC. 

But here's the TA ... this coin is toying with what I would say is the last string before it can drop significantly.  There's a low established in Nov 2017 at 74 and another at 71 ... we hit 75 the other day. Dangerously close. Then it drops almost in increments of $10.  That's how we get to $55.   
A  BTC -0.78%  drop to between $5000 - $5400 will likely put enough sell pressure on to do that to LTC.   

Scary ... poor coin. I'll sit back and watch. There's just too much downside, and the prospect of a slow recovery. I do hope better for LTC holders. I really do...

Hello Traders, 

Here is my analysis of Litecoin. 

Not much to say really, it looks to be painting a bearflag with  bearish  divergence on the VAPI_LB.

1530206822.0,Forex_Academy,"LTC, symmetrical triangle pattern","
Litecoin price has lost -0.74% in the last 24H and we can see here in this 1-H chart how a symmetrical  triangle pattern  is formed with the price still stuck in the central  pivot point  around $79.20, very close to test the resistance and ready to make another move to the support.The 50  EMA  is also following the price as a dynamic resistance and the 100  SMA  keeps below the 200  EMA , technically speaking this means that the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse. My expectation is that a stronger selling pressure is coming and LTC/USD would probably break the support line of this triangle as well.

1530204525.0,Jack777,"LTC in equilibrium, break coming!","
Hey guys, LTC just like big brother  BTC              is right now in a tightening range on the 4H with 81,8 as resistance & 77,8 as support. A break here is coming rather sooner than later, and will see a big move. Of course, the direction will highly depend on big brother  BTC             .  

A bear break is looking at 73,3 at least. Should those not hold, next supports in the Daily are at 70 & 65 respectively. A bull break could lead at least to the recent highs at 84,5.  

=> Since we're in a  bearish trend  , the break of equilibriums always favors the bears, than it does the bulls. But you still have to wait for a clear break,  esp             . with those long wicks & fake-outs. So always be more conservative, miss a few percent rather than getting faked out. Set your orders accordingly, and never forget your stop loss. Look at  BTC              before trading here, LTC isn't going anywhere without big brother. I wish you good luck trading! ;)
