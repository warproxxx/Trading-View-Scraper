1530109614.0,TexasWestCapital,Bitcon's daily chart comparison -- April low v. Current low,"
The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already. I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR              and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin              price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin              can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

I've set alerts and pending orders should  Bitcoin -0.21%  take another dive down. I've been trailing stops from earlier swing trade positions which are now resting at $6,300. 

In line with the current down trend, I'm looking for areas to add to my position.  

We can see a  bear flag  is setting up along the  trend line . A break here would likely result in a long red candle and would be numerous trade opportunities on the alt coins. 

I'm hoping to take majority of my position off the table at $5,600.

Hello Traders, 

BTC -0.18%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin -0.07%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln              in  BTC -0.07% , Seek 4,000  BTC -0.07%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln              in  Bitcoin -0.07%  ( BTC -0.07% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln              more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin -0.07%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC -0.07%  (about $24  mln              at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin -0.07% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin -0.07%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.49%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin -0.08%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -1.65%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC -0.08%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -2.11%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin -0.08%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin -0.08%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.48%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin -0.08%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin -0.08%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC -0.03%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC -0.03%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC -0.03%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC -0.03%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC -0.03%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC -0.03%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC -0.03%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low. Probability favors this but of course I am prepared for the opposite should we somehow skyrocket to a higher high.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.07%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.07%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.07%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.07%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.07%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.07%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.07%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already. I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.32%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.17%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.22%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln 0.05%  in  BTC 0.22% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.22%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln 0.05%  in  Bitcoin 0.22%  ( BTC 0.22% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln 0.05%  more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.22%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.22%  (about $24  mln 0.05%  at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.22% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.22%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.53%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.41%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -1.72%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.41%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -2.76%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.41%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.41%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.32%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area.

The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.93% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.93%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.58%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.62%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -1.74%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.62%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -2.76%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.62%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.62%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.32%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.62%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.62%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.36%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.36%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.36%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.36%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.36%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.36%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.36%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low.

We can see a  bear flag  is setting up along the  trend line . A break here would likely result in a long red candle and would be numerous trade opportunities on the alt coins.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.36%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.36%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.

US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln              in  BTC 0.36% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.36%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln              in  Bitcoin 0.36%  ( BTC 0.36% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln              more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.36%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash.

Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.25%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low.

BTCUSD Shorts -1.89%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369.

I've set alerts and pending orders should  Bitcoin 0.37%  take another dive down. I've been trailing stops from earlier swing trade positions which are now resting at $6,300. 

In line with the current down trend, I'm looking for areas to add to my position.  

We can see a  bear flag  is setting up along the  trend line . A break here would likely result in a long red candle and would be numerous trade opportunities on the alt coins. 

I'm hoping to take majority of my position off the table at $5,600.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.37%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

					Looking at H1, we seem to have an ascending triangle. Even though the reliability of the patterns decreases in smaller time frames, I took a long position with a very tight stop loss. 








This is a very short term position I am taking. Long term still looks very bearish.

Price 
Bitcoin 0.37%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln              in  BTC 0.37% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.37%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln              in  Bitcoin 0.37%  ( BTC 0.37% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln              more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.37%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.37%  (about $24  mln              at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.37% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.37%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.51%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.37%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -1.89%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.37%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -2.60%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.37%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.37%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.32%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.37%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.37%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.36%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.36%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.36%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.36%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.36%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.36%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.36%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low. Probability favors this but of course I am prepared for the opposite should we somehow skyrocket to a higher high.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.27%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.27%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.27%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.27%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.27%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.27%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.27%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low. Probability favors this but of course I am prepared for the opposite should we somehow skyrocket to a higher high.

1530109614.0,TexasWestCapital,Bitcon's daily chart comparison -- April low v. Current low,"
The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already. I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.32%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.27%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.27%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

In line with the current down trend, I'm looking for areas to add to my position.  

We can see a  bear flag  is setting up along the  trend line . A break here would likely result in a long red candle and would be numerous trade opportunities on the alt coins.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.32%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.32%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln              in  BTC 0.32% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.32%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln              in  Bitcoin 0.32%  ( BTC 0.32% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln              more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.32%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.32%  (about $24  mln              at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.32% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.32%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.30%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.41%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.00%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.41%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -2.19%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.41%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.41%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.32%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well.

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.60%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.00%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.60%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures              expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.60%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.60%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR              and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.60%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.60%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC              to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC              starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC              is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC              and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC              will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC              willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC              is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.44%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.43%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln 0.18%  in  BTC 0.43% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.43%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln 0.18%  in  Bitcoin 0.43%  ( BTC 0.43% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln 0.18%  more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.43%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.43%  (about $24  mln 0.18%  at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.43% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.43%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.51%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

BTC 0.55%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

					Looking at H1, we seem to have an ascending triangle. Even though the reliability of the patterns decreases in smaller time frames, I took a long position with a very tight stop loss. 








This is a very short term position I am taking. Long term still looks very bearish.

Price 
Bitcoin 0.55%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln 0.18%  in  BTC 0.55% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.55%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln 0.18%  in  Bitcoin 0.55%  ( BTC 0.55% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln 0.18%  more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.55%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.55%  (about $24  mln 0.18%  at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.55% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.55%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook              has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.55%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.01%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.55%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -2.19%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.55%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.55%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.48%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.55%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.55%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC              to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC              starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC              is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC              and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC              will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC              willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC              is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful. 

Taiwan Bear.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low. Probability favors this but of course I am prepared for the opposite should we somehow skyrocket to a higher high.

3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.58%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.58%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low. Probability favors this but of course I am prepared for the opposite should we somehow skyrocket to a higher high.

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already. I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.48%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.62%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.62%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.72%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.82%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln 0.18%  in  BTC 0.82% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.82%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln 0.18%  in  Bitcoin 0.82%  ( BTC 0.82% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln 0.18%  more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.82%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.82%  (about $24  mln 0.18%  at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.82% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.82%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.56%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.87%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -1.99%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.87%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -2.19%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.87%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.87%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.48%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.87%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.87%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.85%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.85%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.85%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.85%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.85%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week.

Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.71%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.71%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.32%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.71%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.71%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.67%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.67%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.67%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.67%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.67%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.67%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.67%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.45%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.46%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln              in  BTC 0.46% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.46%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln              in  Bitcoin 0.46%  ( BTC 0.46% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln              more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.46%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.46%  (about $24  mln              at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.46% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.46%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.44%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.46%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.21%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.46%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -1.79%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.46%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.46%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted.

However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below).

Bitcoin 0.56%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln              in  BTC 0.56% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.56%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln              in  Bitcoin 0.56%  ( BTC 0.56% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln              more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.56%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.56%  (about $24  mln              at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.56% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.56%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.28%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.56%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.10%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.56%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -1.79%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.56%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.56%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.32%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.56%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.56%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.53%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.53%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.53%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.53%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.53%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.53%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.53%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low. Probability favors this but of course I am prepared for the opposite should we somehow skyrocket to a higher high.

I've set alerts and pending orders should  Bitcoin 0.52%  take another dive down. I've been trailing stops from earlier swing trade positions which are now resting at $6,300. 

In line with the current down trend, I'm looking for areas to add to my position.  

We can see a  bear flag  is setting up along the  trend line . A break here would likely result in a long red candle and would be numerous trade opportunities on the alt coins. 

I'm hoping to take majority of my position off the table at $5,600.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.52%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already. I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.48%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.43%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.43%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

I've set alerts and pending orders should  Bitcoin 0.43%  take another dive down. I've been trailing stops from earlier swing trade positions which are now resting at $6,300. 

In line with the current down trend, I'm looking for areas to add to my position.  

We can see a  bear flag  is setting up along the  trend line . A break here would likely result in a long red candle and would be numerous trade opportunities on the alt coins. 

I'm hoping to take majority of my position off the table at $5,600.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.43%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.43%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln              in  BTC 0.43% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.43%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln              in  Bitcoin 0.43%  ( BTC 0.43% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln              more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.43%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.43%  (about $24  mln              at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.43% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.43%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.38%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.43%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.01%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.43%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -1.38%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.43%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.43%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.32%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.43%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.43%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.43%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.43%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.43%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.43%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.43%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.43%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.43%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful. 

Taiwan Bear.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low. Probability favors this but of course I am prepared for the opposite should we somehow skyrocket to a higher high.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.43%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.43%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.43%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.43%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.43%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.43%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.43%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low.

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already. I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR              and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.

Hello Traders, 

BTC              has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.46%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln 0.05%  in  BTC 0.46% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.46%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln 0.05%  in  Bitcoin 0.46%  ( BTC 0.46% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln 0.05%  more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.46%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.46%  (about $24  mln 0.05%  at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.46% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.46%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.43%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.47%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.01%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.47%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -1.46%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.47%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.47%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR              and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area.

Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.42%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.39%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.42%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.02%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.42%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -1.38%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.42%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.42%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.32%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.42%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.42%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.42%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.42%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.42%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.42%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.42%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.42%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.42%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high.

In line with the current down trend, I'm looking for areas to add to my position.  

We can see a  bear flag  is setting up along the  trend line . A break here would likely result in a long red candle and would be numerous trade opportunities on the alt coins.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.42%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.42%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.

US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln              in  BTC 0.42% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.42%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln              in  Bitcoin 0.42%  ( BTC 0.42% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln              more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.42%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash.

I've set alerts and pending orders should  Bitcoin 0.43%  take another dive down. I've been trailing stops from earlier swing trade positions which are now resting at $6,300. 

In line with the current down trend, I'm looking for areas to add to my position.  

We can see a  bear flag  is setting up along the  trend line . A break here would likely result in a long red candle and would be numerous trade opportunities on the alt coins. 

I'm hoping to take majority of my position off the table at $5,600.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.43%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

					Looking at H1, we seem to have an ascending triangle. Even though the reliability of the patterns decreases in smaller time frames, I took a long position with a very tight stop loss. 








This is a very short term position I am taking. Long term still looks very bearish.

Price 
Bitcoin              continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln              in  BTC             , Seek 4,000  BTC              More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln              in  Bitcoin              ( BTC             ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln              more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin              and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC              (about $24  mln              at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin             . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin              may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook              has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.27%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.02%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.27%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -1.22%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.27%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.27%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.48%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.27%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.27%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.23%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.23%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.23%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.23%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.23%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.23%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.23%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low. Probability favors this but of course I am prepared for the opposite should we somehow skyrocket to a higher high.

Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.27%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.27%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.27%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.27%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.27%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.27%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.27%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful. 

Taiwan Bear.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low. Probability favors this but of course I am prepared for the opposite should we somehow skyrocket to a higher high.

1530109614.0,TexasWestCapital,Bitcon's daily chart comparison -- April low v. Current low,"
The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already. I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.48%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.29%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.29%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

In line with the current down trend, I'm looking for areas to add to my position.  

We can see a  bear flag  is setting up along the  trend line . A break here would likely result in a long red candle and would be numerous trade opportunities on the alt coins.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.44%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.44%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln 0.05%  in  BTC 0.44% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.44%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln 0.05%  in  Bitcoin 0.44%  ( BTC 0.44% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln 0.05%  more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.44%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.44%  (about $24  mln 0.05%  at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.44% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.44%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.46%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.44%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.11%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.44%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -1.06%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.44%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.44%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.48%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well.

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.40%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.28%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.40%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures              expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.40%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.40%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR              and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.40%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.40%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC              to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC              starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC              is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC              and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC              will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC              willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC              is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.44%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.45%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln 0.10%  in  BTC 0.45% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.45%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln 0.10%  in  Bitcoin 0.45%  ( BTC 0.45% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln 0.10%  more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.45%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.45%  (about $24  mln 0.10%  at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.45% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.45%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.30%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

					Looking at H1, we seem to have an ascending triangle. Even though the reliability of the patterns decreases in smaller time frames, I took a long position with a very tight stop loss. 








This is a very short term position I am taking. Long term still looks very bearish.

Price 
Bitcoin 0.58%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln 0.10%  in  BTC 0.58% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.58%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln 0.10%  in  Bitcoin 0.58%  ( BTC 0.58% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln 0.10%  more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.58%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.58%  (about $24  mln 0.10%  at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.58% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.58%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.28%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.52%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.39%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.52%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -1.06%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.52%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.52%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR              and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.52%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.52%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC              to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC              starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC              is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC              and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC              will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC              willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC              is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful. 

Taiwan Bear.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low. Probability favors this but of course I am prepared for the opposite should we somehow skyrocket to a higher high.

Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish .

3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.61%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.61%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low. Probability favors this but of course I am prepared for the opposite should we somehow skyrocket to a higher high.

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already. I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.48%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.56%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.56%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

In line with the current down trend, I'm looking for areas to add to my position.  

We can see a  bear flag  is setting up along the  trend line . A break here would likely result in a long red candle and would be numerous trade opportunities on the alt coins.

Hello Traders, 

BTC              has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin              continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln              in  BTC             , Seek 4,000  BTC              More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln              in  Bitcoin              ( BTC             ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln              more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin              and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC              (about $24  mln              at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin             . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin              may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook              has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.53%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.54%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.53%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures              expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.53%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.53%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR              and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.53%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.53%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.53%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.53%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.53%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.53%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.53%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.49%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk.

Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.49%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.49%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.48%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.49%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.49%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.49%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.49%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.49%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.49%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.49%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.49%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.49%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.49%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.49%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln 0.10%  in  BTC 0.49% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.49%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln 0.10%  in  Bitcoin 0.49%  ( BTC 0.49% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln 0.10%  more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.49%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.49%  (about $24  mln 0.10%  at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.49% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.49%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.10%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.49%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.54%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.49%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -1.06%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration.

Bitcoin 0.36%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.

US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln 0.10%  in  BTC 0.36% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.36%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln 0.10%  in  Bitcoin 0.36%  ( BTC 0.36% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln 0.10%  more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.36%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.36%  (about $24  mln 0.10%  at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.36% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.36%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.09%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.27%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.54%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.27%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -1.22%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.27%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.27%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.48%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.27%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.27%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.27%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.27%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.27%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.27%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.27%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.27%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.27%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low. Probability favors this but of course I am prepared for the opposite should we somehow skyrocket to a higher high.

I've set alerts and pending orders should  Bitcoin 0.33%  take another dive down. I've been trailing stops from earlier swing trade positions which are now resting at $6,300. 

In line with the current down trend, I'm looking for areas to add to my position.  

We can see a  bear flag  is setting up along the  trend line . A break here would likely result in a long red candle and would be numerous trade opportunities on the alt coins. 

I'm hoping to take majority of my position off the table at $5,600.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.33%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already. I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR              and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin              price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin              can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

I've set alerts and pending orders should  Bitcoin 0.33%  take another dive down. I've been trailing stops from earlier swing trade positions which are now resting at $6,300. 

In line with the current down trend, I'm looking for areas to add to my position.  

We can see a  bear flag  is setting up along the  trend line . A break here would likely result in a long red candle and would be numerous trade opportunities on the alt coins. 

I'm hoping to take majority of my position off the table at $5,600.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.33%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.33%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln 0.10%  in  BTC 0.33% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.33%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln 0.10%  in  Bitcoin 0.33%  ( BTC 0.33% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln 0.10%  more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.33%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.33%  (about $24  mln 0.10%  at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.33% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.33%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.08%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.33%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.51%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.33%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -1.22%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.33%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.33%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.48%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.33%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.33%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.33%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.33%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.33%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.33%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.33%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.33%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.33%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful. 

Taiwan Bear.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low. Probability favors this but of course I am prepared for the opposite should we somehow skyrocket to a higher high.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC              to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC              starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC              is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC              and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC              will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC              willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC              is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low. Probability favors this but of course I am prepared for the opposite should we somehow skyrocket to a higher high.

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already. I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.32%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.33%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.29%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln              in  BTC 0.29% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.29%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln              in  Bitcoin 0.29%  ( BTC 0.29% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln              more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.29%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.29%  (about $24  mln              at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.29% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.29%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.09%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin              is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts              continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC              dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures              expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin              will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin              won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR              and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area.

As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle.

BTC 0.29%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards.

Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable.

US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln 0.05%  in  BTC 0.29% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.29%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln 0.05%  in  Bitcoin 0.29%  ( BTC 0.29% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln 0.05%  more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.29%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash.

Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.29%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook -0.04%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.29%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.51%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.29%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -1.46%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.29%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.29%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.32%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.29%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.29%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.29%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.29%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.29%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.29%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.29%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.29%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.29%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high.

In line with the current down trend, I'm looking for areas to add to my position.  

We can see a  bear flag  is setting up along the  trend line . A break here would likely result in a long red candle and would be numerous trade opportunities on the alt coins.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.29%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.29%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.

US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln 0.10%  in  BTC 0.29% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.29%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln 0.10%  in  Bitcoin 0.29%  ( BTC 0.29% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln 0.10%  more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.29%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash.

I've set alerts and pending orders should  Bitcoin 0.36%  take another dive down. I've been trailing stops from earlier swing trade positions which are now resting at $6,300. 

In line with the current down trend, I'm looking for areas to add to my position.  

We can see a  bear flag  is setting up along the  trend line . A break here would likely result in a long red candle and would be numerous trade opportunities on the alt coins. 

I'm hoping to take majority of my position off the table at $5,600.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.35%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.35%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln 0.10%  in  BTC 0.35% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.35%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln 0.10%  in  Bitcoin 0.35%  ( BTC 0.35% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln 0.10%  more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.35%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.35%  (about $24  mln 0.10%  at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.35% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.35%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook              has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.35%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.54%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.35%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -1.06%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.35%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.35%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.32%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.35%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.35%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.35%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.35%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.35%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.35%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.35%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.35%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.35%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low. Probability favors this but of course I am prepared for the opposite should we somehow skyrocket to a higher high.

Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.42%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.42%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.42%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.42%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.42%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.42%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.42%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful. 

Taiwan Bear.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low. Probability favors this but of course I am prepared for the opposite should we somehow skyrocket to a higher high.

1530109614.0,TexasWestCapital,Bitcon's daily chart comparison -- April low v. Current low,"
The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already. I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.32%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.42%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.42%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

I've set alerts and pending orders should  Bitcoin 0.42%  take another dive down. I've been trailing stops from earlier swing trade positions which are now resting at $6,300. 

In line with the current down trend, I'm looking for areas to add to my position.  

We can see a  bear flag  is setting up along the  trend line . A break here would likely result in a long red candle and would be numerous trade opportunities on the alt coins.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.42%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.42%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln 0.08%  in  BTC 0.42% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.42%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln 0.08%  in  Bitcoin 0.42%  ( BTC 0.42% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln 0.08%  more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.42%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.42%  (about $24  mln 0.08%  at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.42% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.42%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook              has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.42%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.50%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.42%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures              expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.42%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.42%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR              and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well.

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.42%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.50%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.42%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -1.22%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.42%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.42%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.48%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.42%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.42%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.42%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.42%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.42%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.42%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.42%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.42%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.42%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.42%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.42%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln              in  BTC 0.42% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.42%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln              in  Bitcoin 0.42%  ( BTC 0.42% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln              more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.42%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.42%  (about $24  mln              at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.42% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.42%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.03%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.34%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

					Looking at H1, we seem to have an ascending triangle. Even though the reliability of the patterns decreases in smaller time frames, I took a long position with a very tight stop loss. 








This is a very short term position I am taking. Long term still looks very bearish.

Price 
Bitcoin 0.34%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln              in  BTC 0.34% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.34%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln              in  Bitcoin 0.34%  ( BTC 0.34% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln              more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.34%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.34%  (about $24  mln              at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.34% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.34%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.02%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.34%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.49%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.34%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -1.22%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.34%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.34%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.48%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.34%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.34%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.34%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.34%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.34%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.34%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.34%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.34%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.34%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful. 

Taiwan Bear.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low. Probability favors this but of course I am prepared for the opposite should we somehow skyrocket to a higher high.

We can see a  bear flag  is setting up along the  trend line . A break here would likely result in a long red candle and would be numerous trade opportunities on the alt coins.

3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.34%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.34%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low. Probability favors this but of course I am prepared for the opposite should we somehow skyrocket to a higher high.

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already. I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.32%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.34%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.34%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

In line with the current down trend, I'm looking for areas to add to my position.  

We can see a  bear flag  is setting up along the  trend line . A break here would likely result in a long red candle and would be numerous trade opportunities on the alt coins.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.34%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.34%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln 0.10%  in  BTC 0.34% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.34%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln 0.10%  in  Bitcoin 0.34%  ( BTC 0.34% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln 0.10%  more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.34%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.34%  (about $24  mln 0.10%  at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.34% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.34%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.05%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.34%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.49%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.34%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -1.22%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.34%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.34%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.32%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.34%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.34%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.34%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.34%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.34%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.34%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.34%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.34%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price.

Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.35%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.35%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.32%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.35%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.35%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.35%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.35%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.35%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.35%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.35%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.35%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.35%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.50%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.50%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln 0.08%  in  BTC 0.50% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.50%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln 0.08%  in  Bitcoin 0.50%  ( BTC 0.50% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln 0.08%  more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.50%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.50%  (about $24  mln 0.08%  at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.50% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.50%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.09%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.57%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.49%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.57%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures              expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration.

This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.57%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s.

Bitcoin 0.55%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln              in  BTC 0.55% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.55%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln              in  Bitcoin 0.55%  ( BTC 0.55% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln              more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.55%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.55%  (about $24  mln              at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.55% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.55%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.09%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.55%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.38%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.55%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -1.22%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.55%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.55%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.48%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.55%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.55%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.57%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.57%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.57%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.57%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.57%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.57%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.57%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low. Probability favors this but of course I am prepared for the opposite should we somehow skyrocket to a higher high.

In line with the current down trend, I'm looking for areas to add to my position.  

We can see a  bear flag  is setting up along the  trend line . A break here would likely result in a long red candle and would be numerous trade opportunities on the alt coins. 

I'm hoping to take majority of my position off the table at $5,600.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.57%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already. I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.48%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.54%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.54%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

I've set alerts and pending orders should  Bitcoin 0.45%  take another dive down. I've been trailing stops from earlier swing trade positions which are now resting at $6,300. 

In line with the current down trend, I'm looking for areas to add to my position.  

We can see a  bear flag  is setting up along the  trend line . A break here would likely result in a long red candle and would be numerous trade opportunities on the alt coins. 

I'm hoping to take majority of my position off the table at $5,600.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.46%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.46%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln 0.08%  in  BTC 0.46% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.46%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln 0.08%  in  Bitcoin 0.46%  ( BTC 0.46% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln 0.08%  more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.46%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.46%  (about $24  mln 0.08%  at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.46% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.46%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook 0.00%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.46%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.42%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.46%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -1.22%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.46%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.46%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.48%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.46%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.46%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.55%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.55%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.55%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.55%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.55%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.55%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.55%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful. 

Taiwan Bear.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low. Probability favors this but of course I am prepared for the opposite should we somehow skyrocket to a higher high.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC              to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC              starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC              is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC              and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC              will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC              willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC              is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high.

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already. I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.48%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well.

Hello Traders, 

BTC 0.54%  has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.54%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0. 

Today forecast 
Trading in the 6000.0 – 6600.0 zone.  

Latest news 
US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln              in  BTC 0.54% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.54%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln              in  Bitcoin 0.54%  ( BTC 0.54% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln              more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.54%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.54%  (about $24  mln              at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales. 
The six-count indictment – unsealed June 22 – alleges that from Nov. 2013 through June 2017, Ryan Farace, 34, sold fake “Xanax” pills on the dark web in exchange for  Bitcoin 0.54% . Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.54%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook              has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.55%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.53%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.55%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -1.22%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.55%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.55%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.48%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well.

Together with Robert Swain, also 34, he is further charged with laundering the proceeds through means “designed to conceal the source and ownership of the illegal funds.” 
Farace now faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on drug distribution counts, with both men facing a maximum of 20 years’ imprisonment on money laundering charges.  
In February, a two-year study of the dark web ecosystem claimed that  Bitcoin 0.73%  may be losing its cachet as the number one currency on darknet markets, seemingly due to users’ frustrations with network traffic and transaction fees. 
Facebook Reverses Ban on Cryptocurrency Ads, Maintains Ban on ICOs 
Facebook -0.02%  has updated its policy to allow cryptocurrencies to once again be advertised, while upholding its ban on the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an announcement published Tuesday, June 26. 
Today’s announcement says the company has been looking into the best way of “refining” its blanket ban on cryptocurrency-related advertising “over the last few months,” in order to “allow some ads while also working to ensure that they’re safe.”   
Facebook's revised ""prohibited products and services policy"" now states: 
“Starting June 26, we’ll  allow ads that promote cryptocurrency and related content from pre-approved advertisers. But we’ll continue to prohibit ads that promote binary options and initial coin offerings.”

1530108883.0,TexasWestCapital,"Bitcon's April low v. Current low (June 27, 2018)","
Good morning, traders. Currently, there appears to be more reason to be  bullish , at least in the short term, than there is to be  bearish . As mentioned in last night's live stream, it looks like  Bitcoin 0.77%  is building a case for a repetition of the April low. However, just because things can appear that way doesn't mean they have to follow through. As always, traders make money with risk management, not win rate.  BTCUSD Shorts -2.52%  continue their drop and Longs continue their rise toward a breakout. As a result, Shorts v. Longs continues to drop as well and are currently sitting at 0.7369. This is a good sign.  BTC 0.77%  dominance precedes bull runs, and if you've been watching our live streams then you know we continue to discuss it. We have been watching the % increase (currently sitting at 42.65%) and expect to see, at the least, a relief rally for the time being as a result. 

https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage 

Looking at a comparison of 4 hour charts from the April low and the current low shows us the pattern repeating.  CME  June  Bitcoin futures -1.22%  expire on June 29th as well. So if you are of the belief that some  OTC              traders are utilizing  futures  to create selling pressure on spot price so that they can get a better  OTC              long deal, then it adds credence to the idea that spot price should rise after the June expiration. Combine that with the understanding that price continues to remain on support without any strong push below it and I believe that should give traders a real pause when arguing that  Bitcoin 0.77%  will continue down from this point. This doesn't guarantee that  Bitcoin 0.77%  won't eventually drop further, just that it seems more likely that we will see some sort of rally in the near term, as mentioned above, culminating in at least a test of the large  wedge  descending resistance line in the $8000s. 

The  daily chart  gives us a large picture of the overall price movement. There is a possibility that the large price movement from February has created one of the two  wedges  noted. The support of the first is derived off the candle bodies and the current low would need to be the spring which means upward momentum would have to breach that resistance line of the descending  wedge . However, if the second is the actual descending  wedge  support line, then we should expect a rally right now, followed by a movement down toward the  support level  one more time in preparation for the actual spring and subsequent bull market return. Either one of these would only be valid if we are in an accumulation phase as I believe we may be at this time. I have provided the Wyckoff of the first already (linked below). I am working on a Wyckoff of the second and will post it once it's done. I am also completing a comparison of this current phase with the accumulation phase after 2014 for those who have some concerns about the size of the  TR -0.48%  and the ensuing  volume  profiles, and will be posting that as well. 

Currently, on this  daily chart , I am watching for  RSI  to breach that descending resistance line. We should expect to see %B breach its own resistance line prior to that.  MACD  is also about to print a  bullish  cross which is inline with a movement up from this general area. While  Bitcoin 0.77%  price did print a  bearish engulfing  candle yesterday, without confirmation today (another  bearish  candle) it means nothing. As of this time, price is printing a potential reversal candle. If  Bitcoin 0.77%  can close the day with a candle similar to its present design, then we would need to see a  bullish  candle tomorrow to confirm it. Reversing today/tomorrow would set up a potential heck of a weekend as liquidity dries up, making it much easier to move price with lower order sizes.

1530103203.0,Taiwan_Bear,Will BTC reach <5k target?,"
Two weeks since my last TA and this little stubborn son of a ...... is still going down within this tiny  downtrend channel . Will it break upwards? I think so. But when? 

I have simplified my previous chart as I have received feedback from people saying the chart is difficult to understand. My idea is still the same in which my main target is still around the 4.7k level. However, I do see the potential of  BTC 0.75%  to go above the previous high $6880 in the next week or two and the possibility of another few weeks of consolidation while market is indecisive. At around 7.5k, I think the market will be divided quite evenly between buyers and sellers. There will be a lot of sellers if  BTC 0.75%  starts to drop again as these people will think  BTC 0.75%  is going down to 3k. But at the same time there will be some investors who might take the advantage to accumulate  BTC 0.75%  and creating a short squeeze. This is just my speculation. I do not control the market. If the price action goes the other way, then just adapt a new thinking. This is trading - if a  support level  gets broken, you short on the pullback or if a resistance gets broken you long on the pullback. 

Whether  BTC 0.75%  will drop below the previous high of $6880 again once it goes above it, will need to be observed later on. But if it does, then 4.7k is definitely in play. But, will it go below 3k? Maybe. In trading, anything is possible, especially in Cryptos. However, there are three things that I would like to point out: 

1. Weekly EMA200 is approaching higher. This will act as another layer of support, in addition to the already strong confluence of support around 4.6-5.2k. 
2. If you have a look of the weekly chart below, the  bearish  candles are getting smaller and smaller. This means the bears are losing momentum after an extended move to the downside. If this week's candle can close with a  doji  then I expect the price to go higher next week. 
3. One of my best friends contacted me yesterday asking me if I know any seller who has great amount of  BTC 0.75%  willing to sell to him as he has buyers who are urged to buy at the current price. So, if you do, PM me. This is not saying that  BTC 0.75%  is going to shoot up from here, but an indication of potential buyers are ready to step in. 

Don't forget to give it a ""LIKE"" if you find this post useful.

4hr chart has the price action respecting the  trendlines  of a falling wedge/bull  pennant . I don't foresee any  bullish  breakoutt hat may come from this pattern being anything substantial..especially the closer it gets to the apex the harder it will be for a breakout to lead to any sort of higher high. If a breakout does occur I anticipate it will most likely form a lower high and then dip again to another lower low. Probability favors this but of course I am prepared for the opposite should we somehow skyrocket to a higher high.

In line with the current down trend, I'm looking for areas to add to my position.  

We can see a  bear flag  is setting up along the  trend line . A break here would likely result in a long red candle and would be numerous trade opportunities on the alt coins.

Hello Traders, 

BTC              has broken the symmetrical triangle on 10th of June, also created an inverse  cup and handle  as a pattern by doing so. Right now we are testing the bottom of the  descending triangle  and the most probable breakout for a  descending triangle  is downwards. 
Potential upwards price action: Only to test the hypotenuse of the  descending triangle  around 6.4-6.5k, depending on the day. If we breakout from the  descending triangle , I might consider long positions. I consider breaking out upwards less probable. 
Potential downward price action: Breakout of the  descending triangle  should occur around 5.8k. When the breakout happens, I don't see any strong support until high 4k area (4.7-4.9k, where long term  trendline  and weekly 100  SMA  acts as support). I consider breaking out downwards more probable. 

Remember, stop buy/stop losses and risk management are the key for successful trading. Patterns might or might not come to realization. They are there to adjust the entry/exit positions and to manage risk. 

This is not a financial advice. Good luck!

Price 
Bitcoin 0.86%  continues narrow lateral movement in the face of the  Bearish Trend Line ; it seems that the price will definitely need substantial support from the fundamental news to break through the  Bearish  tendency. Like in the last time, the long lateral movement says about low demand and could lead the price downwards. 6000.0 level should play a supportive role for the price, dive below the 5750.0 level will drive the price downwards to the 5000.0 support. Breakthrough of the  Bearish Trend Line  should be supported by high volumes and preferably and impulse above the 6300.0.

US Prosecutors Seize $17  Mln              in  BTC 0.86% , Seek 4,000  BTC 0.86%  More for Dark Web Dealings 
U.S. law enforcement has seized $17  mln              in  Bitcoin 0.86%  ( BTC 0.86% ) and other cryptocurrencies, and is seeking to seize about $24  mln              more, from two Maryland, USA men, on charges of selling counterfeit drugs on the dark web, according to a Department of Justice (DoJ) press release published yesterday, June 26. 
In addition to around $17 million in  Bitcoin 0.86%  and other cryptocurrencies, Law enforcement has seized $2.5 million in computer equipment, and over $1.5 million in cash. The government is further seeking to forfeit “no less than” $5.67 million, plus the value of 4,000  BTC 0.86%  (about $24  mln              at press time), believed to be the proceeds of the illegal drug sales.
