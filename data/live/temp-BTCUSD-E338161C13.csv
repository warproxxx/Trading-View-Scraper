Could not defeat 6666. At the moment, it is located at the ceiling of the 10-day canal and the 27-day flag. In the next post, we will point to the behavior that may occur in the coming hours.

 CME BTC -0.66% FUTURES  are Long this week and Short next week. 

The charts show a  Resistance level  up to the $7,600 range this week. 

The charts show a  Support level  in the $6,300 range next week. 


THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE, THIS IS JUST MY OPINION.

Hi guys, 

To continue the past projection. I show you both scenario. As we bounced at the MA500 I expect in the short-mid term to re-test some major resistance. For now the conservative target of a  bullish  rally is at 7.8k where many resistance are. Right now we sitting on big support but the must remains so i show you 2 scenario in this chart.  

So still not out of the woods but it could look like this for the moment as the probable scenario :

1530639412.0,Sawcruhteez,BTC:USD 4 hour chart DAILY UPDATE (day 128),"
Current Outlook 

1-2 weeks: neutral-bullish 
2 weeks - 12 months:  bearish 
1-2+ years: Super bullish 

Three days ago I changed my short term outlook from  bearish  to neutral and over the past couple days I have been leaning  bullish  for the very near term (1-2 weeks). That is due to the tweezer bottom on the weekly chart, breaking a Bill Williams Fractal on the  daily chart , breaking out of the down trend that started on 5/5, the Ichimoku Cloud being out of equilibrium and the bullish crossovers on the shorter term EMA’s.  

If that sounds overwhelming then take a deep breathe and let’s go through each indication step-by-step.  

Tweezer Bottom  on the weekly chart is self-explanatory 








The  Bill Williams  Fractals are in yellow and you will notice that we haven’t broken above one since 5/5 when the downtrend started. We got very close on 6/7 but managed to stay slightly below. We did break a  fractal  on 6/30 when we traded above $6,358. That triggered the stop losses on my BTC:USD and ETH:USD shorts and was my first major indication of a short term reversal.  








We had been steadily resisting the  trend line  from 5/5 and when that broke it served as confirmation of a short term reversal.  








When looking at the  Ichimoku Cloud  on the 3 day chart we can see a large C-Clamp which indicates how far out of equilibrium we currently are. That indicates short term oversold conditions and tells me that this bounce could go much higher than originally expected. The long, flat cloud at $10,400 indicates the furthest I would expect to bounce. If we do get to that price then I would be viewing it as a high probability short.  

We currently have a  bullish  crossover on the 12 and 26 period EMA’s on the following timeframes: 1h, 2h, 4h, 6h, and 12h. As noted yesterday we continue to trade in between those EMA’s on the  daily chart . If wanting to make a  bullish  entry waiting for those EMA's to crossover on the  daily chart  should be your best bet.  








Even with all of the short term  bullish  indicators it is possible to continue to drawdown at any moment. The  daily chart  is threatening a  tweezer top  along with a  bearish spinning top  and that could be all that is needed for the bears to start selling aggressively again.  

I am going to continue waiting on the sidelines for further development. I am still holding onto my ETH:BTC shorts from 0.07479 - 0.07844 and have set the stop loss at 0.0731. I am finding it very interesting that ETH:USD and ETH:BTC have not broken through the downtrend like  Bitcoin -0.66%  has.  

This is a great time of year to get outside and enjoy the weather while waiting for the market to develop! Instead of biting my nails and watching the order book I will be playing golf and softball this evening.

interesting confluence at the grey arrow. Week-long ascending resistance line meets local ascending  wedge  at a perfect apex. High probability of a move at either this time or this price action. 

I think we need to revisit lower levels before a bigger move up. That said, go ahead and place a buy above the 200  EMA  just in case of a bull run, take some profits quick and get ready to buy more on a retest, with a stop loss below. 

Measure twice, cut once. 
May all of life's treasures be yours. 

Please engage with my charts if you appreciate my ideas. I value all your interaction and feedback!

Logarithmic chart. My view on  BTCUSD             . I didn't see  volume  in this market. But of course after 1,5 month falling  bitcoin              need to show correction up.

1530635750.0,jackzumwalt,Breaking the Bear Trend - Three Bullish Formations in Bitcoin,"
Bear with me here because there is a ton of information on this chart (no pun intended). Looking at the 4-hour chart, there are a few  bullish  formations that can be identified: 

1. Ascending  wedge  (light red) 
TARGET: ~8100 (approx 1200  EMA ) 
STATUS: Broken out 

2.  Bull flag  (white) 
TARGET: ~7000 
STATUS: Broken out 

3.  Inverse H&S  (green) 
TARGET: ~7780 (exactly 7780 resistance) 
STATUS: In formation 

This gives us 3 potential targets, all different but luckily all in the same direction. The  bull flag  completes the  inverse H&S  and the  inverse H&S  completes the  wedge . There are 2 underlying paths this could lead us on: 

1. Reach top of  bearish trend line  and collapse again 
2. Reach top of  bearish trend line , find miraculous momentum, and break it. 

Number 2 in this scenario would require other formations in the future to form. As of right now, all we can (hopefully) assume is that we will reach the top of the  bearish trend line . I believe that the  H&S , if formed, will lead this process. The momentum it would give is necessary to break the rising orange resistance line and others in its way. In addition to this, its target would align nearly exactly to the top of the  bearish trend line  given we make some rapid movements. Also, it should be noted that if Number 1 plays out, it would also represent an underlying  Elliot Wave  and result in a retracement. 

This, however, is assuming that each one of these formations play out. I hope this big picture analysis helps you figure out your own strategy.
