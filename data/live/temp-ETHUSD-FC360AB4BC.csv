The teal zone will determine the direction. This will be proven given previous price action. We won't see a trend reversal until we stop making Lower high's and make a higher low.  

Either should be played out one way or another (unless consolidation). Watch  BTC -0.63%  as well, as that pair usually predicts where all altcoins are going.  



Nifty 1.18%  tip: Buy altcoins. Many coins are already down 80-90% from their ATH's. If the price goes lower, buy more to average down your buy-in price. 

Alt season is coming eventually. So might as well get in on the fire sale and load up positions while others FOMO like we saw at the end of 2017. Don't be that guy, be the smart money:)

Follow the Big money trend-line all the way to the top to March 2021. But take a look at that tasty base below it. I think think the instrument is weak enough to test the base below. I just haven't seen the momentum swing like I'd like to see. I'm still long term accumulate and hold but a short term pessimist.

1530398074.0,Peymana71,ETH Analyse.What happened if BTC didn't turn market to Hell?,"
Hi Guys, 
Honestly,I promised myself not to publish any Analyse about Alts and Assets till their free themselves from  BTC -0.64%  pressure but i really can't resist to this Signs and  Bullish  Outlook here,in Alts market. 
Most important thing here is that many of Alts printed a new low with  BTC -0.64%  except ETH.With all pressure of  BTC -0.64%  we saw that ETH ,didn't close to its last lows,even.It was very important sign that show us all this downwards forced by  BTC -0.64%  and maybe if there wasn't any  BTC -0.64%  in market we have much different moves in them. 






Another thing is too obvious is that whole downward in ETH formed a big  Bullish Wedge .In  BTC -0.64%  market it is not that clear like here or many other alts.This  wedge  is near to work perfectly but like always  BTC -0.64%  can change all our expectation again.If all thing go well with  BTC -0.64%  i have 2  bullish  possibility here based on future  BTC -0.64%  move again.If  BTC -0.64%  go up from here we will continue our upward in ETH with red arrow and if  BTC -0.64%  want to find some support in little lower target,ETH will go up like Black arrows. 






Actually if  BTC -0.64%  moves ETH lower,it will form a iH&S that will be really Good.All Things here show us that ETH and most Alts are like a spring that compressed by  BTC -0.64%  and wait for a release. 
We have great signs in  RSI  and have a  bullish  reversal in  MACD  D time frame too. 






To understand better what stop ETH in last bounce,you have to see this chart exactly.As you can see we have a huge triangle formation like  BTC -0.64%  in ETH.I draw two most possible bottom for this triangle in red and black dotted line that show you with arrow in chart.we are stock between this two line and oldest one work as resistance for ETH now,But i'm sure if  BTC -0.64%  went much higher ETH didn't stop here but can't look at it as a accident.After we bounce out of this  bullish wedge ,ETH have a huge resistance about $600 that is roof of that huge triangle. 
Don't forget that  BTC -0.64%  can ruin all this signals and we need to focus on it when enter an Alt trade.I usually suggest my friends to trade in Alts in each  BTC -0.64%  short term/mid term bull market because they are much more profitable than  BTC -0.64%  but must be careful, BTC -0.64%  move down can fell more in Alt market and can destroy your entire portfolio. 
Again thanks to read my ideas,please like this analyse if you like it and leave a comment for me to know what you think. 
Best Regards
