1531121723.0,VARZAR_INVESTMENT,Trading plan: XRPUSD (Ripple),"
The Ripple rate is fixed above $ 0.477. 
Priority of the day: the growth of XRPUSD rate with a target of $ 0.50. 
Buyers seem to slightly raise the price of Ripple, but there is still a small potential for growth. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.477 to $ 0.50. 
2. The XRPUSD rate may remain in flat. 
An alternative scenario: 
Bears at any time can take the initiative in their hands, and reduce the rate of Ripple to $ 0.43.

1531121038.0,InvestingScope,Consolidation broken but downtrend bias quickly resumed. Short.,"
The 1H  Rectangle  broke but after the 4H Channel Down was broken (formation break out), XRPUSD the downtrend was swiftly resumed. 4H extends its consolidation on neutral  RSI  = 50.090,  CCI  = 24.4569, Highs/Lows =  0.000 2.28%  and is limited to a maximum possible extension on the 1D Channel Down (blue dotted lines on  RSI  = 42.063,  MACD  = -0.021, B/BP = -0.0114) at 0.52000. New shorts have been added as our approach remains SOER on this  bearish  1W Channel on Ripple (Highs/Lows = -0.0849). TP intact: 0.4000 and 0.35277.
