1530273101.0,JarkkoYlimaki,XRP super long term plan,"
XRP/USD price is getting close to long term support line all the way from spring 2017. Price just plunged a bit under highs of may 2017.  
Waiting for shopping opportunity at 7-9th of July at 0.36USD.  

Yes, I know putting dates like that is ridiculous.  
All the best

1530270738.0,Coin_Analyst,Ripple (XRPUSD) bears dominating,"
It was mentioned in the previous post that support region for Ripple (XRPUSD) was between ~$0.46 and $0.39, with this region coinciding with the major  bullish trendline  for XRPUSD (Ripple).  

XRPUSD has currently broken below the  trendline , which by itself implies further  bearish  action in Ripple.  Price closing below the lower region of support ($0.39) will provide a stronger evidence for more  bearish  action in Ripple (XRPUSD).  

Ripple (XRPUSD) consolidating within the support region would be a great indication for possible upside potential if the consolidation is confirmed by another independent technical signal e.g. indicators. 
Current market action however favors Ripple (XRPUSD) bears.
