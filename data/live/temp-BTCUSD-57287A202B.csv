We see good preconditions for a local turn.  Volume profile  came to equilibrium and formed two levels of fair prices - one at 6100, the other at 6700.  
The first target and an important level is 6800, but the likelihood that the price will overcome it immediately - is unlikely.

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC             . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD              and  BTCUSD             . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 3.07%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed.

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 3.07%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

The expected exit from the  wedge  occurred. 


We see good preconditions for a local turn.  Volume profile  came to equilibrium and formed two levels of fair prices - one at 6100, the other at 6700.  
The first target and an important level is 6800, but the likelihood that the price will overcome it immediately - is unlikely.  


Exit and consolidation above 6800 means a change in the medium-term trend, and the open prospect of achieving target 7600.

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC 3.07% . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD 0.99%  and  BTCUSD 3.07% . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC 3.07% . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD 0.99%  and  BTCUSD 3.07% . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 3.07%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC             . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD              and  BTCUSD             . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

Two scenarios:

Let's remember not long ago when everyone said 6k  Bitcoin 3.06% , 6k Bitcoin!! And we got to 6500 before the rally up. Lots of people missed out on that initial rally.

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 3.06%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

The expected exit from the  wedge  occurred. 


We see good preconditions for a local turn.  Volume profile  came to equilibrium and formed two levels of fair prices - one at 6100, the other at 6700.  
The first target and an important level is 6800, but the likelihood that the price will overcome it immediately - is unlikely.  


Exit and consolidation above 6800 means a change in the medium-term trend, and the open prospect of achieving target 7600.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

The expected exit from the  wedge  occurred. 


We see good preconditions for a local turn.  Volume profile  came to equilibrium and formed two levels of fair prices - one at 6100, the other at 6700.  
The first target and an important level is 6800, but the likelihood that the price will overcome it immediately - is unlikely.  


Exit and consolidation above 6800 means a change in the medium-term trend, and the open prospect of achieving target 7600.

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC 2.99% . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD 0.99%  and  BTCUSD 2.99% . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 2.99%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC 2.99% . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD 0.99%  and  BTCUSD 2.99% . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 2.99%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 2.96%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

The expected exit from the  wedge  occurred. 


We see good preconditions for a local turn.  Volume profile  came to equilibrium and formed two levels of fair prices - one at 6100, the other at 6700.  
The first target and an important level is 6800, but the likelihood that the price will overcome it immediately - is unlikely.  


Exit and consolidation above 6800 means a change in the medium-term trend, and the open prospect of achieving target 7600.

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC 2.96% . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD 0.99%  and  BTCUSD 2.96% . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC 2.96% . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD 0.99%  and  BTCUSD 2.96% . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 2.90%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC 2.83% . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD 0.99%  and  BTCUSD 2.83% . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 2.83%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

The expected exit from the  wedge  occurred. 


We see good preconditions for a local turn.  Volume profile  came to equilibrium and formed two levels of fair prices - one at 6100, the other at 6700.  
The first target and an important level is 6800, but the likelihood that the price will overcome it immediately - is unlikely.  


Exit and consolidation above 6800 means a change in the medium-term trend, and the open prospect of achieving target 7600.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

The expected exit from the  wedge  occurred. 


We see good preconditions for a local turn.  Volume profile  came to equilibrium and formed two levels of fair prices - one at 6100, the other at 6700.  
The first target and an important level is 6800, but the likelihood that the price will overcome it immediately - is unlikely.  


Exit and consolidation above 6800 means a change in the medium-term trend, and the open prospect of achieving target 7600.

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC 2.83% . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD 0.99%  and  BTCUSD 2.83% . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 2.83%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC 2.85% . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD 0.99%  and  BTCUSD 2.85% . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 2.85%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 2.85%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

The expected exit from the  wedge  occurred. 


We see good preconditions for a local turn.  Volume profile  came to equilibrium and formed two levels of fair prices - one at 6100, the other at 6700.  
The first target and an important level is 6800, but the likelihood that the price will overcome it immediately - is unlikely.  


Exit and consolidation above 6800 means a change in the medium-term trend, and the open prospect of achieving target 7600.

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC 2.87% . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD 0.99%  and  BTCUSD 2.87% . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

We see good preconditions for a local turn.  Volume profile  came to equilibrium and formed two levels of fair prices - one at 6100, the other at 6700.  
The first target and an important level is 6800, but the likelihood that the price will overcome it immediately - is unlikely.

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC 2.87% . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD 0.99%  and  BTCUSD 2.87% . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 2.87%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC 2.88% . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD 0.99%  and  BTCUSD 2.88% . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 2.88%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

The expected exit from the  wedge  occurred. 


We see good preconditions for a local turn.  Volume profile  came to equilibrium and formed two levels of fair prices - one at 6100, the other at 6700.  
The first target and an important level is 6800, but the likelihood that the price will overcome it immediately - is unlikely.  


Exit and consolidation above 6800 means a change in the medium-term trend, and the open prospect of achieving target 7600.

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC 2.92% . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD 0.99%  and  BTCUSD 2.92% . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC 2.94% . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD 0.99%  and  BTCUSD 2.94% . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 2.93%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

Let's remember not long ago when everyone said 6k  Bitcoin 2.91% , 6k Bitcoin!! And we got to 6500 before the rally up. Lots of people missed out on that initial rally.

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 2.92%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

The expected exit from the  wedge  occurred. 


We see good preconditions for a local turn.  Volume profile  came to equilibrium and formed two levels of fair prices - one at 6100, the other at 6700.  
The first target and an important level is 6800, but the likelihood that the price will overcome it immediately - is unlikely.  


Exit and consolidation above 6800 means a change in the medium-term trend, and the open prospect of achieving target 7600.

In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

We see good preconditions for a local turn.  Volume profile  came to equilibrium and formed two levels of fair prices - one at 6100, the other at 6700.  
The first target and an important level is 6800, but the likelihood that the price will overcome it immediately - is unlikely.

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC 2.93% . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD 0.99%  and  BTCUSD 2.93% . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 2.93%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

We see good preconditions for a local turn.  Volume profile  came to equilibrium and formed two levels of fair prices - one at 6100, the other at 6700.  
The first target and an important level is 6800, but the likelihood that the price will overcome it immediately - is unlikely.

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC 2.93% . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD 0.99%  and  BTCUSD 2.93% . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 2.92%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 2.91%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

The expected exit from the  wedge  occurred. 


We see good preconditions for a local turn.  Volume profile  came to equilibrium and formed two levels of fair prices - one at 6100, the other at 6700.  
The first target and an important level is 6800, but the likelihood that the price will overcome it immediately - is unlikely.  


Exit and consolidation above 6800 means a change in the medium-term trend, and the open prospect of achieving target 7600.

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC 2.91% . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD 0.99%  and  BTCUSD 2.91% . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC             . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD              and  BTCUSD             . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 2.91%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC             . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD              and  BTCUSD             . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

Let's remember not long ago when everyone said 6k  Bitcoin 2.91% , 6k Bitcoin!! And we got to 6500 before the rally up. Lots of people missed out on that initial rally.

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 2.91%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

We see good preconditions for a local turn.  Volume profile  came to equilibrium and formed two levels of fair prices - one at 6100, the other at 6700.  
The first target and an important level is 6800, but the likelihood that the price will overcome it immediately - is unlikely.  


Exit and consolidation above 6800 means a change in the medium-term trend, and the open prospect of achieving target 7600.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

We see good preconditions for a local turn.  Volume profile  came to equilibrium and formed two levels of fair prices - one at 6100, the other at 6700.  
The first target and an important level is 6800, but the likelihood that the price will overcome it immediately - is unlikely.  


Exit and consolidation above 6800 means a change in the medium-term trend, and the open prospect of achieving target 7600.

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC 2.91% . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD 0.99%  and  BTCUSD 2.91% . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 2.91%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

- Price will likely keep moving inside the  descending triangle  (since 15/01/2018) 
- Long-term trend (since 17/8/2015 
- Key support (since 28/8/2017) 

All of them collide arround € 5.000,- somewhere in jan or feb 2019 

Without significant news nor a crash nor a bullrun seems likely.

I think we are no longer overheated on the weekly chart and we are at good buying levels. We are ready to start building up momentum for the long side. Target for the end of the year 26k.  

Call it wishfull thinking. Call it a green day. Thats how im feeling it today.

The expected exit from the  wedge  occurred. 


We see good preconditions for a local turn.  Volume profile  came to equilibrium and formed two levels of fair prices - one at 6100, the other at 6700.  
The first target and an important level is 6800, but the likelihood that the price will overcome it immediately - is unlikely.  


Exit and consolidation above 6800 means a change in the medium-term trend, and the open prospect of achieving target 7600.

It was quite an intense week in terms of headlines related to the trade war. The dollar is easing and this inevitably affects the price of  BTC 2.90% . 
We can see a strong correlation here between the  EURUSD 0.99%  and  BTCUSD 2.90% . The gross majority of Crypto-investors are poised to buy on an upward break and this was maybe just the hint we needed to get back in there and buy. I see the 6400 and then 7800 as major areas of consolidation.

Two scenarios:  

1. Potential rounding bottom formation.  

2. Down to 5500, then 5900, then 5150 bottom, then to the moon! 

Let's remember not long ago when everyone said 6k  Bitcoin 2.90% , 6k Bitcoin!! And we got to 6500 before the rally up. Lots of people missed out on that initial rally.  

Now a lot of people are saying 5k, 5k!! ... watch out for that.

I think we will correct to around 7500 area (0.618 fib), because wave 2 had a small correction (0.382 fib).

Hello Lads and Ladies, 

This is just a joke to make your day even better and kill all toxic thoughts from the last days!! 

The question is though, what is  Bitcoin 2.90%  trying to say us?? Or is here even Satoshi trying to communicate to us?!?! Tell me what you think abut that and what might happen next!! 

Nevertheless, I see it coming down a little and turning the blue lines into support, from where we could easily get a little rest and start something great again!!! If the blue lines (around 6250) don't hold, I think we will go down even more. 

If the resistance at 6800 breaks and we can turn it into support, it looks very nice and we will be heading towards 7800.

Our last outing on calling the bottom was quite successful. Though that particular bottom was not nearly this far out. It's taken much work to solve this  Elliott Wave  puzzle. We have had quite a complicated correction. However, I believe we are coming to an end. I should be asleep right now, but I noticed something from the related idea tagged below that caught my eye. In fact, that was because of my previous outing on calling the bottom. I couldn't sleep without charting it out. Feel free to comment your thoughts on the upcoming bottom, when it will hit and what the price will be. I'll go on record first: 

I believe we will hit $5,000 on July 23rd at 0730 CST.  

Everything else below is explaining how we've arrived where we are today. Feel free to ignore it or read it. In the meantime, join us on Telegram! https://t.me/joinchat/IDfLQ1DIHIv1HxVtxGefGw 

Throughout this correction, we have seen some very complicated movements. The first five waves down from nearly 20,000 to 6,000 by itself was a confusing move. Most  Elliott Wave  charters were inclined to call that an  ABC  and call the correction over. Time wise, this did not make sense. We were correcting a multi-year move upward. This is not typically done in a 75 day period. If we analyze this move deeper, we can get a solid 12345, but waves 2 and 4 overlap. This only occurs in a  leading diagonal  or an  ending diagonal . Being that it was the first move, it would clearly be a  leading diagonal . This by itself means that we should label this move down as (A).  

Following that, we should start a B movement. Again, this was tricky. Many thought we were starting an impulse or perhaps we had an  ABC  with a truncated C. For me, I did not have clarity on an  Elliott Wave  count until I saw this move clearly. I looked at the related idea ""Let's Call the Bottom"" and realized that my count probably wasn't accurate. In fact, the move in that count appeared to be a diagonal. Based on where it appeared in the count, we can determine that it must be a  leading diagonal  and must be an A wave.  

In realizing these two counts, you can put the rest of the puzzle together around them.  

So where does that leave us now? We started a C wave down from 10,000. If correct, my count would have the END of the correction at the end of this C wave. Does that mean that we would immediately moonshot?  

Drum roll.... 

No. Sorry. 

We have been slowing down and moving more and more sideways. You can easily compare the primary A down from 20,000 with the primary C down from 10,000 and see that we are moving nearly sideways in comparison. This is how bottoms are typically formed. We may see a small V once we reach the termination of wave C, but that does not mean that we would then moonshot past 20,000. It would likely start as a gradual and steady climb and over time we would again see the growth begin to go parabolic.  

If July 23rd is the correct date for the completion of this correction, we are looking at just over 220 days of correction which accounts for approximately 26% of the time that we spent impulsing upward since the last major correction. This is actually still a bit on the low side. This is my ONLY hesitation with the count presented. I previously expected to be correcting much longer.  

I will update the idea as I can with subwaves and refined targets/dates. Make sure to comment your guess for the bottom, date/time/price! I was about 24 hours off last time I posted this, but I wasn't predicting 3.5 weeks out either. Will be interesting to see how it plays out!

					To clarify for all of those who would like to submit a guess, I'm looking for guesses for the NEXT bottom. I believe it will be the final bottom. If you don't think the next bottom will be the final bottom, feel free to chime in with that info as well. Or even if you think the ""next"" bottom already happened.
