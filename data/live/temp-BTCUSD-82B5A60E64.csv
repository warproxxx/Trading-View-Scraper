Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin             , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)

After seemingly breaking down from the first  wedge  but not getting a big enough red candle to go with it I have readjusted the smaller green  rising wedge  to fit more of a traditional  bull flag  shape. Was also able to widen the larger purple  rising wedge  with the newer candles wicks to see that we are still very much inside the bigger  rising wedge . We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.  Current stochrsi, and  rsi  on the 4hr chart seem like  tey 1.95%  are ready for an upward climb as well. All these things considered makes this idea a neutral one.

 BTC 1.07%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier. 

If you are taking a position - keep an eye on the charts and try to buy in the 6300 range - otherwise if you are holding - enjoy the show.

1530895098.0,mozartc,Tom Lee and the price of Bitcoin,"
 Bitcoin              hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin              has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin              and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin              and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN              REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins              that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin              price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin              ( BTC             ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC              is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC              is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC              risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line . 
If we fail to break out of the trend at $6,400, which I don't believe we would fail, we'll fall out of the descending  wedge  to $4,800 and $3,000. 

With lower  volume  comes more oblique angles in the reversals of price. These means less momentum/pressure to both the up and down side. The first reversal line is almost vertical, the second at a 45 degree and the third even more shallow. We can expect the pattern to continue for the next waves. For this current wave, the resistances and fibonacci line up well with each other.  Elliot  waves can tell a rather predictable climb up, assuming things go well. Finally, if  volume  doesn't kick this reversal beyond the down  trend line , we'll see $5,800 and $5,500 as new bottom targets as we reach the bottom of the descending  wedge .

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 1.13% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)  

About myself: Global citizen & early  Bitcoin 1.13%  adopter from Germany. I invested in the 2nd rally from 50 to 1.000 Dollars in  BTC 1.13%  .

After seemingly breaking down from the first  wedge  but not getting a big enough red candle to go with it I have readjusted the smaller green  rising wedge  to fit more of a traditional  bull flag  shape. Was also able to widen the larger purple  rising wedge  with the newer candles wicks to see that we are still very much inside the bigger  rising wedge . We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.  Current stochrsi, and  rsi  on the 4hr chart seem like  tey              are ready for an upward climb as well. All these things considered makes this idea a neutral one.

Watching for another dip to complete the right side of this  Inverse Head and Shoulders  pattern. Looks like just around $6,800 is our neckline. Could take a day or two for this pattern to play out.

 BTC 1.13%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier. 

If you are taking a position - keep an eye on the charts and try to buy in the 6300 range - otherwise if you are holding - enjoy the show.

 Bitcoin 1.13%  hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin 1.13%  has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 1.13%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 1.13%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 1.13%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 1.13%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 1.13%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin 1.13%  ( BTC 1.13% ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC 1.13%  is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC 1.13%  is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC 1.13%  risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line . 
If we fail to break out of the trend at $6,400, which I don't believe we would fail, we'll fall out of the descending  wedge  to $4,800 and $3,000. 

With lower  volume  comes more oblique angles in the reversals of price. These means less momentum/pressure to both the up and down side. The first reversal line is almost vertical, the second at a 45 degree and the third even more shallow. We can expect the pattern to continue for the next waves. For this current wave, the resistances and fibonacci line up well with each other.  Elliot  waves can tell a rather predictable climb up, assuming things go well. Finally, if  volume  doesn't kick this reversal beyond the down  trend line , we'll see $5,800 and $5,500 as new bottom targets as we reach the bottom of the descending  wedge .

 BTC 1.13%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier.

 Bitcoin 1.13%  hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin 1.13%  has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 1.13%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 1.13%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 1.13%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 1.13%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 1.13%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin 1.13%  ( BTC 1.13% ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC 1.13%  is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC 1.13%  is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC 1.13%  risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line . 
If we fail to break out of the trend at $6,400, which I don't believe we would fail, we'll fall out of the descending  wedge  to $4,800 and $3,000. 

With lower  volume  comes more oblique angles in the reversals of price. These means less momentum/pressure to both the up and down side. The first reversal line is almost vertical, the second at a 45 degree and the third even more shallow. We can expect the pattern to continue for the next waves. For this current wave, the resistances and fibonacci line up well with each other.  Elliot  waves can tell a rather predictable climb up, assuming things go well. Finally, if  volume  doesn't kick this reversal beyond the down  trend line , we'll see $5,800 and $5,500 as new bottom targets as we reach the bottom of the descending  wedge .

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 1.07% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.

 BTC 1.04%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier.

 Bitcoin 1.04%  hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin 1.04%  has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 1.04%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 1.04%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 1.04%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 1.04%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 1.04%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin 1.04%  ( BTC 1.04% ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC 1.04%  is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC 1.04%  is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC 1.04%  risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line . 
If we fail to break out of the trend at $6,400, which I don't believe we would fail, we'll fall out of the descending  wedge  to $4,800 and $3,000. 

With lower  volume  comes more oblique angles in the reversals of price. These means less momentum/pressure to both the up and down side. The first reversal line is almost vertical, the second at a 45 degree and the third even more shallow. We can expect the pattern to continue for the next waves. For this current wave, the resistances and fibonacci line up well with each other.  Elliot  waves can tell a rather predictable climb up, assuming things go well. Finally, if  volume  doesn't kick this reversal beyond the down  trend line , we'll see $5,800 and $5,500 as new bottom targets as we reach the bottom of the descending  wedge .

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 1.05% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)

 BTC 0.99%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier. 

If you are taking a position - keep an eye on the charts and try to buy in the 6300 range - otherwise if you are holding - enjoy the show.

 Bitcoin 0.99%  hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin 0.99%  has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 0.99%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 0.99%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 0.99%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 0.99%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 0.99%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin 0.99%  ( BTC 0.99% ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC 0.99%  is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC 0.99%  is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC 0.99%  risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line . 
If we fail to break out of the trend at $6,400, which I don't believe we would fail, we'll fall out of the descending  wedge  to $4,800 and $3,000. 

With lower  volume  comes more oblique angles in the reversals of price. These means less momentum/pressure to both the up and down side. The first reversal line is almost vertical, the second at a 45 degree and the third even more shallow. We can expect the pattern to continue for the next waves. For this current wave, the resistances and fibonacci line up well with each other.  Elliot  waves can tell a rather predictable climb up, assuming things go well. Finally, if  volume  doesn't kick this reversal beyond the down  trend line , we'll see $5,800 and $5,500 as new bottom targets as we reach the bottom of the descending  wedge .

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 0.99% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)

We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.

 Bitcoin 0.99%  hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin 0.99%  has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 0.99%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 0.99%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 0.99%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 0.99%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 0.99%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin              ( BTC             ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC              is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC              is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC              risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line . 
If we fail to break out of the trend at $6,400, which I don't believe we would fail, we'll fall out of the descending  wedge  to $4,800 and $3,000. 

With lower  volume  comes more oblique angles in the reversals of price. These means less momentum/pressure to both the up and down side. The first reversal line is almost vertical, the second at a 45 degree and the third even more shallow. We can expect the pattern to continue for the next waves. For this current wave, the resistances and fibonacci line up well with each other.  Elliot  waves can tell a rather predictable climb up, assuming things go well. Finally, if  volume  doesn't kick this reversal beyond the down  trend line , we'll see $5,800 and $5,500 as new bottom targets as we reach the bottom of the descending  wedge .

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin             , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)

After seemingly breaking down from the first  wedge  but not getting a big enough red candle to go with it I have readjusted the smaller green  rising wedge  to fit more of a traditional  bull flag  shape. Was also able to widen the larger purple  rising wedge  with the newer candles wicks to see that we are still very much inside the bigger  rising wedge . We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.  Current stochrsi, and  rsi  on the 4hr chart seem like  tey              are ready for an upward climb as well. All these things considered makes this idea a neutral one.

 BTC 0.99%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier. 

If you are taking a position - keep an eye on the charts and try to buy in the 6300 range - otherwise if you are holding - enjoy the show.

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 0.96%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 0.96%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 0.96%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 0.96%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 0.96%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin 0.96%  ( BTC 0.96% ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC 0.96%  is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC 0.96%  is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC 0.96%  risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line . 
If we fail to break out of the trend at $6,400, which I don't believe we would fail, we'll fall out of the descending  wedge  to $4,800 and $3,000. 

With lower  volume  comes more oblique angles in the reversals of price. These means less momentum/pressure to both the up and down side. The first reversal line is almost vertical, the second at a 45 degree and the third even more shallow. We can expect the pattern to continue for the next waves. For this current wave, the resistances and fibonacci line up well with each other.  Elliot  waves can tell a rather predictable climb up, assuming things go well. Finally, if  volume  doesn't kick this reversal beyond the down  trend line , we'll see $5,800 and $5,500 as new bottom targets as we reach the bottom of the descending  wedge .

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 0.94% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)

After seemingly breaking down from the first  wedge  but not getting a big enough red candle to go with it I have readjusted the smaller green  rising wedge  to fit more of a traditional  bull flag  shape. Was also able to widen the larger purple  rising wedge  with the newer candles wicks to see that we are still very much inside the bigger  rising wedge . We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.  Current stochrsi, and  rsi  on the 4hr chart seem like  tey              are ready for an upward climb as well. All these things considered makes this idea a neutral one.

 BTC 0.94%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier. 

If you are taking a position - keep an eye on the charts and try to buy in the 6300 range - otherwise if you are holding - enjoy the show.

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 0.93%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 0.93%  that will already be created.

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 0.93%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin 0.93%  ( BTC 0.93% ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC 0.93%  is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC 0.93%  is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC 0.93%  risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 0.91% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)

After seemingly breaking down from the first  wedge  but not getting a big enough red candle to go with it I have readjusted the smaller green  rising wedge  to fit more of a traditional  bull flag  shape. Was also able to widen the larger purple  rising wedge  with the newer candles wicks to see that we are still very much inside the bigger  rising wedge . We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.  Current stochrsi, and  rsi  on the 4hr chart seem like  tey 1.95%  are ready for an upward climb as well. All these things considered makes this idea a neutral one.

 BTC 0.91%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier. 

If you are taking a position - keep an eye on the charts and try to buy in the 6300 range - otherwise if you are holding - enjoy the show.

 Bitcoin 0.91%  hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin 0.91%  has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 0.91%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 0.91%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000.

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin              ( BTC             ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC              is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC              is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC              risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line . 
If we fail to break out of the trend at $6,400, which I don't believe we would fail, we'll fall out of the descending  wedge  to $4,800 and $3,000. 

With lower  volume  comes more oblique angles in the reversals of price. These means less momentum/pressure to both the up and down side.

For this current wave, the resistances and fibonacci line up well with each other.  Elliot  waves can tell a rather predictable climb up, assuming things go well.

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 0.84% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)

After seemingly breaking down from the first  wedge  but not getting a big enough red candle to go with it I have readjusted the smaller green  rising wedge  to fit more of a traditional  bull flag  shape. Was also able to widen the larger purple  rising wedge  with the newer candles wicks to see that we are still very much inside the bigger  rising wedge . We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.  Current stochrsi, and  rsi  on the 4hr chart seem like  tey              are ready for an upward climb as well. All these things considered makes this idea a neutral one.

 BTC 0.81%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier. 

If you are taking a position - keep an eye on the charts and try to buy in the 6300 range - otherwise if you are holding - enjoy the show.

 Bitcoin 0.76%  hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin 0.76%  has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 0.76%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 0.76%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 0.76%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 0.76%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE.

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC 0.79%  is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC 0.79%  is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC 0.79%  risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

once again, the 4-hour candles has crossed the canal ceiling that was built seven months ago. But until now, the ceiling of the flag that was built 1 month ago has not been broken.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line . 
If we fail to break out of the trend at $6,400, which I don't believe we would fail, we'll fall out of the descending  wedge  to $4,800 and $3,000. 

With lower  volume  comes more oblique angles in the reversals of price. These means less momentum/pressure to both the up and down side. The first reversal line is almost vertical, the second at a 45 degree and the third even more shallow. We can expect the pattern to continue for the next waves. For this current wave, the resistances and fibonacci line up well with each other.  Elliot  waves can tell a rather predictable climb up, assuming things go well. Finally, if  volume  doesn't kick this reversal beyond the down  trend line , we'll see $5,800 and $5,500 as new bottom targets as we reach the bottom of the descending  wedge .

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 0.79% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)

After seemingly breaking down from the first  wedge  but not getting a big enough red candle to go with it I have readjusted the smaller green  rising wedge  to fit more of a traditional  bull flag  shape. Was also able to widen the larger purple  rising wedge  with the newer candles wicks to see that we are still very much inside the bigger  rising wedge . We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.  Current stochrsi, and  rsi  on the 4hr chart seem like  tey              are ready for an upward climb as well. All these things considered makes this idea a neutral one.

 BTC 0.79%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier. 

If you are taking a position - keep an eye on the charts and try to buy in the 6300 range - otherwise if you are holding - enjoy the show.

 Bitcoin 0.75%  hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin 0.75%  has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 0.75%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 0.75%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 0.75%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 0.75%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 0.75%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC              is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC              risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 0.76% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)  

About myself: Global citizen & early  Bitcoin 0.76%  adopter from Germany. I invested in the 2nd rally from 50 to 1.000 Dollars in  BTC 0.76%  .

After seemingly breaking down from the first  wedge  but not getting a big enough red candle to go with it I have readjusted the smaller green  rising wedge  to fit more of a traditional  bull flag  shape. Was also able to widen the larger purple  rising wedge  with the newer candles wicks to see that we are still very much inside the bigger  rising wedge . We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.

 BTC 0.77%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier.

 Bitcoin 0.75%  hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin 0.75%  has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 0.75%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 0.75%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 0.75%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 0.75%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 0.75%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin              ( BTC             ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC              is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.

-  BTC 0.13%  risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line . 
If we fail to break out of the trend at $6,400, which I don't believe we would fail, we'll fall out of the descending  wedge  to $4,800 and $3,000. 

With lower  volume  comes more oblique angles in the reversals of price. These means less momentum/pressure to both the up and down side. The first reversal line is almost vertical, the second at a 45 degree and the third even more shallow. We can expect the pattern to continue for the next waves. For this current wave, the resistances and fibonacci line up well with each other.  Elliot  waves can tell a rather predictable climb up, assuming things go well. Finally, if  volume  doesn't kick this reversal beyond the down  trend line , we'll see $5,800 and $5,500 as new bottom targets as we reach the bottom of the descending  wedge .

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin             , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)

After seemingly breaking down from the first  wedge  but not getting a big enough red candle to go with it I have readjusted the smaller green  rising wedge  to fit more of a traditional  bull flag  shape. Was also able to widen the larger purple  rising wedge  with the newer candles wicks to see that we are still very much inside the bigger  rising wedge . We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.  Current stochrsi, and  rsi  on the 4hr chart seem like  tey              are ready for an upward climb as well. All these things considered makes this idea a neutral one.

 BTC 0.22%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier. 

If you are taking a position - keep an eye on the charts and try to buy in the 6300 range - otherwise if you are holding - enjoy the show.

 Bitcoin              hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin              has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin              and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin              and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN              REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins              that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin              price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin              ( BTC             ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC              is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC              is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC              risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line .

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 0.28% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)  

About myself: Global citizen & early  Bitcoin 0.28%  adopter from Germany. I invested in the 2nd rally from 50 to 1.000 Dollars in  BTC 0.28%  .

After seemingly breaking down from the first  wedge  but not getting a big enough red candle to go with it I have readjusted the smaller green  rising wedge  to fit more of a traditional  bull flag  shape. Was also able to widen the larger purple  rising wedge  with the newer candles wicks to see that we are still very much inside the bigger  rising wedge . We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.  Current stochrsi, and  rsi  on the 4hr chart seem like  tey              are ready for an upward climb as well. All these things considered makes this idea a neutral one.

 BTC 0.28%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier. 

If you are taking a position - keep an eye on the charts and try to buy in the 6300 range - otherwise if you are holding - enjoy the show.

 Bitcoin 0.37%  hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin 0.37%  has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 0.37%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 0.37%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 0.37%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 0.37%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 0.37%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin              ( BTC             ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC              is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC              is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC              risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 0.32% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)  

About myself: Global citizen & early  Bitcoin 0.32%  adopter from Germany. I invested in the 2nd rally from 50 to 1.000 Dollars in  BTC 0.32%  .

We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.

 BTC 0.32%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier. 

If you are taking a position - keep an eye on the charts and try to buy in the 6300 range - otherwise if you are holding - enjoy the show.

 Bitcoin 0.32%  hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin 0.32%  has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 0.32%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 0.32%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 0.32%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 0.32%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 0.32%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin 0.32%  ( BTC 0.32% ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC 0.32%  is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC 0.32%  is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC 0.32%  risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 0.36% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)  

About myself: Global citizen & early  Bitcoin 0.36%  adopter from Germany. I invested in the 2nd rally from 50 to 1.000 Dollars in  BTC 0.36%  .

After seemingly breaking down from the first  wedge  but not getting a big enough red candle to go with it I have readjusted the smaller green  rising wedge  to fit more of a traditional  bull flag  shape. Was also able to widen the larger purple  rising wedge  with the newer candles wicks to see that we are still very much inside the bigger  rising wedge . We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.  Current stochrsi, and  rsi  on the 4hr chart seem like  tey              are ready for an upward climb as well. All these things considered makes this idea a neutral one.

 BTC 0.36%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier. 

If you are taking a position - keep an eye on the charts and try to buy in the 6300 range - otherwise if you are holding - enjoy the show.

 Bitcoin 0.37%  hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin 0.37%  has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 0.37%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 0.37%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 0.37%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 0.37%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 0.37%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin 0.36%  ( BTC 0.36% ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC 0.36%  is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC 0.36%  is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC 0.36%  risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line . 
If we fail to break out of the trend at $6,400, which I don't believe we would fail, we'll fall out of the descending  wedge  to $4,800 and $3,000. 

With lower  volume  comes more oblique angles in the reversals of price. These means less momentum/pressure to both the up and down side. The first reversal line is almost vertical, the second at a 45 degree and the third even more shallow. We can expect the pattern to continue for the next waves. For this current wave, the resistances and fibonacci line up well with each other.  Elliot  waves can tell a rather predictable climb up, assuming things go well. Finally, if  volume  doesn't kick this reversal beyond the down  trend line , we'll see $5,800 and $5,500 as new bottom targets as we reach the bottom of the descending  wedge .

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 0.36% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)  

About myself: Global citizen & early  Bitcoin 0.36%  adopter from Germany. I invested in the 2nd rally from 50 to 1.000 Dollars in  BTC 0.36%  .

After seemingly breaking down from the first  wedge  but not getting a big enough red candle to go with it I have readjusted the smaller green  rising wedge  to fit more of a traditional  bull flag  shape. Was also able to widen the larger purple  rising wedge  with the newer candles wicks to see that we are still very much inside the bigger  rising wedge . We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.  Current stochrsi, and  rsi  on the 4hr chart seem like  tey 1.95%  are ready for an upward climb as well. All these things considered makes this idea a neutral one.

 BTC 0.36%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier. 

If you are taking a position - keep an eye on the charts and try to buy in the 6300 range - otherwise if you are holding - enjoy the show.

 Bitcoin 0.36%  hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin 0.36%  has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 0.36%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 0.36%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 0.36%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 0.36%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 0.36%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin 0.36%  ( BTC 0.36% ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC 0.36%  is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC 0.36%  is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC 0.36%  risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line . 
If we fail to break out of the trend at $6,400, which I don't believe we would fail, we'll fall out of the descending  wedge  to $4,800 and $3,000. 

With lower  volume  comes more oblique angles in the reversals of price. These means less momentum/pressure to both the up and down side. The first reversal line is almost vertical, the second at a 45 degree and the third even more shallow. We can expect the pattern to continue for the next waves. For this current wave, the resistances and fibonacci line up well with each other.  Elliot  waves can tell a rather predictable climb up, assuming things go well. Finally, if  volume  doesn't kick this reversal beyond the down  trend line , we'll see $5,800 and $5,500 as new bottom targets as we reach the bottom of the descending  wedge .

 BTC 0.36%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier.

 Bitcoin 0.45%  hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin 0.45%  has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 0.45%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 0.45%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 0.45%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 0.45%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 0.45%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin              ( BTC             ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC              is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC              is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC              risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line . 
If we fail to break out of the trend at $6,400, which I don't believe we would fail, we'll fall out of the descending  wedge  to $4,800 and $3,000. 

With lower  volume  comes more oblique angles in the reversals of price. These means less momentum/pressure to both the up and down side. The first reversal line is almost vertical, the second at a 45 degree and the third even more shallow. We can expect the pattern to continue for the next waves. For this current wave, the resistances and fibonacci line up well with each other.  Elliot  waves can tell a rather predictable climb up, assuming things go well. Finally, if  volume  doesn't kick this reversal beyond the down  trend line , we'll see $5,800 and $5,500 as new bottom targets as we reach the bottom of the descending  wedge .

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 0.37% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.

 BTC 0.39%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier.

 Bitcoin 0.39%  hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin 0.39%  has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 0.39%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 0.39%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 0.39%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 0.39%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 0.39%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin 0.37%  ( BTC 0.37% ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC 0.37%  is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC 0.37%  is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC 0.37%  risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line . 
If we fail to break out of the trend at $6,400, which I don't believe we would fail, we'll fall out of the descending  wedge  to $4,800 and $3,000. 

With lower  volume  comes more oblique angles in the reversals of price. These means less momentum/pressure to both the up and down side. The first reversal line is almost vertical, the second at a 45 degree and the third even more shallow. We can expect the pattern to continue for the next waves. For this current wave, the resistances and fibonacci line up well with each other.  Elliot  waves can tell a rather predictable climb up, assuming things go well. Finally, if  volume  doesn't kick this reversal beyond the down  trend line , we'll see $5,800 and $5,500 as new bottom targets as we reach the bottom of the descending  wedge .

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 0.30% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier. 

If you are taking a position - keep an eye on the charts and try to buy in the 6300 range - otherwise if you are holding - enjoy the show.

 Bitcoin 0.30%  hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin 0.30%  has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 0.30%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 0.30%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 0.30%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 0.30%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 0.30%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin              ( BTC             ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC              is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC              is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC              risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line . 
If we fail to break out of the trend at $6,400, which I don't believe we would fail, we'll fall out of the descending  wedge  to $4,800 and $3,000. 

With lower  volume  comes more oblique angles in the reversals of price. These means less momentum/pressure to both the up and down side. The first reversal line is almost vertical, the second at a 45 degree and the third even more shallow. We can expect the pattern to continue for the next waves. For this current wave, the resistances and fibonacci line up well with each other.  Elliot  waves can tell a rather predictable climb up, assuming things go well. Finally, if  volume  doesn't kick this reversal beyond the down  trend line , we'll see $5,800 and $5,500 as new bottom targets as we reach the bottom of the descending  wedge .

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 0.31% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)

After seemingly breaking down from the first  wedge  but not getting a big enough red candle to go with it I have readjusted the smaller green  rising wedge  to fit more of a traditional  bull flag  shape. Was also able to widen the larger purple  rising wedge  with the newer candles wicks to see that we are still very much inside the bigger  rising wedge . We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.  Current stochrsi, and  rsi  on the 4hr chart seem like  tey 1.95%  are ready for an upward climb as well. All these things considered makes this idea a neutral one.

 Bitcoin 0.50%  hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin 0.50%  has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 0.50%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 0.50%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 0.50%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 0.50%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 0.50%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin              ( BTC             ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC              is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC              is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC              risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line . 
If we fail to break out of the trend at $6,400, which I don't believe we would fail, we'll fall out of the descending  wedge  to $4,800 and $3,000. 

With lower  volume  comes more oblique angles in the reversals of price. These means less momentum/pressure to both the up and down side. The first reversal line is almost vertical, the second at a 45 degree and the third even more shallow. We can expect the pattern to continue for the next waves. For this current wave, the resistances and fibonacci line up well with each other.  Elliot  waves can tell a rather predictable climb up, assuming things go well. Finally, if  volume  doesn't kick this reversal beyond the down  trend line , we'll see $5,800 and $5,500 as new bottom targets as we reach the bottom of the descending  wedge .

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin             , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)

After seemingly breaking down from the first  wedge  but not getting a big enough red candle to go with it I have readjusted the smaller green  rising wedge  to fit more of a traditional  bull flag  shape. Was also able to widen the larger purple  rising wedge  with the newer candles wicks to see that we are still very much inside the bigger  rising wedge . We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.  Current stochrsi, and  rsi  on the 4hr chart seem like  tey              are ready for an upward climb as well. All these things considered makes this idea a neutral one.

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier. 

If you are taking a position - keep an eye on the charts and try to buy in the 6300 range - otherwise if you are holding - enjoy the show.

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 0.39%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 0.39%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 0.39%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 0.39%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 0.39%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin              ( BTC             ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC              is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC              is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC              risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line . 
If we fail to break out of the trend at $6,400, which I don't believe we would fail, we'll fall out of the descending  wedge  to $4,800 and $3,000. 

With lower  volume  comes more oblique angles in the reversals of price. These means less momentum/pressure to both the up and down side. The first reversal line is almost vertical, the second at a 45 degree and the third even more shallow. We can expect the pattern to continue for the next waves. For this current wave, the resistances and fibonacci line up well with each other.  Elliot  waves can tell a rather predictable climb up, assuming things go well. Finally, if  volume  doesn't kick this reversal beyond the down  trend line , we'll see $5,800 and $5,500 as new bottom targets as we reach the bottom of the descending  wedge .

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 0.29% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)

We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.

 BTC 0.29%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier. 

If you are taking a position - keep an eye on the charts and try to buy in the 6300 range - otherwise if you are holding - enjoy the show.

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 0.33%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 0.33%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 0.33%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin 0.33%  ( BTC 0.33% ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC 0.33%  is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC 0.33%  is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC 0.33%  risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 0.33% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)

After seemingly breaking down from the first  wedge  but not getting a big enough red candle to go with it I have readjusted the smaller green  rising wedge  to fit more of a traditional  bull flag  shape. Was also able to widen the larger purple  rising wedge  with the newer candles wicks to see that we are still very much inside the bigger  rising wedge . We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.  Current stochrsi, and  rsi  on the 4hr chart seem like  tey              are ready for an upward climb as well. All these things considered makes this idea a neutral one.

 BTC 0.33%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier. 

If you are taking a position - keep an eye on the charts and try to buy in the 6300 range - otherwise if you are holding - enjoy the show.

 Bitcoin 0.34%  hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin 0.34%  has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 0.34%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 0.34%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000.

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN              REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins              that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin              price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin 0.46%  ( BTC 0.46% ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC 0.46%  is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC 0.46%  is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC 0.46%  risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 0.46% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)

Was also able to widen the larger purple  rising wedge  with the newer candles wicks to see that we are still very much inside the bigger  rising wedge . We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.

 BTC 0.45%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier. 

If you are taking a position - keep an eye on the charts and try to buy in the 6300 range - otherwise if you are holding - enjoy the show.

 Bitcoin 0.47%  hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin 0.47%  has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 0.47%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 0.47%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. ""

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 0.51%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 0.51%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 0.51%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin              ( BTC             ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC              is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC              is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC              risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line . 
If we fail to break out of the trend at $6,400, which I don't believe we would fail, we'll fall out of the descending  wedge  to $4,800 and $3,000. 

With lower  volume  comes more oblique angles in the reversals of price. These means less momentum/pressure to both the up and down side. The first reversal line is almost vertical, the second at a 45 degree and the third even more shallow. We can expect the pattern to continue for the next waves. For this current wave, the resistances and fibonacci line up well with each other.  Elliot  waves can tell a rather predictable climb up, assuming things go well. Finally, if  volume  doesn't kick this reversal beyond the down  trend line , we'll see $5,800 and $5,500 as new bottom targets as we reach the bottom of the descending  wedge .

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 0.51% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)

After seemingly breaking down from the first  wedge  but not getting a big enough red candle to go with it I have readjusted the smaller green  rising wedge  to fit more of a traditional  bull flag  shape. Was also able to widen the larger purple  rising wedge  with the newer candles wicks to see that we are still very much inside the bigger  rising wedge . We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.  Current stochrsi, and  rsi  on the 4hr chart seem like  tey              are ready for an upward climb as well. All these things considered makes this idea a neutral one.

 BTC 0.51%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier. 

If you are taking a position - keep an eye on the charts and try to buy in the 6300 range - otherwise if you are holding - enjoy the show.

 Bitcoin 0.52%  hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin 0.52%  has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 0.52%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 0.52%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. ""

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 0.52%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 0.52%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 0.52%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin 0.52%  ( BTC 0.52% ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC 0.52%  is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC 0.52%  is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC 0.52%  risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line . 
If we fail to break out of the trend at $6,400, which I don't believe we would fail, we'll fall out of the descending  wedge  to $4,800 and $3,000.

For this current wave, the resistances and fibonacci line up well with each other.  Elliot  waves can tell a rather predictable climb up, assuming things go well. Finally, if  volume  doesn't kick this reversal beyond the down  trend line , we'll see $5,800 and $5,500 as new bottom targets as we reach the bottom of the descending  wedge .

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 0.52% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)

After seemingly breaking down from the first  wedge  but not getting a big enough red candle to go with it I have readjusted the smaller green  rising wedge  to fit more of a traditional  bull flag  shape. Was also able to widen the larger purple  rising wedge  with the newer candles wicks to see that we are still very much inside the bigger  rising wedge . We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.

 BTC 0.52%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier. 

If you are taking a position - keep an eye on the charts and try to buy in the 6300 range - otherwise if you are holding - enjoy the show.

 Bitcoin 0.52%  hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin 0.52%  has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 0.52%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 0.52%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000.

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 0.52%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 0.52%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 0.52%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin 0.50%  ( BTC 0.50% ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC 0.50%  is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC 0.50%  is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC 0.50%  risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line . 
If we fail to break out of the trend at $6,400, which I don't believe we would fail, we'll fall out of the descending  wedge  to $4,800 and $3,000. 

With lower  volume  comes more oblique angles in the reversals of price. These means less momentum/pressure to both the up and down side. The first reversal line is almost vertical, the second at a 45 degree and the third even more shallow. We can expect the pattern to continue for the next waves. For this current wave, the resistances and fibonacci line up well with each other.  Elliot  waves can tell a rather predictable climb up, assuming things go well. Finally, if  volume  doesn't kick this reversal beyond the down  trend line , we'll see $5,800 and $5,500 as new bottom targets as we reach the bottom of the descending  wedge .

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 0.50% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)

After seemingly breaking down from the first  wedge  but not getting a big enough red candle to go with it I have readjusted the smaller green  rising wedge  to fit more of a traditional  bull flag  shape. Was also able to widen the larger purple  rising wedge  with the newer candles wicks to see that we are still very much inside the bigger  rising wedge . We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.

 BTC 0.50%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier. 

If you are taking a position - keep an eye on the charts and try to buy in the 6300 range - otherwise if you are holding - enjoy the show.

 Bitcoin 0.50%  hit $ 5,800 and $ 6,000 last week and is currently moving toward $ 7,000. 

The world's largest crypto-currency in market value continues to be pushed to the downside in 2018, but a longer term provides a different story for investors and analysts.  Bitcoin 0.50%  has been trading more than twice its value exactly a year ago, when it was worth $ 2,577. 

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 0.50%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 0.50%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000.

Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 0.49%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 0.49%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 0.49%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin              ( BTC             ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC              is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC              is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC              risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line . 
If we fail to break out of the trend at $6,400, which I don't believe we would fail, we'll fall out of the descending  wedge  to $4,800 and $3,000. 

With lower  volume  comes more oblique angles in the reversals of price. These means less momentum/pressure to both the up and down side. The first reversal line is almost vertical, the second at a 45 degree and the third even more shallow. We can expect the pattern to continue for the next waves. For this current wave, the resistances and fibonacci line up well with each other.  Elliot  waves can tell a rather predictable climb up, assuming things go well. Finally, if  volume  doesn't kick this reversal beyond the down  trend line , we'll see $5,800 and $5,500 as new bottom targets as we reach the bottom of the descending  wedge .

Helloo guys, hope you're doing fine. We now have the second Daily  inside bar  for grandpa  Bitcoin 0.49% , which equals an equilibrium pattern on shorter time frames like the 4H & 1H. We have our 4H Lower Highs of 6700 as resistance, and 6400 with  double bottom  as support.  

=> A break here is coming sooner than later. I will be talking about this in today's episode of the 'Crypto Chart Analysis', make sure to watch it! ;)  

All in all, the bulls have maintained 4H EMAs as support, and are exactly between Daily 12 & 26, in a nice consolidation over the last few days. This gives them enough power to break  bullish  , but of course, the market in the end decides. If we look at the nephews like IOTA or EOS: those were much weaker already, so not a good indication on that front.  

If we manage to stay in the 4H equilibrium/Daily  inside bar  , I think a break should be coming this weekend. I wish you a good trading! ;) No matter what you do: set your stop loss & beware of fake-outs.  

If you had some value from my analysis, please like & subscribe, I will be doing those daily from now on! ;)

After seemingly breaking down from the first  wedge  but not getting a big enough red candle to go with it I have readjusted the smaller green  rising wedge  to fit more of a traditional  bull flag  shape. Was also able to widen the larger purple  rising wedge  with the newer candles wicks to see that we are still very much inside the bigger  rising wedge . We could essentially however stay inside the bigger  wedge  and trigger an inverted head and shoulder pattern for a  bullish  break upward before we break downward out of the larger  wedge . If hat were to happen it may allow us to avoid breaking downward from the bigger lavender  rising wedge  all together.  Current stochrsi, and  rsi  on the 4hr chart seem like  tey              are ready for an upward climb as well. All these things considered makes this idea a neutral one.

 BTC 0.49%  continues to trace what appears to be an  H&S  pattern. 

We are currently working on the right side of the pattern which means we will likely see a push to the 6600's before a drop to the 6300's where we should bounce back up through 6400 and 6800 in a more convincing manner. 

The right side hasn't completed yet so this is still unconfirmed.  What we can say is we are still struggling to get about 6800 and we seem to have enough support right now keeping us above 6200. 

Weekend trading has a tendency to be unpredictable but I expect the right shoulder to finish and a bounce at the 6300 level this weekend - possibly today - which should give us a much better chance at breaking through the 6800 and onto the 7200 barrier. 

If you are taking a position - keep an eye on the charts and try to buy in the 6300 range - otherwise if you are holding - enjoy the show.

Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street analyst to issue price forecasts for  Bitcoin 0.49%  and founder of Fundstrat, takes into account the whole history of  Bitcoin 0.49%  and the latest developments when it updates its target price forecast for the cryptomeo, which before was $ 25,000. Lee told CNBC on Thursday, July 5, that he calculated a new target for the price of the digital currency by the end of the year, now being $ 20,000. 

""BITCOIN HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY TRADED 2.5 TIMES OF ITS MINING COSTS. IT IS NOT OUTSIDE ANY ISSUE THAT YOU CAN REACH MORE THAN $ 20,000 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AT A FAIR VALUE. "" 

Tom Lee Lee, former chief stock strategist at JPMorgan, also pointed out that the new price target is about 200% higher than the current price, which is around $ 6,750. 

""THE REASON FOR WHAT  BITCOIN 0.49%  REALLY REALLY GOOD IS THE COST OF MINING AROUND $ 7,000 TOTALLY LOADED. AND DIFFICULTY IS INCREASING. THEN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, THERE WILL BE $ 9,000. "" 

Cryptomanne miners have already issued about 80% of the 21 million  Bitcoins 0.49%  that will already be created. Fundstrat's chief strategist explained that distributed accounting technology is a multidisciplinary story in its early stages, like many other technologies that preceded the blockchain. 

""I DID WIRELESS IN THE 90'S. I SAW 20 YEARS OF MOBILE CONVERGENCE AND INTERNET. TO ME, THIS IS NOT SO DIFFERENT, ""SAYS LEE. 

Tom Lee first issued a forecast of $ 25,000 for the  Bitcoin 0.49%  price in September 2017. The digital asset, which accounts for 42.1% of the entire crypto-coin market, according to the CoinMarketCap tool, rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the  bullish  momentum reached the mark of US $ 20,000 

In May 2018, the analyst said: ""The change from $ 8,000 to $ 25,000  happen in a few days.""

1530893919.0,CryptoMetaTrader,Bitcoin Awaits Price Breakout As Trading Range Tightens,"
The price of  bitcoin              ( BTC             ) is stuck in a $400 range defined by key technical levels, and the direction of the breakout will likely set the tone for the next move in the cryptocurrency.  

The trading range's lower end is $6,341, a  double bottom  neckline (former resistance-turned-support), which was scaled on June 30. Meanwhile, $6,754 (a 23.6 percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the sell-off from $9,990 to $5,755), which put brakes on BTC's rally earlier this week, marks the upper end of the trading range. 

A convincing move above $6,754 would signal a resumption of the rally from $5,755 (June 24 low) and would open the doors to $7,000, as indicated by the  double bottom  breakout and  bull flag  breakout earlier this week. 

On the other hand, the  bullish  case would weaken significantly if prices find acceptance below $6,341. 

That said, the short duration charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a downside break of the trading range. At press time,  BTC              is changing hands at $6,520 on Bitfinex - down 1 percent on a 24-hour basis.  

The bears may feel emboldened by BTC's transition from  rising channel  ( bullish  setup) to  falling channel  ( bearish  setup), as seen in the chart above. 

Further,  Bollinger Bands  (standard deviation of +2,-2 on 20-hour moving average) are trending south, indicating a  bearish  setup. 

BTC              is also trading below 50-hour and 100-hour moving average (MA), indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. More importantly, 50-hour MA risks falling below 100-hour MA in the next few hours ( bearish  crossover).  

The downside break of the  rising channel  yesterday added credence to the  bearish relative strength index  ( RSI ) divergence and strengthened the bear case. 

The chart also shows  Bollinger Bands  that have adopted  bearish  bias (beginning to fall). 

So, let's sum up: 

-  BTC              risks falling below $6,341 ( double bottom  neckline - former resistance-turned-support, the lower end of the trading range) as indicated by the  bearish  setup on the hourly and 4-hour chart. 
- Acceptance below $6,341 would abort the  bullish  view put forward by the  double bottom  breakout,  bull flag  breakout and  bullish falling channel  breakout and would shift risk in favor of a drop below $6,000. 
- On the higher side, an aggressive move above the significant obstacle of $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci resistance) would bolster the already  bullish  technical setup on the  daily chart  and open doors to $7,000.

In the 2 hour indicator, the cross has happened. Although this sign is not enough to climb, it is at least indicative of a short ascent. 
once again, the 4-hour candles has crossed the canal ceiling that was built seven months ago. But until now, the ceiling of the flag that was built 1 month ago has not been broken. 
As long as the market stabilizes, I propose that you keep the stop loss.

Either we'll have enough buy pressure to breakout of the downtrend/descending  wedge , OR, we'll move down to $5,500 before rebounding to meet the  trend line . 
If we fail to break out of the trend at $6,400, which I don't believe we would fail, we'll fall out of the descending  wedge  to $4,800 and $3,000. 

With lower  volume  comes more oblique angles in the reversals of price. These means less momentum/pressure to both the up and down side. The first reversal line is almost vertical, the second at a 45 degree and the third even more shallow. We can expect the pattern to continue for the next waves. For this current wave, the resistances and fibonacci line up well with each other.  Elliot  waves can tell a rather predictable climb up, assuming things go well. Finally, if  volume  doesn't kick this reversal beyond the down  trend line , we'll see $5,800 and $5,500 as new bottom targets as we reach the bottom of the descending  wedge .
