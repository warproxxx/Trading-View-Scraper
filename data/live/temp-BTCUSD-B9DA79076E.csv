On the weekly we have a clear visual of looming doom of the MAs, if it break down from here. IÂ´m cheering for 6,8k which averts the danger.

A  bullish divergence  on  bitcoin 0.87% , a high probability of finding it at 10000 and maybe at 12000 if it breaks the 7000 
if it consolidates in area 7000 and 6000, it has a high probability of finding it less than 6000.

1530879832.0,real_markimark,BITCOIN: 48h pump pattern | price manipulation at its finest!,"
hi there.. i just have to upload this. Another great example how this market is played by big whales and cartels. Its sad to see that only like 3000 BTC's can influence the total mcap and price of  bitcoin 0.87%  this easily. 

If in the coming 60 mins another pump appears.. we would have an exact 48h pump pattern since 6 days straight. Still we need to break 6800 and build a new floor above this to break 7200$ with enough  volume  (green line from falling grand  wedge ).  RSI  should stay above 45. 

Play the waves.. stay save.. 

Cheers
