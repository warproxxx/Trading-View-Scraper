1530163071.0,CryptoComes,XRP/USD Remains Neutral,"
Ripple has added almost two percent in the past 24 hours, but still looks neutral as the price is within the range without any direction. The price is above the descending  trend line  meaning bulls have chances to change the situation in the nearest future. 

When we look closer at the situation on the Hourly chart we can see that Ripple is trying to test the  resistance area  at $0.4744, but still in vain as the price retreats from this level. Even though Ripple looks  bullish  now, it has to jump over this resistance in order to develop its upside progress. The possible scenarios for XRP/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). The currency pair will move towards the closest support to test it. If bears are able to move below $0.4495, they will develop their downside progress. 
2.	Orange scenario (neutral). This one is the most likely for Thursday as we think the price will stay within the current range without significant changes. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). Ripple will jump over the resistance at $0.4744 to move higher targeting the next resistance at $0.4918.
