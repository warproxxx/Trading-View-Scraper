1530800606.0,Quantamize,Ethereum Transaction Costs Spike - ETH AI/ML Signal,"
o	Transaction costs for  Ethereum 0.88%  have been much higher than usual over the past few days. It is reported that miners have been collecting 10x more fees than average over the past 5 days. It is reported that this increase is caused by a cryptocurrency exchange China, FCoin, which has inappropriately incentivized users to deposit tokens. As a result, there has been an influx of ERC20 tokens. The reason for the deposits is because FCoin is letting users vote via depositing tokens for its next cryptocurrency listing. The exchange’s voting process is a cumulative deposit number ranking process where each deposit of a token counts as a vote towards the listing. Blockchain data from ‘Gaz Guzzlers’ section of EtherScan allegedly show a correlation between the top voted tokens on FCoin and the ‘Gaz Guzzlers’. The gas prices, which are usually 5 Gwei, have risen to 50 Gwei because users on the  Ethereum 0.88%  network have brought their transactions to the front of the pending transaction line. This has raised the average fee from USD$.20 to USD$3.50 within 48 hours.
