Everybody is looking for the sweet spot where  Bitcoin              will reverse for good and start climbing to higher levels. Ideally in order to have a clear view for that, we better focus at the higher timeframes to get the bigger picture. For now, we are clearly in a bear market and trading it short term is absolutely ok.  

Looking at the hourly chart of  Bitcoin              we may see that price is forming a  H&S  pattern after bouncing from a key  structure resistance  level. Selling at the level of the left shoulder at around $6250 with a stoploss above $6350 is a nice idea. As for tp $5780 (previous lows) looks like a realistic level.

HI Friends, 

We can clearly see a  falling wedge  with higher highs.  

In a weekly chart, buying pressure is increasing as we can see that candle's size is getting smaller. I am anticipated a nice rally soon. 

Lets wait for the candle to close out of the  falling wedge  to get the confirmation of a  bullish trend . We then can  start trading. 

Thank you

Posting a quick  daily analysis , as I am currently in the process of moving house so I have been very busy. 

Bitcoin 0.66%  is currently trading at a horizontal  support zone  between 6040 and 5930. Price could either bounce up from here to the highs, or break the horizontal  support zone  and break lower. 

Now, for this next part I recommend you read my previous  Bitcoin 0.66%  analysis as this part is more difficult... (See related ideas below this analysis)... If  Bitcoin 0.66%  trades upwards now, it is likely only going to be short lived. As per my previous analysis, price is still in a long term  bearish flag  pattern and this measure move target has still not been achieved yet.  

Now, this level has to be reached in my opinion. I believe regardless of if price holds at 6040 and 5930, it will have to eventually come down and satisfy the  flag pattern . For this reason, we should watch Bitcoin's behavior in the short term to attempt to profit from small moves during this market correction. 

Bear in mind that price does NOT HAVE TO STAY BEYOND THE SUPPORT BETWEEN 6040 AN 5930. This is just a level that price MIGHT stop to get some upside before the ultimate downside takes over.

Look at the red lines and the black lines 

Wanted to play a bit with the range bars, guess you all saw it as what is new on  TD 0.28% . 

Red line was when we had our correction pattern... Now we are in a simple and quite obvious  Elliott wave  pattern. The next tick will happen in the zone of the red arrow (54-55-56 zone). Expect a strong bounce to the 5900--6200 after and then we should normally go have our final dive to the dept of panic. And bots that will just start panic selling. The bad thing about bots, is that they have very very simple coding...Even those they call Ai bots, are first not AI bots, but use narrow artificial intelligence, and are really good at performing that one single task they where programmed for.  
This is going to be fun!!

Look at the red lines and the black lines 

Wanted to play a bit with the range bars, guess you all saw it as what is new on  TD             . 

Red line was when we had our correction pattern... Now we are in a simple and quite obvious  Elliott wave  pattern. The next tick will happen in the zone of the red arrow (54-55-56 zone). Expect a strong bounce to the 5900--6200 after and then we should normally go have our final dive to the dept of panic. And bots that will just start panic selling. The bad thing about bots, is that they have very very simple coding...Even those they call Ai bots, are first not AI bots, but use narrow artificial intelligence, and are really good at performing that one single task they where programmed for.

Everybody is looking for the sweet spot where  Bitcoin 0.60%  will reverse for good and start climbing to higher levels. Ideally in order to have a clear view for that, we better focus at the higher timeframes to get the bigger picture. For now, we are clearly in a bear market and trading it short term is absolutely ok.  

Looking at the hourly chart of  Bitcoin 0.60%  we may see that price is forming a  H&S  pattern after bouncing from a key  structure resistance  level. Selling at the level of the left shoulder at around $6250 with a stoploss above $6350 is a nice idea. As for tp $5780 (previous lows) looks like a realistic level.

HI Friends, 

We can clearly see a  falling wedge  with higher highs.  

In a weekly chart, buying pressure is increasing as we can see that candle's size is getting smaller. I am anticipated a nice rally soon. 

Lets wait for the candle to close out of the  falling wedge  to get the confirmation of a  bullish trend . We then can  start trading. 

Thank you

Posting a quick  daily analysis , as I am currently in the process of moving house so I have been very busy. 

Bitcoin 0.60%  is currently trading at a horizontal  support zone  between 6040 and 5930. Price could either bounce up from here to the highs, or break the horizontal  support zone  and break lower. 

Now, for this next part I recommend you read my previous  Bitcoin 0.60%  analysis as this part is more difficult... (See related ideas below this analysis)... If  Bitcoin 0.60%  trades upwards now, it is likely only going to be short lived. As per my previous analysis, price is still in a long term  bearish flag  pattern and this measure move target has still not been achieved yet.  

Now, this level has to be reached in my opinion. I believe regardless of if price holds at 6040 and 5930, it will have to eventually come down and satisfy the  flag pattern . For this reason, we should watch Bitcoin's behavior in the short term to attempt to profit from small moves during this market correction. 

Bear in mind that price does NOT HAVE TO STAY BEYOND THE SUPPORT BETWEEN 6040 AN 5930. This is just a level that price MIGHT stop to get some upside before the ultimate downside takes over.

Posting a quick  daily analysis , as I am currently in the process of moving house so I have been very busy. 

Bitcoin 0.60%  is currently trading at a horizontal  support zone  between 6040 and 5930. Price could either bounce up from here to the highs, or break the horizontal  support zone  and break lower. 

Now, for this next part I recommend you read my previous  Bitcoin 0.60%  analysis as this part is more difficult... (See related ideas below this analysis)... If  Bitcoin 0.60%  trades upwards now, it is likely only going to be short lived. As per my previous analysis, price is still in a long term  bearish flag  pattern and this measure move target has still not been achieved yet.  

Now, this level has to be reached in my opinion. I believe regardless of if price holds at 6040 and 5930, it will have to eventually come down and satisfy the  flag pattern . For this reason, we should watch Bitcoin's behavior in the short term to attempt to profit from small moves during this market correction. 

Bear in mind that price does NOT HAVE TO STAY BEYOND THE SUPPORT BETWEEN 6040 AN 5930. This is just a level that price MIGHT stop to get some upside before the ultimate downside takes over.

Look at the red lines and the black lines 

Wanted to play a bit with the range bars, guess you all saw it as what is new on  TD 0.28% . 

Red line was when we had our correction pattern... Now we are in a simple and quite obvious  Elliott wave  pattern. The next tick will happen in the zone of the red arrow (54-55-56 zone). Expect a strong bounce to the 5900--6200 after and then we should normally go have our final dive to the dept of panic. And bots that will just start panic selling. The bad thing about bots, is that they have very very simple coding...Even those they call Ai bots, are first not AI bots, but use narrow artificial intelligence, and are really good at performing that one single task they where programmed for.

Everybody is looking for the sweet spot where  Bitcoin 0.60%  will reverse for good and start climbing to higher levels. Ideally in order to have a clear view for that, we better focus at the higher timeframes to get the bigger picture. For now, we are clearly in a bear market and trading it short term is absolutely ok.  

Looking at the hourly chart of  Bitcoin 0.60%  we may see that price is forming a  H&S  pattern after bouncing from a key  structure resistance  level. Selling at the level of the left shoulder at around $6250 with a stoploss above $6350 is a nice idea. As for tp $5780 (previous lows) looks like a realistic level.

HI Friends, 

We can clearly see a  falling wedge  with higher highs.  

In a weekly chart, buying pressure is increasing as we can see that candle's size is getting smaller. I am anticipated a nice rally soon. 

Lets wait for the candle to close out of the  falling wedge  to get the confirmation of a  bullish trend . We then can  start trading. 

Thank you

Posting a quick  daily analysis , as I am currently in the process of moving house so I have been very busy. 

Bitcoin              is currently trading at a horizontal  support zone  between 6040 and 5930. Price could either bounce up from here to the highs, or break the horizontal  support zone  and break lower. 

Now, for this next part I recommend you read my previous  Bitcoin              analysis as this part is more difficult... (See related ideas below this analysis)... If  Bitcoin              trades upwards now, it is likely only going to be short lived. As per my previous analysis, price is still in a long term  bearish flag  pattern and this measure move target has still not been achieved yet.  

Now, this level has to be reached in my opinion. I believe regardless of if price holds at 6040 and 5930, it will have to eventually come down and satisfy the  flag pattern . For this reason, we should watch Bitcoin's behavior in the short term to attempt to profit from small moves during this market correction. 

Bear in mind that price does NOT HAVE TO STAY BEYOND THE SUPPORT BETWEEN 6040 AN 5930. This is just a level that price MIGHT stop to get some upside before the ultimate downside takes over.

Look at the red lines and the black lines 

Wanted to play a bit with the range bars, guess you all saw it as what is new on  TD             . 

Red line was when we had our correction pattern... Now we are in a simple and quite obvious  Elliott wave  pattern. The next tick will happen in the zone of the red arrow (54-55-56 zone). Expect a strong bounce to the 5900--6200 after and then we should normally go have our final dive to the dept of panic. And bots that will just start panic selling. The bad thing about bots, is that they have very very simple coding...Even those they call Ai bots, are first not AI bots, but use narrow artificial intelligence, and are really good at performing that one single task they where programmed for.

HI Friends, 

We can clearly see a  falling wedge  with higher highs.  

In a weekly chart, buying pressure is increasing as we can see that candle's size is getting smaller. I am anticipated a nice rally soon. 

Lets wait for the candle to close out of the  falling wedge  to get the confirmation of a  bullish trend . We then can  start trading. 

Thank you

Posting a quick  daily analysis , as I am currently in the process of moving house so I have been very busy. 

Bitcoin 0.61%  is currently trading at a horizontal  support zone  between 6040 and 5930. Price could either bounce up from here to the highs, or break the horizontal  support zone  and break lower. 

Now, for this next part I recommend you read my previous  Bitcoin 0.61%  analysis as this part is more difficult... (See related ideas below this analysis)... If  Bitcoin 0.61%  trades upwards now, it is likely only going to be short lived. As per my previous analysis, price is still in a long term  bearish flag  pattern and this measure move target has still not been achieved yet.  

Now, this level has to be reached in my opinion. I believe regardless of if price holds at 6040 and 5930, it will have to eventually come down and satisfy the  flag pattern . For this reason, we should watch Bitcoin's behavior in the short term to attempt to profit from small moves during this market correction. 

Bear in mind that price does NOT HAVE TO STAY BEYOND THE SUPPORT BETWEEN 6040 AN 5930. This is just a level that price MIGHT stop to get some upside before the ultimate downside takes over.

Wanted to play a bit with the range bars, guess you all saw it as what is new on  TD 0.28% . 

Red line was when we had our correction pattern... Now we are in a simple and quite obvious  Elliott wave  pattern. The next tick will happen in the zone of the red arrow (54-55-56 zone). Expect a strong bounce to the 5900--6200 after and then we should normally go have our final dive to the dept of panic. And bots that will just start panic selling. The bad thing about bots, is that they have very very simple coding...Even those they call Ai bots, are first not AI bots, but use narrow artificial intelligence, and are really good at performing that one single task they where programmed for.

Everybody is looking for the sweet spot where  Bitcoin 0.61%  will reverse for good and start climbing to higher levels. Ideally in order to have a clear view for that, we better focus at the higher timeframes to get the bigger picture. For now, we are clearly in a bear market and trading it short term is absolutely ok.  

Looking at the hourly chart of  Bitcoin 0.61%  we may see that price is forming a  H&S  pattern after bouncing from a key  structure resistance  level.

Everybody is looking for the sweet spot where  Bitcoin 0.59%  will reverse for good and start climbing to higher levels. Ideally in order to have a clear view for that, we better focus at the higher timeframes to get the bigger picture. For now, we are clearly in a bear market and trading it short term is absolutely ok.  

Looking at the hourly chart of  Bitcoin 0.59%  we may see that price is forming a  H&S  pattern after bouncing from a key  structure resistance  level. Selling at the level of the left shoulder at around $6250 with a stoploss above $6350 is a nice idea. As for tp $5780 (previous lows) looks like a realistic level.

HI Friends, 

We can clearly see a  falling wedge  with higher highs.  

In a weekly chart, buying pressure is increasing as we can see that candle's size is getting smaller. I am anticipated a nice rally soon. 

Lets wait for the candle to close out of the  falling wedge  to get the confirmation of a  bullish trend . We then can  start trading. 

Thank you

Posting a quick  daily analysis , as I am currently in the process of moving house so I have been very busy. 

Bitcoin 0.59%  is currently trading at a horizontal  support zone  between 6040 and 5930. Price could either bounce up from here to the highs, or break the horizontal  support zone  and break lower. 

Now, for this next part I recommend you read my previous  Bitcoin 0.59%  analysis as this part is more difficult... (See related ideas below this analysis)... If  Bitcoin 0.59%  trades upwards now, it is likely only going to be short lived. As per my previous analysis, price is still in a long term  bearish flag  pattern and this measure move target has still not been achieved yet.  

Now, this level has to be reached in my opinion. I believe regardless of if price holds at 6040 and 5930, it will have to eventually come down and satisfy the  flag pattern . For this reason, we should watch Bitcoin's behavior in the short term to attempt to profit from small moves during this market correction. 

Bear in mind that price does NOT HAVE TO STAY BEYOND THE SUPPORT BETWEEN 6040 AN 5930. This is just a level that price MIGHT stop to get some upside before the ultimate downside takes over.

Look at the red lines and the black lines 

Wanted to play a bit with the range bars, guess you all saw it as what is new on  TD 0.28% . 

Red line was when we had our correction pattern... Now we are in a simple and quite obvious  Elliott wave  pattern. The next tick will happen in the zone of the red arrow (54-55-56 zone). Expect a strong bounce to the 5900--6200 after and then we should normally go have our final dive to the dept of panic. And bots that will just start panic selling. The bad thing about bots, is that they have very very simple coding...Even those they call Ai bots, are first not AI bots, but use narrow artificial intelligence, and are really good at performing that one single task they where programmed for.  
This is going to be fun!!

Look at the red lines and the black lines 

Wanted to play a bit with the range bars, guess you all saw it as what is new on  TD 0.28% . 

Red line was when we had our correction pattern... Now we are in a simple and quite obvious  Elliott wave  pattern. The next tick will happen in the zone of the red arrow (54-55-56 zone). Expect a strong bounce to the 5900--6200 after and then we should normally go have our final dive to the dept of panic. And bots that will just start panic selling. The bad thing about bots, is that they have very very simple coding...Even those they call Ai bots, are first not AI bots, but use narrow artificial intelligence, and are really good at performing that one single task they where programmed for.

Everybody is looking for the sweet spot where  Bitcoin              will reverse for good and start climbing to higher levels. Ideally in order to have a clear view for that, we better focus at the higher timeframes to get the bigger picture. For now, we are clearly in a bear market and trading it short term is absolutely ok.  

Looking at the hourly chart of  Bitcoin              we may see that price is forming a  H&S  pattern after bouncing from a key  structure resistance  level. Selling at the level of the left shoulder at around $6250 with a stoploss above $6350 is a nice idea. As for tp $5780 (previous lows) looks like a realistic level.

HI Friends, 

We can clearly see a  falling wedge  with higher highs.  

In a weekly chart, buying pressure is increasing as we can see that candle's size is getting smaller. I am anticipated a nice rally soon. 

Lets wait for the candle to close out of the  falling wedge  to get the confirmation of a  bullish trend . We then can  start trading. 

Thank you

Posting a quick  daily analysis , as I am currently in the process of moving house so I have been very busy. 

Bitcoin 0.44%  is currently trading at a horizontal  support zone  between 6040 and 5930. Price could either bounce up from here to the highs, or break the horizontal  support zone  and break lower. 

Now, for this next part I recommend you read my previous  Bitcoin 0.44%  analysis as this part is more difficult... (See related ideas below this analysis)... If  Bitcoin 0.44%  trades upwards now, it is likely only going to be short lived. As per my previous analysis, price is still in a long term  bearish flag  pattern and this measure move target has still not been achieved yet.  

Now, this level has to be reached in my opinion. I believe regardless of if price holds at 6040 and 5930, it will have to eventually come down and satisfy the  flag pattern . For this reason, we should watch Bitcoin's behavior in the short term to attempt to profit from small moves during this market correction. 

Bear in mind that price does NOT HAVE TO STAY BEYOND THE SUPPORT BETWEEN 6040 AN 5930. This is just a level that price MIGHT stop to get some upside before the ultimate downside takes over.

Posting a quick  daily analysis , as I am currently in the process of moving house so I have been very busy. 

Bitcoin 0.52%  is currently trading at a horizontal  support zone  between 6040 and 5930. Price could either bounce up from here to the highs, or break the horizontal  support zone  and break lower. 

Now, for this next part I recommend you read my previous  Bitcoin 0.52%  analysis as this part is more difficult... (See related ideas below this analysis)... If  Bitcoin 0.52%  trades upwards now, it is likely only going to be short lived. As per my previous analysis, price is still in a long term  bearish flag  pattern and this measure move target has still not been achieved yet.  

Now, this level has to be reached in my opinion. I believe regardless of if price holds at 6040 and 5930, it will have to eventually come down and satisfy the  flag pattern . For this reason, we should watch Bitcoin's behavior in the short term to attempt to profit from small moves during this market correction. 

Bear in mind that price does NOT HAVE TO STAY BEYOND THE SUPPORT BETWEEN 6040 AN 5930. This is just a level that price MIGHT stop to get some upside before the ultimate downside takes over.

Look at the red lines and the black lines 

Wanted to play a bit with the range bars, guess you all saw it as what is new on  TD             . 

Red line was when we had our correction pattern... Now we are in a simple and quite obvious  Elliott wave  pattern. The next tick will happen in the zone of the red arrow (54-55-56 zone). Expect a strong bounce to the 5900--6200 after and then we should normally go have our final dive to the dept of panic. And bots that will just start panic selling. The bad thing about bots, is that they have very very simple coding...Even those they call Ai bots, are first not AI bots, but use narrow artificial intelligence, and are really good at performing that one single task they where programmed for.

Everybody is looking for the sweet spot where  Bitcoin 0.52%  will reverse for good and start climbing to higher levels. Ideally in order to have a clear view for that, we better focus at the higher timeframes to get the bigger picture. For now, we are clearly in a bear market and trading it short term is absolutely ok.  

Looking at the hourly chart of  Bitcoin 0.52%  we may see that price is forming a  H&S  pattern after bouncing from a key  structure resistance  level. Selling at the level of the left shoulder at around $6250 with a stoploss above $6350 is a nice idea. As for tp $5780 (previous lows) looks like a realistic level.

HI Friends, 

We can clearly see a  falling wedge  with higher highs.  

In a weekly chart, buying pressure is increasing as we can see that candle's size is getting smaller. I am anticipated a nice rally soon. 

Lets wait for the candle to close out of the  falling wedge  to get the confirmation of a  bullish trend . We then can  start trading. 

Thank you

Posting a quick  daily analysis , as I am currently in the process of moving house so I have been very busy. 

Bitcoin              is currently trading at a horizontal  support zone  between 6040 and 5930. Price could either bounce up from here to the highs, or break the horizontal  support zone  and break lower. 

Now, for this next part I recommend you read my previous  Bitcoin              analysis as this part is more difficult... (See related ideas below this analysis)... If  Bitcoin              trades upwards now, it is likely only going to be short lived. As per my previous analysis, price is still in a long term  bearish flag  pattern and this measure move target has still not been achieved yet.  

Now, this level has to be reached in my opinion. I believe regardless of if price holds at 6040 and 5930, it will have to eventually come down and satisfy the  flag pattern . For this reason, we should watch Bitcoin's behavior in the short term to attempt to profit from small moves during this market correction. 

Bear in mind that price does NOT HAVE TO STAY BEYOND THE SUPPORT BETWEEN 6040 AN 5930. This is just a level that price MIGHT stop to get some upside before the ultimate downside takes over.

Look at the red lines and the black lines 

Wanted to play a bit with the range bars, guess you all saw it as what is new on  TD 0.28% . 

Red line was when we had our correction pattern... Now we are in a simple and quite obvious  Elliott wave  pattern. The next tick will happen in the zone of the red arrow (54-55-56 zone). Expect a strong bounce to the 5900--6200 after and then we should normally go have our final dive to the dept of panic. And bots that will just start panic selling. The bad thing about bots, is that they have very very simple coding...Even those they call Ai bots, are first not AI bots, but use narrow artificial intelligence, and are really good at performing that one single task they where programmed for.

Everybody is looking for the sweet spot where  Bitcoin              will reverse for good and start climbing to higher levels. Ideally in order to have a clear view for that, we better focus at the higher timeframes to get the bigger picture. For now, we are clearly in a bear market and trading it short term is absolutely ok.  

Looking at the hourly chart of  Bitcoin              we may see that price is forming a  H&S  pattern after bouncing from a key  structure resistance  level. Selling at the level of the left shoulder at around $6250 with a stoploss above $6350 is a nice idea. As for tp $5780 (previous lows) looks like a realistic level.

HI Friends, 

We can clearly see a  falling wedge  with higher highs.  

In a weekly chart, buying pressure is increasing as we can see that candle's size is getting smaller. I am anticipated a nice rally soon. 

Lets wait for the candle to close out of the  falling wedge  to get the confirmation of a  bullish trend . We then can  start trading. 

Thank you

HI Friends, 

We can clearly see a  falling wedge  with higher highs.  

In a weekly chart, buying pressure is increasing as we can see that candle's size is getting smaller. I am anticipated a nice rally soon. 

Lets wait for the candle to close out of the  falling wedge  to get the confirmation of a  bullish trend . We then can  start trading. 

Thank you

 Bullish divergence  on the daily  BTC 0.53%  and the  MACD  is trying to become  bullish . Overall  volume  very low and a  bearish pennant  on the hourly.  

Strong support within the 5500-5600 area mid-term. Support line @5500 + bottom of the  falling wedge .

Posting a quick  daily analysis , as I am currently in the process of moving house so I have been very busy. 

Bitcoin              is currently trading at a horizontal  support zone  between 6040 and 5930. Price could either bounce up from here to the highs, or break the horizontal  support zone  and break lower. 

Now, for this next part I recommend you read my previous  Bitcoin              analysis as this part is more difficult... (See related ideas below this analysis)... If  Bitcoin              trades upwards now, it is likely only going to be short lived. As per my previous analysis, price is still in a long term  bearish flag  pattern and this measure move target has still not been achieved yet.  

Now, this level has to be reached in my opinion. I believe regardless of if price holds at 6040 and 5930, it will have to eventually come down and satisfy the  flag pattern . For this reason, we should watch Bitcoin's behavior in the short term to attempt to profit from small moves during this market correction. 

Bear in mind that price does NOT HAVE TO STAY BEYOND THE SUPPORT BETWEEN 6040 AN 5930. This is just a level that price MIGHT stop to get some upside before the ultimate downside takes over.

Look at the red lines and the black lines 

Wanted to play a bit with the range bars, guess you all saw it as what is new on  TD             . 

Red line was when we had our correction pattern... Now we are in a simple and quite obvious  Elliott wave  pattern. The next tick will happen in the zone of the red arrow (54-55-56 zone). Expect a strong bounce to the 5900--6200 after and then we should normally go have our final dive to the dept of panic. And bots that will just start panic selling. The bad thing about bots, is that they have very very simple coding...Even those they call Ai bots, are first not AI bots, but use narrow artificial intelligence, and are really good at performing that one single task they where programmed for.

Everybody is looking for the sweet spot where  Bitcoin 0.60%  will reverse for good and start climbing to higher levels. Ideally in order to have a clear view for that, we better focus at the higher timeframes to get the bigger picture. For now, we are clearly in a bear market and trading it short term is absolutely ok.  

Looking at the hourly chart of  Bitcoin 0.60%  we may see that price is forming a  H&S  pattern after bouncing from a key  structure resistance  level. Selling at the level of the left shoulder at around $6250 with a stoploss above $6350 is a nice idea. As for tp $5780 (previous lows) looks like a realistic level.

HI Friends, 

We can clearly see a  falling wedge  with higher highs.  

In a weekly chart, buying pressure is increasing as we can see that candle's size is getting smaller. I am anticipated a nice rally soon. 

Lets wait for the candle to close out of the  falling wedge  to get the confirmation of a  bullish trend . We then can  start trading. 

Thank you

Posting a quick  daily analysis , as I am currently in the process of moving house so I have been very busy. 

Bitcoin 0.60%  is currently trading at a horizontal  support zone  between 6040 and 5930. Price could either bounce up from here to the highs, or break the horizontal  support zone  and break lower. 

Now, for this next part I recommend you read my previous  Bitcoin 0.60%  analysis as this part is more difficult... (See related ideas below this analysis)... If  Bitcoin 0.60%  trades upwards now, it is likely only going to be short lived. As per my previous analysis, price is still in a long term  bearish flag  pattern and this measure move target has still not been achieved yet.  

Now, this level has to be reached in my opinion. I believe regardless of if price holds at 6040 and 5930, it will have to eventually come down and satisfy the  flag pattern . For this reason, we should watch Bitcoin's behavior in the short term to attempt to profit from small moves during this market correction. 

Bear in mind that price does NOT HAVE TO STAY BEYOND THE SUPPORT BETWEEN 6040 AN 5930. This is just a level that price MIGHT stop to get some upside before the ultimate downside takes over.

Look at the red lines and the black lines 

Wanted to play a bit with the range bars, guess you all saw it as what is new on  TD 0.28% . 

Red line was when we had our correction pattern... Now we are in a simple and quite obvious  Elliott wave  pattern. The next tick will happen in the zone of the red arrow (54-55-56 zone). Expect a strong bounce to the 5900--6200 after and then we should normally go have our final dive to the dept of panic. And bots that will just start panic selling. The bad thing about bots, is that they have very very simple coding...Even those they call Ai bots, are first not AI bots, but use narrow artificial intelligence, and are really good at performing that one single task they where programmed for.

Look at the red lines and the black lines 

Wanted to play a bit with the range bars, guess you all saw it as what is new on  TD             . 

Red line was when we had our correction pattern... Now we are in a simple and quite obvious  Elliott wave  pattern. The next tick will happen in the zone of the red arrow (54-55-56 zone). Expect a strong bounce to the 5900--6200 after and then we should normally go have our final dive to the dept of panic. And bots that will just start panic selling. The bad thing about bots, is that they have very very simple coding...Even those they call Ai bots, are first not AI bots, but use narrow artificial intelligence, and are really good at performing that one single task they where programmed for.

Ideally in order to have a clear view for that, we better focus at the higher timeframes to get the bigger picture. For now, we are clearly in a bear market and trading it short term is absolutely ok.  

Looking at the hourly chart of  Bitcoin 0.62%  we may see that price is forming a  H&S  pattern after bouncing from a key  structure resistance  level. Selling at the level of the left shoulder at around $6250 with a stoploss above $6350 is a nice idea. As for tp $5780 (previous lows) looks like a realistic level.

HI Friends, 

We can clearly see a  falling wedge  with higher highs.  

In a weekly chart, buying pressure is increasing as we can see that candle's size is getting smaller. I am anticipated a nice rally soon. 

Lets wait for the candle to close out of the  falling wedge  to get the confirmation of a  bullish trend . We then can  start trading. 

Thank you

Posting a quick  daily analysis , as I am currently in the process of moving house so I have been very busy. 

Bitcoin              is currently trading at a horizontal  support zone  between 6040 and 5930. Price could either bounce up from here to the highs, or break the horizontal  support zone  and break lower. 

Now, for this next part I recommend you read my previous  Bitcoin              analysis as this part is more difficult... (See related ideas below this analysis)... If  Bitcoin              trades upwards now, it is likely only going to be short lived. As per my previous analysis, price is still in a long term  bearish flag  pattern and this measure move target has still not been achieved yet.  

Now, this level has to be reached in my opinion. I believe regardless of if price holds at 6040 and 5930, it will have to eventually come down and satisfy the  flag pattern . For this reason, we should watch Bitcoin's behavior in the short term to attempt to profit from small moves during this market correction. 

Bear in mind that price does NOT HAVE TO STAY BEYOND THE SUPPORT BETWEEN 6040 AN 5930. This is just a level that price MIGHT stop to get some upside before the ultimate downside takes over.

Posting a quick  daily analysis , as I am currently in the process of moving house so I have been very busy. 

Bitcoin 0.60%  is currently trading at a horizontal  support zone  between 6040 and 5930. Price could either bounce up from here to the highs, or break the horizontal  support zone  and break lower. 

Now, for this next part I recommend you read my previous  Bitcoin 0.60%  analysis as this part is more difficult... (See related ideas below this analysis)... If  Bitcoin 0.60%  trades upwards now, it is likely only going to be short lived. As per my previous analysis, price is still in a long term  bearish flag  pattern and this measure move target has still not been achieved yet.  

Now, this level has to be reached in my opinion. I believe regardless of if price holds at 6040 and 5930, it will have to eventually come down and satisfy the  flag pattern . For this reason, we should watch Bitcoin's behavior in the short term to attempt to profit from small moves during this market correction. 

Bear in mind that price does NOT HAVE TO STAY BEYOND THE SUPPORT BETWEEN 6040 AN 5930. This is just a level that price MIGHT stop to get some upside before the ultimate downside takes over.

Look at the red lines and the black lines 

Wanted to play a bit with the range bars, guess you all saw it as what is new on  TD 0.28% . 

Red line was when we had our correction pattern... Now we are in a simple and quite obvious  Elliott wave  pattern. The next tick will happen in the zone of the red arrow (54-55-56 zone). Expect a strong bounce to the 5900--6200 after and then we should normally go have our final dive to the dept of panic. And bots that will just start panic selling. The bad thing about bots, is that they have very very simple coding...Even those they call Ai bots, are first not AI bots, but use narrow artificial intelligence, and are really good at performing that one single task they where programmed for.

Everybody is looking for the sweet spot where  Bitcoin              will reverse for good and start climbing to higher levels. Ideally in order to have a clear view for that, we better focus at the higher timeframes to get the bigger picture. For now, we are clearly in a bear market and trading it short term is absolutely ok.  

Looking at the hourly chart of  Bitcoin              we may see that price is forming a  H&S  pattern after bouncing from a key  structure resistance  level. Selling at the level of the left shoulder at around $6250 with a stoploss above $6350 is a nice idea. As for tp $5780 (previous lows) looks like a realistic level.

HI Friends, 

We can clearly see a  falling wedge  with higher highs.  

In a weekly chart, buying pressure is increasing as we can see that candle's size is getting smaller. I am anticipated a nice rally soon. 

Lets wait for the candle to close out of the  falling wedge  to get the confirmation of a  bullish trend . We then can  start trading. 

Thank you

Posting a quick  daily analysis , as I am currently in the process of moving house so I have been very busy. 

Bitcoin 0.60%  is currently trading at a horizontal  support zone  between 6040 and 5930. Price could either bounce up from here to the highs, or break the horizontal  support zone  and break lower. 

Now, for this next part I recommend you read my previous  Bitcoin 0.60%  analysis as this part is more difficult... (See related ideas below this analysis)... If  Bitcoin 0.60%  trades upwards now, it is likely only going to be short lived. As per my previous analysis, price is still in a long term  bearish flag  pattern and this measure move target has still not been achieved yet.  

Now, this level has to be reached in my opinion. I believe regardless of if price holds at 6040 and 5930, it will have to eventually come down and satisfy the  flag pattern . For this reason, we should watch Bitcoin's behavior in the short term to attempt to profit from small moves during this market correction. 

Bear in mind that price does NOT HAVE TO STAY BEYOND THE SUPPORT BETWEEN 6040 AN 5930. This is just a level that price MIGHT stop to get some upside before the ultimate downside takes over.

Look at the red lines and the black lines 

Wanted to play a bit with the range bars, guess you all saw it as what is new on  TD             . 

Red line was when we had our correction pattern... Now we are in a simple and quite obvious  Elliott wave  pattern. The next tick will happen in the zone of the red arrow (54-55-56 zone). Expect a strong bounce to the 5900--6200 after and then we should normally go have our final dive to the dept of panic. And bots that will just start panic selling. The bad thing about bots, is that they have very very simple coding...Even those they call Ai bots, are first not AI bots, but use narrow artificial intelligence, and are really good at performing that one single task they where programmed for.

Everybody is looking for the sweet spot where  Bitcoin 0.60%  will reverse for good and start climbing to higher levels. Ideally in order to have a clear view for that, we better focus at the higher timeframes to get the bigger picture. For now, we are clearly in a bear market and trading it short term is absolutely ok.  

Looking at the hourly chart of  Bitcoin 0.60%  we may see that price is forming a  H&S  pattern after bouncing from a key  structure resistance  level. Selling at the level of the left shoulder at around $6250 with a stoploss above $6350 is a nice idea. As for tp $5780 (previous lows) looks like a realistic level.

HI Friends, 

We can clearly see a  falling wedge  with higher highs.  

In a weekly chart, buying pressure is increasing as we can see that candle's size is getting smaller. I am anticipated a nice rally soon. 

Lets wait for the candle to close out of the  falling wedge  to get the confirmation of a  bullish trend . We then can  start trading. 

Thank you

Ideally in order to have a clear view for that, we better focus at the higher timeframes to get the bigger picture. For now, we are clearly in a bear market and trading it short term is absolutely ok.  

Looking at the hourly chart of  Bitcoin 0.59%  we may see that price is forming a  H&S  pattern after bouncing from a key  structure resistance  level. Selling at the level of the left shoulder at around $6250 with a stoploss above $6350 is a nice idea. As for tp $5780 (previous lows) looks like a realistic level.

HI Friends, 

We can clearly see a  falling wedge  with higher highs.  

In a weekly chart, buying pressure is increasing as we can see that candle's size is getting smaller. I am anticipated a nice rally soon. 

Lets wait for the candle to close out of the  falling wedge  to get the confirmation of a  bullish trend . We then can  start trading. 

Thank you

 Bullish divergence  on the daily  BTC 0.59%  and the  MACD  is trying to become  bullish . Overall  volume  very low and a  bearish pennant  on the hourly.  

Strong support within the 5500-5600 area mid-term. Support line @5500 + bottom of the  falling wedge . 

Good luck trading!

Posting a quick  daily analysis , as I am currently in the process of moving house so I have been very busy. 

Bitcoin 0.59%  is currently trading at a horizontal  support zone  between 6040 and 5930. Price could either bounce up from here to the highs, or break the horizontal  support zone  and break lower. 

Now, for this next part I recommend you read my previous  Bitcoin 0.59%  analysis as this part is more difficult... (See related ideas below this analysis)... If  Bitcoin 0.59%  trades upwards now, it is likely only going to be short lived. As per my previous analysis, price is still in a long term  bearish flag  pattern and this measure move target has still not been achieved yet.  

Now, this level has to be reached in my opinion. I believe regardless of if price holds at 6040 and 5930, it will have to eventually come down and satisfy the  flag pattern . For this reason, we should watch Bitcoin's behavior in the short term to attempt to profit from small moves during this market correction. 

Bear in mind that price does NOT HAVE TO STAY BEYOND THE SUPPORT BETWEEN 6040 AN 5930. This is just a level that price MIGHT stop to get some upside before the ultimate downside takes over.

Look at the red lines and the black lines 

Wanted to play a bit with the range bars, guess you all saw it as what is new on  TD 0.28% . 

Red line was when we had our correction pattern... Now we are in a simple and quite obvious  Elliott wave  pattern. The next tick will happen in the zone of the red arrow (54-55-56 zone). Expect a strong bounce to the 5900--6200 after and then we should normally go have our final dive to the dept of panic. And bots that will just start panic selling. The bad thing about bots, is that they have very very simple coding...Even those they call Ai bots, are first not AI bots, but use narrow artificial intelligence, and are really good at performing that one single task they where programmed for.  
This is going to be fun!! 
Still keep an eye open lot's of tether have been printed out, they might start rigging this dog eating dog game again
