1530086612.0,drdiesel,Ethereum to  300 before bulltrap then bottom at 200,"
I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.19%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars. I see the ultimate low for  ethereum 1.19%  at 200 dollars. This is what my gut told me in January but I refused to listen to it. Obviously  ethereum 1.19% futures  news and a  btc -0.01% etf  can change that . Right now we should assume that we are in a prolonged bear market so the banks can buy more cheap. Obviously things can change on a dime. The vpvr shows most of the  volume  during this bull run at 180 to 300 dollars.

The  Ethereum 1.19%  rate dropped slightly, but the flat continues. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD 1.19% . 
Ethereum 1.19%  rate, along with  Bitcoin -0.01% , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum 1.19%  rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD 1.19%  rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD 1.19%  rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ethereum 1.19%  may stay in flat for another day.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.19%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.19%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Switched up my trading style to accommodate the current market conditions. Technically we are in a ""no trade zone"", so all trading should be executed with extreme caution and risk management. If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC -0.01% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Switched up my trading style to accommodate the current market conditions. Technically we are in a ""no trade zone"", so all trading should be executed with extreme caution and risk management. If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC -0.05% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.19%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars. I see the ultimate low for  ethereum 1.19%  at 200 dollars. This is what my gut told me in January but I refused to listen to it. Obviously  ethereum 1.19% futures  news and a  btc -0.06% etf  can change that . Right now we should assume that we are in a prolonged bear market so the banks can buy more cheap. Obviously things can change on a dime. The vpvr shows most of the  volume  during this bull run at 180 to 300 dollars.

The  Ethereum 1.19%  rate dropped slightly, but the flat continues. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD 1.19% . 
Ethereum 1.19%  rate, along with  Bitcoin -0.06% , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum 1.19%  rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD 1.19%  rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD 1.19%  rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ethereum 1.19%  may stay in flat for another day.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.19%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.19%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.19%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars. I see the ultimate low for  ethereum 1.19%  at 200 dollars. This is what my gut told me in January but I refused to listen to it. Obviously  ethereum 1.19% futures  news and a  btc             etf  can change that . Right now we should assume that we are in a prolonged bear market so the banks can buy more cheap. Obviously things can change on a dime. The vpvr shows most of the  volume  during this bull run at 180 to 300 dollars.

The  Ethereum 1.19%  rate dropped slightly, but the flat continues. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD 1.19% . 
Ethereum 1.19%  rate, along with  Bitcoin -0.06% , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum 1.19%  rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD 1.19%  rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD 1.19%  rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ethereum 1.19%  may stay in flat for another day.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum              is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum              to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC -0.06% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.17%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars. I see the ultimate low for  ethereum 1.17%  at 200 dollars. This is what my gut told me in January but I refused to listen to it. Obviously  ethereum 1.17% futures  news and a  btc -0.06% etf  can change that . Right now we should assume that we are in a prolonged bear market so the banks can buy more cheap.

The  Ethereum 1.17%  rate dropped slightly, but the flat continues. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD 1.17% . 
Ethereum 1.17%  rate, along with  Bitcoin -0.06% , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum 1.17%  rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD 1.17%  rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD 1.17%  rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ethereum 1.17%  may stay in flat for another day.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.17%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.17%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Switched up my trading style to accommodate the current market conditions. Technically we are in a ""no trade zone"", so all trading should be executed with extreme caution and risk management. If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC -0.05% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.16%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars. I see the ultimate low for  ethereum 1.16%  at 200 dollars. This is what my gut told me in January but I refused to listen to it. Obviously  ethereum 1.16% futures  news and a  btc -0.06% etf  can change that . Right now we should assume that we are in a prolonged bear market so the banks can buy more cheap.

The  Ethereum 1.16%  rate dropped slightly, but the flat continues. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD 1.16% . 
Ethereum 1.16%  rate, along with  Bitcoin -0.06% , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum 1.16%  rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD 1.16%  rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD 1.16%  rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ethereum 1.16%  may stay in flat for another day.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.16%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.16%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Switched up my trading style to accommodate the current market conditions. Technically we are in a ""no trade zone"", so all trading should be executed with extreme caution and risk management. If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC              direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC -0.06% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

If  Ethereum 1.18%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.18%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Switched up my trading style to accommodate the current market conditions. Technically we are in a ""no trade zone"", so all trading should be executed with extreme caution and risk management. If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC -0.05% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.18%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.25%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars. I see the ultimate low for  ethereum 1.25%  at 200 dollars. This is what my gut told me in January but I refused to listen to it. Obviously  ethereum 1.25% futures  news and a  btc 0.03% etf  can change that . Right now we should assume that we are in a prolonged bear market so the banks can buy more cheap. Obviously things can change on a dime. The vpvr shows most of the  volume  during this bull run at 180 to 300 dollars.

The  Ethereum 1.25%  rate dropped slightly, but the flat continues. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD 1.25% . 
Ethereum 1.25%  rate, along with  Bitcoin 0.02% , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum 1.25%  rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD 1.25%  rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD 1.25%  rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ethereum 1.25%  may stay in flat for another day.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.25%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.25%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC              direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.25%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars. I see the ultimate low for  ethereum 1.25%  at 200 dollars. This is what my gut told me in January but I refused to listen to it. Obviously  ethereum 1.25% futures  news and a  btc 0.04% etf  can change that . Right now we should assume that we are in a prolonged bear market so the banks can buy more cheap. Obviously things can change on a dime. The vpvr shows most of the  volume  during this bull run at 180 to 300 dollars.

The  Ethereum 1.25%  rate dropped slightly, but the flat continues. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD 1.25% . 
Ethereum 1.25%  rate, along with  Bitcoin 0.04% , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum 1.25%  rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD 1.25%  rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD 1.25%  rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ethereum 1.25%  may stay in flat for another day.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.25%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.25%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Switched up my trading style to accommodate the current market conditions. Technically we are in a ""no trade zone"", so all trading should be executed with extreme caution and risk management. If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC              direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.04% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.25%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars. I see the ultimate low for  ethereum 1.25%  at 200 dollars. This is what my gut told me in January but I refused to listen to it. Obviously  ethereum 1.25% futures  news and a  btc 0.04% etf  can change that . Right now we should assume that we are in a prolonged bear market so the banks can buy more cheap. Obviously things can change on a dime. The vpvr shows most of the  volume  during this bull run at 180 to 300 dollars.

The  Ethereum 1.25%  rate dropped slightly, but the flat continues. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD 1.25% . 
Ethereum 1.25%  rate, along with  Bitcoin 0.04% , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum 1.25%  rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD 1.25%  rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD 1.25%  rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ethereum 1.25%  may stay in flat for another day.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.25%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.25%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Switched up my trading style to accommodate the current market conditions. Technically we are in a ""no trade zone"", so all trading should be executed with extreme caution and risk management. If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.04% , in order to stay relatively strong.

ETH/USD UPDATE:  Daily Chart:  ETH/USD has continued to respect the longer term ascending  trend line  as well as respecting a newer, more aggressive upward trend since April.  This is condensing the consolidation which I feel is overall  bullish .   BTC 0.04%  movements will certainly affect ETH price in shorter term.  A severe  BTC 0.04%  drop would likey pull us downward at least to the supports or even the lower  trendline  (or even below), but ETH has remained very strong even in steep dips.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.25%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.25%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.04% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.25%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars.

Ethereum 1.25%  rate, along with  Bitcoin 0.04% , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum 1.25%  rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD 1.25%  rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.25%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars. I see the ultimate low for  ethereum 1.25%  at 200 dollars. This is what my gut told me in January but I refused to listen to it. Obviously  ethereum 1.25% futures  news and a  btc 0.03% etf  can change that . Right now we should assume that we are in a prolonged bear market so the banks can buy more cheap. Obviously things can change on a dime. The vpvr shows most of the  volume  during this bull run at 180 to 300 dollars.

The  Ethereum 1.25%  rate dropped slightly, but the flat continues. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD 1.25% . 
Ethereum 1.25%  rate, along with  Bitcoin 0.03% , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum 1.25%  rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD 1.25%  rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD 1.25%  rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ethereum 1.25%  may stay in flat for another day.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.25%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.25%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.25%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars. I see the ultimate low for  ethereum 1.25%  at 200 dollars. This is what my gut told me in January but I refused to listen to it. Obviously  ethereum 1.25% futures  news and a  btc 0.03% etf  can change that . Right now we should assume that we are in a prolonged bear market so the banks can buy more cheap. Obviously things can change on a dime. The vpvr shows most of the  volume  during this bull run at 180 to 300 dollars.

The  Ethereum 1.25%  rate dropped slightly, but the flat continues. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD 1.25% . 
Ethereum 1.25%  rate, along with  Bitcoin 0.03% , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum 1.25%  rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD 1.25%  rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD 1.25%  rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ethereum 1.25%  may stay in flat for another day.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum              is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum              to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Switched up my trading style to accommodate the current market conditions. Technically we are in a ""no trade zone"", so all trading should be executed with extreme caution and risk management. If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.03% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.25%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars. I see the ultimate low for  ethereum 1.25%  at 200 dollars. This is what my gut told me in January but I refused to listen to it. Obviously  ethereum 1.25% futures  news and a  btc 0.03% etf  can change that . Right now we should assume that we are in a prolonged bear market so the banks can buy more cheap. Obviously things can change on a dime. The vpvr shows most of the  volume  during this bull run at 180 to 300 dollars.

The  Ethereum 1.25%  rate dropped slightly, but the flat continues. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD 1.25% . 
Ethereum 1.25%  rate, along with  Bitcoin 0.03% , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum 1.25%  rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD 1.25%  rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD 1.25%  rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ethereum 1.25%  may stay in flat for another day.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.26%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.26%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Switched up my trading style to accommodate the current market conditions. Technically we are in a ""no trade zone"", so all trading should be executed with extreme caution and risk management. If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC -0.02% , in order to stay relatively strong.

Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD 1.26% . 
Ethereum 1.26%  rate, along with  Bitcoin 0.02% , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum 1.26%  rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD 1.26%  rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD 1.26%  rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ethereum 1.26%  may stay in flat for another day.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.26%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.26%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.02% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC              direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.09% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.26%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars. I see the ultimate low for  ethereum 1.26%  at 200 dollars. This is what my gut told me in January but I refused to listen to it. Obviously  ethereum 1.26% futures  news and a  btc 0.09% etf  can change that . Right now we should assume that we are in a prolonged bear market so the banks can buy more cheap. Obviously things can change on a dime. The vpvr shows most of the  volume  during this bull run at 180 to 300 dollars.

The  Ethereum              rate dropped slightly, but the flat continues. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD             . 
Ethereum              rate, along with  Bitcoin             , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum              rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD              rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD              rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ethereum              may stay in flat for another day.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.26%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.26%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum              bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars. I see the ultimate low for  ethereum              at 200 dollars. This is what my gut told me in January but I refused to listen to it. Obviously  ethereum             futures  news and a  btc             etf  can change that . Right now we should assume that we are in a prolonged bear market so the banks can buy more cheap. Obviously things can change on a dime.

The  Ethereum              rate dropped slightly, but the flat continues. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD             . 
Ethereum              rate, along with  Bitcoin             , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum              rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD              rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD              rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario:

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.26%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.26%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Switched up my trading style to accommodate the current market conditions. Technically we are in a ""no trade zone"", so all trading should be executed with extreme caution and risk management. If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC              direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.13% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.26%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars. I see the ultimate low for  ethereum 1.26%  at 200 dollars. This is what my gut told me in January but I refused to listen to it. Obviously  ethereum 1.26% futures  news and a  btc 0.13% etf  can change that . Right now we should assume that we are in a prolonged bear market so the banks can buy more cheap.

The  Ethereum 1.26%  rate dropped slightly, but the flat continues. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD 1.26% . 
Ethereum 1.26%  rate, along with  Bitcoin 0.12% , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum 1.26%  rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD 1.26%  rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD 1.26%  rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ethereum 1.26%  may stay in flat for another day.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.26%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.26%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Switched up my trading style to accommodate the current market conditions. Technically we are in a ""no trade zone"", so all trading should be executed with extreme caution and risk management. If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.13% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.26%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars. I see the ultimate low for  ethereum 1.26%  at 200 dollars. This is what my gut told me in January but I refused to listen to it.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum              is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum              to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it.

If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.13% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.10% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.29%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars. I see the ultimate low for  ethereum 1.29%  at 200 dollars. This is what my gut told me in January but I refused to listen to it. Obviously  ethereum 1.29% futures  news and a  btc 0.10% etf  can change that . Right now we should assume that we are in a prolonged bear market so the banks can buy more cheap. Obviously things can change on a dime. The vpvr shows most of the  volume  during this bull run at 180 to 300 dollars.

The  Ethereum 1.29%  rate dropped slightly, but the flat continues. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD 1.29% . 
Ethereum 1.29%  rate, along with  Bitcoin             , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum 1.29%  rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD 1.29%  rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD 1.29%  rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ethereum 1.29%  may stay in flat for another day.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.29%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.29%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.21%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars. I see the ultimate low for  ethereum 1.21%  at 200 dollars. This is what my gut told me in January but I refused to listen to it. Obviously  ethereum 1.21% futures  news and a  btc             etf  can change that . Right now we should assume that we are in a prolonged bear market so the banks can buy more cheap.

The  Ethereum              rate dropped slightly, but the flat continues. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD             . 
Ethereum              rate, along with  Bitcoin             , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum              rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD              rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD              rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ethereum              may stay in flat for another day.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.21%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.21%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.06%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars. I see the ultimate low for  ethereum 1.06%  at 200 dollars. This is what my gut told me in January but I refused to listen to it. Obviously  ethereum 1.06% futures  news and a  btc 0.08% etf  can change that . Right now we should assume that we are in a prolonged bear market so the banks can buy more cheap.

The  Ethereum 1.06%  rate dropped slightly, but the flat continues. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD 1.06% . 
Ethereum 1.06%  rate, along with  Bitcoin 0.08% , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum 1.06%  rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD 1.06%  rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD 1.06%  rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ethereum 1.06%  may stay in flat for another day.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.06%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.06%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Switched up my trading style to accommodate the current market conditions. Technically we are in a ""no trade zone"", so all trading should be executed with extreme caution and risk management. If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.08% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.06%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars. I see the ultimate low for  ethereum 1.06%  at 200 dollars. This is what my gut told me in January but I refused to listen to it. Obviously  ethereum 1.06% futures  news and a  btc 0.08% etf  can change that . Right now we should assume that we are in a prolonged bear market so the banks can buy more cheap. Obviously things can change on a dime. The vpvr shows most of the  volume  during this bull run at 180 to 300 dollars.

The  Ethereum 1.06%  rate dropped slightly, but the flat continues. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD 1.06% . 
Ethereum 1.06%  rate, along with  Bitcoin 0.08% , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum 1.06%  rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD 1.06%  rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD 1.06%  rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ethereum 1.06%  may stay in flat for another day.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.06%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.06%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Switched up my trading style to accommodate the current market conditions. Technically we are in a ""no trade zone"", so all trading should be executed with extreme caution and risk management. If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.08% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

If  Ethereum 1.09%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.09%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.28% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.17%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars. I see the ultimate low for  ethereum 1.17%  at 200 dollars. This is what my gut told me in January but I refused to listen to it.

The  Ethereum 1.17%  rate dropped slightly, but the flat continues. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD 1.17% . 
Ethereum 1.17%  rate, along with  Bitcoin             , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum 1.17%  rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD 1.17%  rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD 1.17%  rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario:

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.08%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars. I see the ultimate low for  ethereum 1.08%  at 200 dollars. This is what my gut told me in January but I refused to listen to it. Obviously  ethereum 1.08% futures  news and a  btc 0.05% etf  can change that . Right now we should assume that we are in a prolonged bear market so the banks can buy more cheap. Obviously things can change on a dime. The vpvr shows most of the  volume  during this bull run at 180 to 300 dollars.

The  Ethereum 1.08%  rate dropped slightly, but the flat continues. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD 1.08% . 
Ethereum 1.08%  rate, along with  Bitcoin 0.05% , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum 1.08%  rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD 1.08%  rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD 1.08%  rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ethereum 1.08%  may stay in flat for another day.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.08%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.08%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.05% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

I always had it in the back of my mind of  ethereum 1.06%  bottoming at 200 dollars in a bear market scenario.  We should break the April lows and bulltrap from 300 dollars to 550 to 650 dollars. I see the ultimate low for  ethereum 1.06%  at 200 dollars. This is what my gut told me in January but I refused to listen to it. Obviously  ethereum 1.06% futures  news and a  btc 0.03% etf  can change that . Right now we should assume that we are in a prolonged bear market so the banks can buy more cheap. Obviously things can change on a dime. The vpvr shows most of the  volume  during this bull run at 180 to 300 dollars.

The  Ethereum 1.06%  rate dropped slightly, but the flat continues. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD 1.06% . 
Ethereum 1.06%  rate, along with  Bitcoin 0.03% , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum 1.06%  rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD 1.06%  rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD 1.06%  rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ethereum 1.06%  may stay in flat for another day.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.06%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.06%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Switched up my trading style to accommodate the current market conditions. Technically we are in a ""no trade zone"", so all trading should be executed with extreme caution and risk management. If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.03% , in order to stay relatively strong.
