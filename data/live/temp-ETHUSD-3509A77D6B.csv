The  Ethereum 0.48%  rate dropped slightly, but the flat continues. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD 0.48% . 
Ethereum 0.48%  rate, along with  Bitcoin 0.11% , is in uncertainty: there is nowhere to fall and there are no buyers yet. Therefore, we are watching the crypto market, waiting for someone's initiative. 
We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum 0.48%  rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD 0.48%  rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD 0.48%  rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ethereum 0.48%  may stay in flat for another day.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 0.48%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 0.48%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC              direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.18% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 0.60%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 0.60%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.03% , in order to stay relatively strong.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 0.60%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 0.60%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.03% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC              direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.04% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 0.62%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 0.62%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 0.57%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 0.57%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.04% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 0.57%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 0.57%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.03% , in order to stay relatively strong.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 0.57%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 0.57%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.03% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Switched up my trading style to accommodate the current market conditions. Technically we are in a ""no trade zone"", so all trading should be executed with extreme caution and risk management. If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.08% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 0.62%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 0.62%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 0.83%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 0.83%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC              direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 0.95%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 0.95%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.14% , in order to stay relatively strong.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.03%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.03%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Switched up my trading style to accommodate the current market conditions. Technically we are in a ""no trade zone"", so all trading should be executed with extreme caution and risk management. If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC              direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.21% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Switched up my trading style to accommodate the current market conditions. Technically we are in a ""no trade zone"", so all trading should be executed with extreme caution and risk management. If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC              direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.49% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

If  Ethereum 1.90%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.90%  to go as low as 310-300 range.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.56%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.56%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC              direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum              is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum              to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC              direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.27% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.55%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.55%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Switched up my trading style to accommodate the current market conditions. Technically we are in a ""no trade zone"", so all trading should be executed with extreme caution and risk management. If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.09% , in order to stay relatively strong.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.37%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.37%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Switched up my trading style to accommodate the current market conditions. Technically we are in a ""no trade zone"", so all trading should be executed with extreme caution and risk management. If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC              direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC 0.03% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.30%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.30%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum              is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum              to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC              direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC -0.06% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.19%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.19%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC -0.01% , in order to stay relatively strong.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.19%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.19%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC -0.01% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC -0.05% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.19%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.19%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

We stick with the forecast of growth of  Ethereum 1.19%  rate to $ 490. Of course, in such uncertainty other scenarios are possible. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD 1.19%  rate will rise from $ 430 to $ 490. 
2. The  ETHUSD 1.19%  rate will drop from $ 430 to $ 390. 
An alternative scenario: 
Ethereum 1.19%  may stay in flat for another day.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.19%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.19%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC              direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC             , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.17%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.17%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

Switched up my trading style to accommodate the current market conditions. Technically we are in a ""no trade zone"", so all trading should be executed with extreme caution and risk management. If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC -0.06% , in order to stay relatively strong.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.16%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.16%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.

If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC              direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC -0.06% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

If yo aren't confident, i would just stay out of the market. I've been short ETH lately and have been using rays off previous lows as well as channels to execute 1-3% margin trades. The ray is a powerful tool in determining areas will price will get held up in the short term. Trading within channels instead of hoping for breakouts is much easier at the moment as well.

Hey guys, ETH bulls didn't managed to hold the 4H lows yesterday. We have now touched on the 61.8% fibo level, where ETH is currently trying to form its new higher higher low.  

Both on the 4H & 1H we're currently under the EMAs. So -the ETH bulls have still some work to do here. 

More important: In the  ETH/BTC -5.26%  direct correlation we're now at the daily low at 0,071 -if we negate this, it means that we need to form another low until 0,055 -otherwise the weekly equilibrium will be broken with certainty. In any case, that ETH bulls need to hold the 0,071 direct correlation with  BTC -0.05% , in order to stay relatively strong.

I am sharing this possible  inverse h&s  because the  volume  is looking good for  h&s .  This pattern also sits on a big  falling wedge . 

The target is time dependent of breakout. Even if upper edge of the  falling wedge  is lower than the actual possible target, you can expect retrace from there, if it can manage to get up there. 

Of course this analysis highly dependent of the current market situation.  

I wouldn't get in any position before it breaks the neckline.

Believe it or not but it seems like Litecoin is leading the way for the correction in the cryptosphere. If  Ethereum 1.18%  is to follow suit lower lows will be expected breaking the long time support which now stands at 420 range. I expect  Ethereum 1.18%  to go as low as 310-300 range. At least that is what this correction is morphing into.  I am sure someone here will pick apart every line I have drawn and if it doesn't follow suit will find an issue with it. The dates in the chart are speculative and coincidental I would say more than anything. Corrections in crypto take a long time so patience is key.
