Hi all, this is a predictive model for  LTCUSD 2.34%  I've been working on and testing for a year now. 
This is the prealpha version of the strategy and I'm still migrating to Pine Version 3 and making the setting  interface 1.08%  cleaner.  
The full strategy will be built for 15m, 30m, 45m, 1h, and 2h for intraday suited signals and have alerts. Future versions will be AutoView compatible. 

If you're interested please let me know in the comments below and I'll make sure to get this development done as soon as possible.

Comment:
					The release version will have options such as trade frequency. This would allow users to intraday trade, day trade, and swing trade depending on preference.
