If we compare this price action to 2014, then we should be looking at a retracement to 50% fibo for wave X and then a final wave down to form Z. Wave Z is at 78.6% fibo just like in 2014 and also the bottom of the channel since 2012

A more thorough analysis of the Short term situation is presented on this chart. 

If  BTC -1.59%  manages to break through the resistance of $6500 and consolidate itself higher, then the price will have the opportunity to test the level of $7000. However the more probable opportunity is a slow and small rise after which there will be a decline to the lower edge of  Ichimoku cloud . In case of not overcoming resistance to the support range $6100-6000. The next step will be a reduction to the long term critical support around $5600-5900 up from which there will be a gradual rise which was described in the previous analysis

Make no mistake of taking this rally for a reversal or end of correction.  Bitcoin -1.59%  will go down to $5,000 and it will break market structure doing that. This is exactly what happened in 2014. There was this whole debate about whether  Bitcoin -1.59%  is following 2013 or 2014. Some said, 2013, some said 2014. Apparently, both events appeared mutually exclusive, but something more surprising has happened which has made me even more  bullish  on  Bitcoin -1.59%  long term. In my next analysis on Monday, I will explain how  Bitcoin -1.59%  is following both 2013 and 2014 at the same time! Stay tuned. Follow for updates.

Yesterday was a good day for  BTC -1.59%  - it seems we have double bottomed and reversed which has left us in a sideways pattern around 6400. 

$6400 has always been mentioned as a major  resistance level .  The current pattern continues to challenge 6400 and hopefully we have the momentum to break through it before we challenge 6800 and 7200. 

In the short term - low  volume  could keep us moving sideways.  This pattern should be the beginning of a few patterns - particularly another  H&S  if the chart forms a head. 

The only trades worth making right now are buys.  We will have to wait until we make it above 6800 before we can determine if we are going to be able to break through 7200 or if we will be pushed down again before making another run. 

If we see a head form - a short opportunity may present itself as a right side is carved out.   For those of you who are looking to long - these are the best prices we have seen in some time.

It has been a long weekend for me as I'm continuing to move house. Just whilst I have a moment I'd like to update everybody on what  Bitcoin -1.59%  is doing and how to trade it professionally! 

Another follow up analysis of Bitcoin! Price has moved strongly to the upside since I predicted an up move at support at 5790, so the analysis is running perfectly. Price has now stopped a side-wards  resistance level  at 6400. (See related ideas for more information regarding this analysis) Now, price looks like it's had a minor rounded top that started on 30th June and has continued since.  

There is a short term horizontal  support zone  between 6280 and 6180, which also coincides with the 20 and 50 moving average converged support. This is the logical place to first look for price to correct to, before buying to the upside. Also, if price goes into the horizontal  support zone  as I'm predicting then price will also hit  Fibonacci retracement  support, meaning there will be a compelling launch pad for price to go to the upside. 

When price hits the  support zone  watch for a buy, with a view of holding  Bitcoin -1.59%  until the next  structure resistance , which is the only real logical level to hold, at 6820 to 6925.  

Bear in mind if price doesn't go below 6320, then it might not even correct at the horizontal  support zone  mentioned for the up move. So you need to keep a sharp eye on price action at around this level. 

I will update this analysis throughout if it receives sufficient attention.

I've marked off some nice  supply and demand  levels on the 2H-TF, my take is that  BTC -1.55%  will be consolidating between a roughly $1000 trading range. After last week bull run  BTC -1.55%  is now making a bullflag and it's held up by demand D1. My take is that  BTC -1.55%  wants to move further up to test supply S1, the only question is how far will  BTC -1.55%  retrace before moving further up, that is do we get a pullback to demand D1 or to D2. Either way I will be looking for a buy entry on the lower timeframes

1530449953.0,SkyRockSignals,BTCUSD Long term scenario,"
On the 1-day timeframe chart long term  BTC -1.55%  analysis suggests that  BTC -1.55%  finally gains strength. There should be a new rally soon, it wont we similar to the previous where  BTC -1.55%  was pumped however it will be a gradual rise within months till the middle of the Autumn. It doesn't look like this time  BTC -1.55%  will fail again. There are a much more solid technical and fundamental foundation this time.  

Ichi cloud lines intersection and XABCD pattern with repeated BB contraction suggest that there should be trend reverse. This is confirmed by regular  bullish divergence  and price movement in the median channel. 

Nevertheless there are a high possibility of decrease in the short term. On the large timeframe scale it can be seen that the price should go back to the critical  support level  around $5900. There will be more thorough analysis of short term timeframe chart later. 

Still there is no guarantee of a great and smooth rally. When it consolidates around support line in the short term there will be new wave of growth which can be accompanied by drawbacks or sharp rises.  

We have a very strong rally foundation now the only problem is that the market is still not confident to just buy and FOMO again. Trust has been destroyed during two last month of market falls. So there is a big chance  BTC -1.55%  will go sideways in the mid term after short term consolidation. 

Conclusion: current  BTC -1.55%  price rise is only upward correction of a downtrend in the short term. The price will move to the mentioned on the chart zone. However according to analysis in the long term the price should move upward after that till Autumn. Moreover in the mid term there is a chance of sideways movement.  

Breaking $10 000 level will be a strong sign of a new wave of growth which will be confirmed after consolidation around $11 360

 BTC -1.51%  will certainly have another leg up towards 7000$ from there I think the selling pressure will force  btc -1.51%  to pullback to 6500, we need to see a daily higher low to form in the 6500 area to have a shift in the downtrend.

My take is that  BTC -1.51%  wants to move further up to test supply S1, the only question is how far will  BTC -1.51%  retrace before moving further up, that is do we get a pullback to demand D1 or to D2. Either way I will be looking for a buy entry on the lower timeframes

On the 1-day timeframe chart long term  BTC -1.51%  analysis suggests that  BTC -1.51%  finally gains strength. There should be a new rally soon, it wont we similar to the previous where  BTC -1.51%  was pumped however it will be a gradual rise within months till the middle of the Autumn. It doesn't look like this time  BTC -1.51%  will fail again. There are a much more solid technical and fundamental foundation this time.  

Ichi cloud lines intersection and XABCD pattern with repeated BB contraction suggest that there should be trend reverse. This is confirmed by regular  bullish divergence  and price movement in the median channel. 

Nevertheless there are a high possibility of decrease in the short term. On the large timeframe scale it can be seen that the price should go back to the critical  support level  around $5900. There will be more thorough analysis of short term timeframe chart later. 

Still there is no guarantee of a great and smooth rally. When it consolidates around support line in the short term there will be new wave of growth which can be accompanied by drawbacks or sharp rises.  

We have a very strong rally foundation now the only problem is that the market is still not confident to just buy and FOMO again. Trust has been destroyed during two last month of market falls. So there is a big chance  BTC -1.51%  will go sideways in the mid term after short term consolidation. 

Conclusion: current  BTC -1.51%  price rise is only upward correction of a downtrend in the short term. The price will move to the mentioned on the chart zone. However according to analysis in the long term the price should move upward after that till Autumn. Moreover in the mid term there is a chance of sideways movement.

 BTC -1.43%  will certainly have another leg up towards 7000$ from there I think the selling pressure will force  btc -1.43%  to pullback to 6500, we need to see a daily higher low to form in the 6500 area to have a shift in the downtrend.

A more thorough analysis of the Short term situation is presented on this chart. 

If  BTC -1.43%  manages to break through the resistance of $6500 and consolidate itself higher, then the price will have the opportunity to test the level of $7000. However the more probable opportunity is a slow and small rise after which there will be a decline to the lower edge of  Ichimoku cloud . In case of not overcoming resistance to the support range $6100-6000. The next step will be a reduction to the long term critical support around $5600-5900 up from which there will be a gradual rise which was described in the previous analysis

Make no mistake of taking this rally for a reversal or end of correction.  Bitcoin -1.39%  will go down to $5,000 and it will break market structure doing that. This is exactly what happened in 2014. There was this whole debate about whether  Bitcoin -1.39%  is following 2013 or 2014. Some said, 2013, some said 2014. Apparently, both events appeared mutually exclusive, but something more surprising has happened which has made me even more  bullish  on  Bitcoin -1.39%  long term. In my next analysis on Monday, I will explain how  Bitcoin -1.39%  is following both 2013 and 2014 at the same time! Stay tuned. Follow for updates.

Yesterday was a good day for  BTC -1.39%  - it seems we have double bottomed and reversed which has left us in a sideways pattern around 6400. 

$6400 has always been mentioned as a major  resistance level .  The current pattern continues to challenge 6400 and hopefully we have the momentum to break through it before we challenge 6800 and 7200. 

In the short term - low  volume  could keep us moving sideways.  This pattern should be the beginning of a few patterns - particularly another  H&S  if the chart forms a head. 

The only trades worth making right now are buys.  We will have to wait until we make it above 6800 before we can determine if we are going to be able to break through 7200 or if we will be pushed down again before making another run. 

If we see a head form - a short opportunity may present itself as a right side is carved out.   For those of you who are looking to long - these are the best prices we have seen in some time.

It has been a long weekend for me as I'm continuing to move house. Just whilst I have a moment I'd like to update everybody on what  Bitcoin -1.39%  is doing and how to trade it professionally! 

Another follow up analysis of Bitcoin! Price has moved strongly to the upside since I predicted an up move at support at 5790, so the analysis is running perfectly. Price has now stopped a side-wards  resistance level  at 6400. (See related ideas for more information regarding this analysis) Now, price looks like it's had a minor rounded top that started on 30th June and has continued since.  

There is a short term horizontal  support zone  between 6280 and 6180, which also coincides with the 20 and 50 moving average converged support. This is the logical place to first look for price to correct to, before buying to the upside. Also, if price goes into the horizontal  support zone  as I'm predicting then price will also hit  Fibonacci retracement  support, meaning there will be a compelling launch pad for price to go to the upside. 

When price hits the  support zone  watch for a buy, with a view of holding  Bitcoin -1.39%  until the next  structure resistance , which is the only real logical level to hold, at 6820 to 6925.  

Bear in mind if price doesn't go below 6320, then it might not even correct at the horizontal  support zone  mentioned for the up move. So you need to keep a sharp eye on price action at around this level. 

I will update this analysis throughout if it receives sufficient attention.

The only trades worth making right now are buys.  We will have to wait until we make it above 6800 before we can determine if we are going to be able to break through 7200 or if we will be pushed down again before making another run. 

If we see a head form - a short opportunity may present itself as a right side is carved out.   For those of you who are looking to long - these are the best prices we have seen in some time.

It has been a long weekend for me as I'm continuing to move house. Just whilst I have a moment I'd like to update everybody on what  Bitcoin -1.39%  is doing and how to trade it professionally! 

Another follow up analysis of Bitcoin! Price has moved strongly to the upside since I predicted an up move at support at 5790, so the analysis is running perfectly. Price has now stopped a side-wards  resistance level  at 6400. (See related ideas for more information regarding this analysis) Now, price looks like it's had a minor rounded top that started on 30th June and has continued since.  

There is a short term horizontal  support zone  between 6280 and 6180, which also coincides with the 20 and 50 moving average converged support. This is the logical place to first look for price to correct to, before buying to the upside. Also, if price goes into the horizontal  support zone  as I'm predicting then price will also hit  Fibonacci retracement  support, meaning there will be a compelling launch pad for price to go to the upside. 

When price hits the  support zone  watch for a buy, with a view of holding  Bitcoin -1.39%  until the next  structure resistance , which is the only real logical level to hold, at 6820 to 6925.  

Bear in mind if price doesn't go below 6320, then it might not even correct at the horizontal  support zone  mentioned for the up move. So you need to keep a sharp eye on price action at around this level. 

I will update this analysis throughout if it receives sufficient attention.

I've marked off some nice  supply and demand  levels on the 2H-TF, my take is that  BTC              will be consolidating between a roughly $1000 trading range. After last week bull run  BTC              is now making a bullflag and it's held up by demand D1. My take is that  BTC              wants to move further up to test supply S1, the only question is how far will  BTC              retrace before moving further up, that is do we get a pullback to demand D1 or to D2. Either way I will be looking for a buy entry on the lower timeframes

On the 1-day timeframe chart long term  BTC -1.39%  analysis suggests that  BTC -1.39%  finally gains strength. There should be a new rally soon, it wont we similar to the previous where  BTC -1.39%  was pumped however it will be a gradual rise within months till the middle of the Autumn. It doesn't look like this time  BTC -1.39%  will fail again. There are a much more solid technical and fundamental foundation this time.  

Ichi cloud lines intersection and XABCD pattern with repeated BB contraction suggest that there should be trend reverse. This is confirmed by regular  bullish divergence  and price movement in the median channel. 

Nevertheless there are a high possibility of decrease in the short term. On the large timeframe scale it can be seen that the price should go back to the critical  support level  around $5900. There will be more thorough analysis of short term timeframe chart later. 

Still there is no guarantee of a great and smooth rally. When it consolidates around support line in the short term there will be new wave of growth which can be accompanied by drawbacks or sharp rises.  

We have a very strong rally foundation now the only problem is that the market is still not confident to just buy and FOMO again. Trust has been destroyed during two last month of market falls. So there is a big chance  BTC -1.39%  will go sideways in the mid term after short term consolidation. 

Conclusion: current  BTC -1.39%  price rise is only upward correction of a downtrend in the short term. The price will move to the mentioned on the chart zone. However according to analysis in the long term the price should move upward after that till Autumn. Moreover in the mid term there is a chance of sideways movement.

 BTC -1.39%  will certainly have another leg up towards 7000$ from there I think the selling pressure will force  btc -1.39%  to pullback to 6500, we need to see a daily higher low to form in the 6500 area to have a shift in the downtrend.

A more thorough analysis of the Short term situation is presented on this chart. 

If  BTC -1.39%  manages to break through the resistance of $6500 and consolidate itself higher, then the price will have the opportunity to test the level of $7000. However the more probable opportunity is a slow and small rise after which there will be a decline to the lower edge of  Ichimoku cloud . In case of not overcoming resistance to the support range $6100-6000. The next step will be a reduction to the long term critical support around $5600-5900 up from which there will be a gradual rise which was described in the previous analysis

Make no mistake of taking this rally for a reversal or end of correction.  Bitcoin -1.39%  will go down to $5,000 and it will break market structure doing that. This is exactly what happened in 2014. There was this whole debate about whether  Bitcoin -1.39%  is following 2013 or 2014. Some said, 2013, some said 2014. Apparently, both events appeared mutually exclusive, but something more surprising has happened which has made me even more  bullish  on  Bitcoin -1.39%  long term. In my next analysis on Monday, I will explain how  Bitcoin -1.39%  is following both 2013 and 2014 at the same time! Stay tuned. Follow for updates.

However the more probable opportunity is a slow and small rise after which there will be a decline to the lower edge of  Ichimoku cloud . In case of not overcoming resistance to the support range $6100-6000. The next step will be a reduction to the long term critical support around $5600-5900 up from which there will be a gradual rise which was described in the previous analysis

Make no mistake of taking this rally for a reversal or end of correction.  Bitcoin              will go down to $5,000 and it will break market structure doing that. This is exactly what happened in 2014. There was this whole debate about whether  Bitcoin              is following 2013 or 2014. Some said, 2013, some said 2014. Apparently, both events appeared mutually exclusive, but something more surprising has happened which has made me even more  bullish  on  Bitcoin              long term. In my next analysis on Monday, I will explain how  Bitcoin              is following both 2013 and 2014 at the same time! Stay tuned. Follow for updates.

Yesterday was a good day for  BTC -1.39%  - it seems we have double bottomed and reversed which has left us in a sideways pattern around 6400. 

$6400 has always been mentioned as a major  resistance level .  The current pattern continues to challenge 6400 and hopefully we have the momentum to break through it before we challenge 6800 and 7200. 

In the short term - low  volume  could keep us moving sideways.  This pattern should be the beginning of a few patterns - particularly another  H&S  if the chart forms a head. 

The only trades worth making right now are buys.  We will have to wait until we make it above 6800 before we can determine if we are going to be able to break through 7200 or if we will be pushed down again before making another run. 

If we see a head form - a short opportunity may present itself as a right side is carved out.   For those of you who are looking to long - these are the best prices we have seen in some time.

It has been a long weekend for me as I'm continuing to move house. Just whilst I have a moment I'd like to update everybody on what  Bitcoin              is doing and how to trade it professionally! 

Another follow up analysis of Bitcoin! Price has moved strongly to the upside since I predicted an up move at support at 5790, so the analysis is running perfectly. Price has now stopped a side-wards  resistance level  at 6400. (See related ideas for more information regarding this analysis) Now, price looks like it's had a minor rounded top that started on 30th June and has continued since.  

There is a short term horizontal  support zone  between 6280 and 6180, which also coincides with the 20 and 50 moving average converged support. This is the logical place to first look for price to correct to, before buying to the upside. Also, if price goes into the horizontal  support zone  as I'm predicting then price will also hit  Fibonacci retracement  support, meaning there will be a compelling launch pad for price to go to the upside. 

When price hits the  support zone  watch for a buy, with a view of holding  Bitcoin              until the next  structure resistance , which is the only real logical level to hold, at 6820 to 6925.  

Bear in mind if price doesn't go below 6320, then it might not even correct at the horizontal  support zone  mentioned for the up move. So you need to keep a sharp eye on price action at around this level. 

I will update this analysis throughout if it receives sufficient attention.

I've marked off some nice  supply and demand  levels on the 2H-TF, my take is that  BTC -1.39%  will be consolidating between a roughly $1000 trading range. After last week bull run  BTC -1.39%  is now making a bullflag and it's held up by demand D1. My take is that  BTC -1.39%  wants to move further up to test supply S1, the only question is how far will  BTC -1.39%  retrace before moving further up, that is do we get a pullback to demand D1 or to D2. Either way I will be looking for a buy entry on the lower timeframes

1530449953.0,SkyRockSignals,BTCUSD Long term scenario,"
On the 1-day timeframe chart long term  BTC -1.39%  analysis suggests that  BTC -1.39%  finally gains strength. There should be a new rally soon, it wont we similar to the previous where  BTC -1.39%  was pumped however it will be a gradual rise within months till the middle of the Autumn. It doesn't look like this time  BTC -1.39%  will fail again. There are a much more solid technical and fundamental foundation this time.  

Ichi cloud lines intersection and XABCD pattern with repeated BB contraction suggest that there should be trend reverse. This is confirmed by regular  bullish divergence  and price movement in the median channel. 

Nevertheless there are a high possibility of decrease in the short term. On the large timeframe scale it can be seen that the price should go back to the critical  support level  around $5900. There will be more thorough analysis of short term timeframe chart later. 

Still there is no guarantee of a great and smooth rally. When it consolidates around support line in the short term there will be new wave of growth which can be accompanied by drawbacks or sharp rises.  

We have a very strong rally foundation now the only problem is that the market is still not confident to just buy and FOMO again. Trust has been destroyed during two last month of market falls. So there is a big chance  BTC -1.39%  will go sideways in the mid term after short term consolidation. 

Conclusion: current  BTC -1.39%  price rise is only upward correction of a downtrend in the short term. The price will move to the mentioned on the chart zone. However according to analysis in the long term the price should move upward after that till Autumn. Moreover in the mid term there is a chance of sideways movement.  

Breaking $10 000 level will be a strong sign of a new wave of growth which will be confirmed after consolidation around $11 360

 BTC -1.39%  will certainly have another leg up towards 7000$ from there I think the selling pressure will force  btc -1.39%  to pullback to 6500, we need to see a daily higher low to form in the 6500 area to have a shift in the downtrend.

Still there is no guarantee of a great and smooth rally. When it consolidates around support line in the short term there will be new wave of growth which can be accompanied by drawbacks or sharp rises.  

We have a very strong rally foundation now the only problem is that the market is still not confident to just buy and FOMO again. Trust has been destroyed during two last month of market falls. So there is a big chance  BTC -1.38%  will go sideways in the mid term after short term consolidation. 

Conclusion: current  BTC -1.38%  price rise is only upward correction of a downtrend in the short term. The price will move to the mentioned on the chart zone. However according to analysis in the long term the price should move upward after that till Autumn. Moreover in the mid term there is a chance of sideways movement.  

Breaking $10 000 level will be a strong sign of a new wave of growth which will be confirmed after consolidation around $11 360

 BTC -1.35%  will certainly have another leg up towards 7000$ from there I think the selling pressure will force  btc -1.35%  to pullback to 6500, we need to see a daily higher low to form in the 6500 area to have a shift in the downtrend.

A more thorough analysis of the Short term situation is presented on this chart. 

If  BTC -1.35%  manages to break through the resistance of $6500 and consolidate itself higher, then the price will have the opportunity to test the level of $7000. However the more probable opportunity is a slow and small rise after which there will be a decline to the lower edge of  Ichimoku cloud . In case of not overcoming resistance to the support range $6100-6000. The next step will be a reduction to the long term critical support around $5600-5900 up from which there will be a gradual rise which was described in the previous analysis

Make no mistake of taking this rally for a reversal or end of correction.  Bitcoin              will go down to $5,000 and it will break market structure doing that. This is exactly what happened in 2014. There was this whole debate about whether  Bitcoin              is following 2013 or 2014. Some said, 2013, some said 2014. Apparently, both events appeared mutually exclusive, but something more surprising has happened which has made me even more  bullish  on  Bitcoin              long term.

Yesterday was a good day for  BTC -1.38%  - it seems we have double bottomed and reversed which has left us in a sideways pattern around 6400. 

$6400 has always been mentioned as a major  resistance level .  The current pattern continues to challenge 6400 and hopefully we have the momentum to break through it before we challenge 6800 and 7200. 

In the short term - low  volume  could keep us moving sideways.  This pattern should be the beginning of a few patterns - particularly another  H&S  if the chart forms a head. 

The only trades worth making right now are buys.  We will have to wait until we make it above 6800 before we can determine if we are going to be able to break through 7200 or if we will be pushed down again before making another run. 

If we see a head form - a short opportunity may present itself as a right side is carved out.   For those of you who are looking to long - these are the best prices we have seen in some time.

It has been a long weekend for me as I'm continuing to move house. Just whilst I have a moment I'd like to update everybody on what  Bitcoin -1.38%  is doing and how to trade it professionally! 

Another follow up analysis of Bitcoin! Price has moved strongly to the upside since I predicted an up move at support at 5790, so the analysis is running perfectly. Price has now stopped a side-wards  resistance level  at 6400. (See related ideas for more information regarding this analysis) Now, price looks like it's had a minor rounded top that started on 30th June and has continued since.  

There is a short term horizontal  support zone  between 6280 and 6180, which also coincides with the 20 and 50 moving average converged support. This is the logical place to first look for price to correct to, before buying to the upside. Also, if price goes into the horizontal  support zone  as I'm predicting then price will also hit  Fibonacci retracement  support, meaning there will be a compelling launch pad for price to go to the upside. 

When price hits the  support zone  watch for a buy, with a view of holding  Bitcoin -1.38%  until the next  structure resistance , which is the only real logical level to hold, at 6820 to 6925.  

Bear in mind if price doesn't go below 6320, then it might not even correct at the horizontal  support zone  mentioned for the up move. So you need to keep a sharp eye on price action at around this level. 

I will update this analysis throughout if it receives sufficient attention.

I've marked off some nice  supply and demand  levels on the 2H-TF, my take is that  BTC -1.38%  will be consolidating between a roughly $1000 trading range. After last week bull run  BTC -1.38%  is now making a bullflag and it's held up by demand D1. My take is that  BTC -1.38%  wants to move further up to test supply S1, the only question is how far will  BTC -1.38%  retrace before moving further up, that is do we get a pullback to demand D1 or to D2. Either way I will be looking for a buy entry on the lower timeframes

Also, if price goes into the horizontal  support zone  as I'm predicting then price will also hit  Fibonacci retracement  support, meaning there will be a compelling launch pad for price to go to the upside.

I've marked off some nice  supply and demand  levels on the 2H-TF, my take is that  BTC -1.38%  will be consolidating between a roughly $1000 trading range. After last week bull run  BTC -1.38%  is now making a bullflag and it's held up by demand D1. My take is that  BTC -1.38%  wants to move further up to test supply S1, the only question is how far will  BTC -1.38%  retrace before moving further up, that is do we get a pullback to demand D1 or to D2. Either way I will be looking for a buy entry on the lower timeframes

On the 1-day timeframe chart long term  BTC -1.38%  analysis suggests that  BTC -1.38%  finally gains strength. There should be a new rally soon, it wont we similar to the previous where  BTC -1.38%  was pumped however it will be a gradual rise within months till the middle of the Autumn. It doesn't look like this time  BTC -1.38%  will fail again. There are a much more solid technical and fundamental foundation this time.  

Ichi cloud lines intersection and XABCD pattern with repeated BB contraction suggest that there should be trend reverse. This is confirmed by regular  bullish divergence  and price movement in the median channel. 

Nevertheless there are a high possibility of decrease in the short term. On the large timeframe scale it can be seen that the price should go back to the critical  support level  around $5900. There will be more thorough analysis of short term timeframe chart later. 

Still there is no guarantee of a great and smooth rally. When it consolidates around support line in the short term there will be new wave of growth which can be accompanied by drawbacks or sharp rises.  

We have a very strong rally foundation now the only problem is that the market is still not confident to just buy and FOMO again. Trust has been destroyed during two last month of market falls. So there is a big chance  BTC -1.38%  will go sideways in the mid term after short term consolidation. 

Conclusion: current  BTC -1.38%  price rise is only upward correction of a downtrend in the short term. The price will move to the mentioned on the chart zone. However according to analysis in the long term the price should move upward after that till Autumn. Moreover in the mid term there is a chance of sideways movement.

 BTC -1.38%  will certainly have another leg up towards 7000$ from there I think the selling pressure will force  btc -1.38%  to pullback to 6500, we need to see a daily higher low to form in the 6500 area to have a shift in the downtrend.

A more thorough analysis of the Short term situation is presented on this chart. 

If  BTC -1.38%  manages to break through the resistance of $6500 and consolidate itself higher, then the price will have the opportunity to test the level of $7000. However the more probable opportunity is a slow and small rise after which there will be a decline to the lower edge of  Ichimoku cloud . In case of not overcoming resistance to the support range $6100-6000. The next step will be a reduction to the long term critical support around $5600-5900 up from which there will be a gradual rise which was described in the previous analysis

Make no mistake of taking this rally for a reversal or end of correction.  Bitcoin -1.38%  will go down to $5,000 and it will break market structure doing that. This is exactly what happened in 2014. There was this whole debate about whether  Bitcoin -1.38%  is following 2013 or 2014. Some said, 2013, some said 2014. Apparently, both events appeared mutually exclusive, but something more surprising has happened which has made me even more  bullish  on  Bitcoin -1.38%  long term. In my next analysis on Monday, I will explain how  Bitcoin -1.38%  is following both 2013 and 2014 at the same time! Stay tuned. Follow for updates.

Yesterday was a good day for  BTC -1.38%  - it seems we have double bottomed and reversed which has left us in a sideways pattern around 6400. 

$6400 has always been mentioned as a major  resistance level .  The current pattern continues to challenge 6400 and hopefully we have the momentum to break through it before we challenge 6800 and 7200. 

In the short term - low  volume  could keep us moving sideways.  This pattern should be the beginning of a few patterns - particularly another  H&S  if the chart forms a head. 

The only trades worth making right now are buys.  We will have to wait until we make it above 6800 before we can determine if we are going to be able to break through 7200 or if we will be pushed down again before making another run. 

If we see a head form - a short opportunity may present itself as a right side is carved out.   For those of you who are looking to long - these are the best prices we have seen in some time.

Make no mistake of taking this rally for a reversal or end of correction.  Bitcoin -1.38%  will go down to $5,000 and it will break market structure doing that. This is exactly what happened in 2014. There was this whole debate about whether  Bitcoin -1.38%  is following 2013 or 2014. Some said, 2013, some said 2014. Apparently, both events appeared mutually exclusive, but something more surprising has happened which has made me even more  bullish  on  Bitcoin -1.38%  long term. In my next analysis on Monday, I will explain how  Bitcoin -1.38%  is following both 2013 and 2014 at the same time! Stay tuned. Follow for updates.

Yesterday was a good day for  BTC -1.38%  - it seems we have double bottomed and reversed which has left us in a sideways pattern around 6400. 

$6400 has always been mentioned as a major  resistance level .  The current pattern continues to challenge 6400 and hopefully we have the momentum to break through it before we challenge 6800 and 7200. 

In the short term - low  volume  could keep us moving sideways.  This pattern should be the beginning of a few patterns - particularly another  H&S  if the chart forms a head. 

The only trades worth making right now are buys.  We will have to wait until we make it above 6800 before we can determine if we are going to be able to break through 7200 or if we will be pushed down again before making another run. 

If we see a head form - a short opportunity may present itself as a right side is carved out.   For those of you who are looking to long - these are the best prices we have seen in some time.

It has been a long weekend for me as I'm continuing to move house. Just whilst I have a moment I'd like to update everybody on what  Bitcoin              is doing and how to trade it professionally! 

Another follow up analysis of Bitcoin! Price has moved strongly to the upside since I predicted an up move at support at 5790, so the analysis is running perfectly. Price has now stopped a side-wards  resistance level  at 6400. (See related ideas for more information regarding this analysis) Now, price looks like it's had a minor rounded top that started on 30th June and has continued since.  

There is a short term horizontal  support zone  between 6280 and 6180, which also coincides with the 20 and 50 moving average converged support. This is the logical place to first look for price to correct to, before buying to the upside. Also, if price goes into the horizontal  support zone  as I'm predicting then price will also hit  Fibonacci retracement  support, meaning there will be a compelling launch pad for price to go to the upside. 

When price hits the  support zone  watch for a buy, with a view of holding  Bitcoin              until the next  structure resistance , which is the only real logical level to hold, at 6820 to 6925.  

Bear in mind if price doesn't go below 6320, then it might not even correct at the horizontal  support zone  mentioned for the up move. So you need to keep a sharp eye on price action at around this level. 

I will update this analysis throughout if it receives sufficient attention.

I've marked off some nice  supply and demand  levels on the 2H-TF, my take is that  BTC              will be consolidating between a roughly $1000 trading range. After last week bull run  BTC              is now making a bullflag and it's held up by demand D1. My take is that  BTC              wants to move further up to test supply S1, the only question is how far will  BTC              retrace before moving further up, that is do we get a pullback to demand D1 or to D2. Either way I will be looking for a buy entry on the lower timeframes

On the 1-day timeframe chart long term  BTC              analysis suggests that  BTC              finally gains strength. There should be a new rally soon, it wont we similar to the previous where  BTC              was pumped however it will be a gradual rise within months till the middle of the Autumn. It doesn't look like this time  BTC              will fail again. There are a much more solid technical and fundamental foundation this time.  

Ichi cloud lines intersection and XABCD pattern with repeated BB contraction suggest that there should be trend reverse. This is confirmed by regular  bullish divergence  and price movement in the median channel. 

Nevertheless there are a high possibility of decrease in the short term. On the large timeframe scale it can be seen that the price should go back to the critical  support level  around $5900. There will be more thorough analysis of short term timeframe chart later. 

Still there is no guarantee of a great and smooth rally. When it consolidates around support line in the short term there will be new wave of growth which can be accompanied by drawbacks or sharp rises.  

We have a very strong rally foundation now the only problem is that the market is still not confident to just buy and FOMO again. Trust has been destroyed during two last month of market falls. So there is a big chance  BTC              will go sideways in the mid term after short term consolidation. 

Conclusion: current  BTC              price rise is only upward correction of a downtrend in the short term. The price will move to the mentioned on the chart zone. However according to analysis in the long term the price should move upward after that till Autumn. Moreover in the mid term there is a chance of sideways movement.  

Breaking $10 000 level will be a strong sign of a new wave of growth which will be confirmed after consolidation around $11 360

 BTC              will certainly have another leg up towards 7000$ from there I think the selling pressure will force  btc              to pullback to 6500, we need to see a daily higher low to form in the 6500 area to have a shift in the downtrend.

A more thorough analysis of the Short term situation is presented on this chart. 

If  BTC              manages to break through the resistance of $6500 and consolidate itself higher, then the price will have the opportunity to test the level of $7000. However the more probable opportunity is a slow and small rise after which there will be a decline to the lower edge of  Ichimoku cloud . In case of not overcoming resistance to the support range $6100-6000. The next step will be a reduction to the long term critical support around $5600-5900 up from which there will be a gradual rise which was described in the previous analysis

 BTC -1.39%  will certainly have another leg up towards 7000$ from there I think the selling pressure will force  btc -1.39%  to pullback to 6500, we need to see a daily higher low to form in the 6500 area to have a shift in the downtrend.

A more thorough analysis of the Short term situation is presented on this chart. 

If  BTC -1.43%  manages to break through the resistance of $6500 and consolidate itself higher, then the price will have the opportunity to test the level of $7000. However the more probable opportunity is a slow and small rise after which there will be a decline to the lower edge of  Ichimoku cloud . In case of not overcoming resistance to the support range $6100-6000. The next step will be a reduction to the long term critical support around $5600-5900 up from which there will be a gradual rise which was described in the previous analysis

Make no mistake of taking this rally for a reversal or end of correction.  Bitcoin -1.43%  will go down to $5,000 and it will break market structure doing that. This is exactly what happened in 2014. There was this whole debate about whether  Bitcoin -1.43%  is following 2013 or 2014. Some said, 2013, some said 2014. Apparently, both events appeared mutually exclusive, but something more surprising has happened which has made me even more  bullish  on  Bitcoin -1.43%  long term. In my next analysis on Monday, I will explain how  Bitcoin -1.43%  is following both 2013 and 2014 at the same time! Stay tuned. Follow for updates.

Yesterday was a good day for  BTC -1.43%  - it seems we have double bottomed and reversed which has left us in a sideways pattern around 6400. 

$6400 has always been mentioned as a major  resistance level .  The current pattern continues to challenge 6400 and hopefully we have the momentum to break through it before we challenge 6800 and 7200. 

In the short term - low  volume  could keep us moving sideways.  This pattern should be the beginning of a few patterns - particularly another  H&S  if the chart forms a head. 

The only trades worth making right now are buys.  We will have to wait until we make it above 6800 before we can determine if we are going to be able to break through 7200 or if we will be pushed down again before making another run. 

If we see a head form - a short opportunity may present itself as a right side is carved out.   For those of you who are looking to long - these are the best prices we have seen in some time.

It has been a long weekend for me as I'm continuing to move house. Just whilst I have a moment I'd like to update everybody on what  Bitcoin -1.43%  is doing and how to trade it professionally! 

Another follow up analysis of Bitcoin! Price has moved strongly to the upside since I predicted an up move at support at 5790, so the analysis is running perfectly. Price has now stopped a side-wards  resistance level  at 6400. (See related ideas for more information regarding this analysis) Now, price looks like it's had a minor rounded top that started on 30th June and has continued since.  

There is a short term horizontal  support zone  between 6280 and 6180, which also coincides with the 20 and 50 moving average converged support. This is the logical place to first look for price to correct to, before buying to the upside. Also, if price goes into the horizontal  support zone  as I'm predicting then price will also hit  Fibonacci retracement  support, meaning there will be a compelling launch pad for price to go to the upside. 

When price hits the  support zone  watch for a buy, with a view of holding  Bitcoin -1.43%  until the next  structure resistance , which is the only real logical level to hold, at 6820 to 6925.  

Bear in mind if price doesn't go below 6320, then it might not even correct at the horizontal  support zone  mentioned for the up move. So you need to keep a sharp eye on price action at around this level. 

I will update this analysis throughout if it receives sufficient attention.

I've marked off some nice  supply and demand  levels on the 2H-TF, my take is that  BTC -1.43%  will be consolidating between a roughly $1000 trading range. After last week bull run  BTC -1.43%  is now making a bullflag and it's held up by demand D1. My take is that  BTC -1.43%  wants to move further up to test supply S1, the only question is how far will  BTC -1.43%  retrace before moving further up, that is do we get a pullback to demand D1 or to D2. Either way I will be looking for a buy entry on the lower timeframes

1530449953.0,SkyRockSignals,BTCUSD Long term scenario,"
On the 1-day timeframe chart long term  BTC -1.43%  analysis suggests that  BTC -1.43%  finally gains strength. There should be a new rally soon, it wont we similar to the previous where  BTC -1.43%  was pumped however it will be a gradual rise within months till the middle of the Autumn. It doesn't look like this time  BTC -1.43%  will fail again. There are a much more solid technical and fundamental foundation this time.  

Ichi cloud lines intersection and XABCD pattern with repeated BB contraction suggest that there should be trend reverse. This is confirmed by regular  bullish divergence  and price movement in the median channel. 

Nevertheless there are a high possibility of decrease in the short term. On the large timeframe scale it can be seen that the price should go back to the critical  support level  around $5900. There will be more thorough analysis of short term timeframe chart later. 

Still there is no guarantee of a great and smooth rally. When it consolidates around support line in the short term there will be new wave of growth which can be accompanied by drawbacks or sharp rises.  

We have a very strong rally foundation now the only problem is that the market is still not confident to just buy and FOMO again. Trust has been destroyed during two last month of market falls. So there is a big chance  BTC -1.43%  will go sideways in the mid term after short term consolidation. 

Conclusion: current  BTC -1.43%  price rise is only upward correction of a downtrend in the short term. The price will move to the mentioned on the chart zone. However according to analysis in the long term the price should move upward after that till Autumn. Moreover in the mid term there is a chance of sideways movement.  

Breaking $10 000 level will be a strong sign of a new wave of growth which will be confirmed after consolidation around $11 360

I've marked off some nice  supply and demand  levels on the 2H-TF, my take is that  BTC -1.43%  will be consolidating between a roughly $1000 trading range. After last week bull run  BTC -1.43%  is now making a bullflag and it's held up by demand D1. My take is that  BTC -1.43%  wants to move further up to test supply S1, the only question is how far will  BTC -1.43%  retrace before moving further up, that is do we get a pullback to demand D1 or to D2. Either way I will be looking for a buy entry on the lower timeframes

On the 1-day timeframe chart long term  BTC -1.43%  analysis suggests that  BTC -1.43%  finally gains strength. There should be a new rally soon, it wont we similar to the previous where  BTC -1.43%  was pumped however it will be a gradual rise within months till the middle of the Autumn. It doesn't look like this time  BTC -1.43%  will fail again. There are a much more solid technical and fundamental foundation this time.  

Ichi cloud lines intersection and XABCD pattern with repeated BB contraction suggest that there should be trend reverse. This is confirmed by regular  bullish divergence  and price movement in the median channel. 

Nevertheless there are a high possibility of decrease in the short term. On the large timeframe scale it can be seen that the price should go back to the critical  support level  around $5900. There will be more thorough analysis of short term timeframe chart later. 

Still there is no guarantee of a great and smooth rally. When it consolidates around support line in the short term there will be new wave of growth which can be accompanied by drawbacks or sharp rises.  

We have a very strong rally foundation now the only problem is that the market is still not confident to just buy and FOMO again. Trust has been destroyed during two last month of market falls. So there is a big chance  BTC -1.43%  will go sideways in the mid term after short term consolidation. 

Conclusion: current  BTC -1.43%  price rise is only upward correction of a downtrend in the short term. The price will move to the mentioned on the chart zone. However according to analysis in the long term the price should move upward after that till Autumn. Moreover in the mid term there is a chance of sideways movement.  

Breaking $10 000 level will be a strong sign of a new wave of growth which will be confirmed after consolidation around $11 360

 BTC -1.43%  will certainly have another leg up towards 7000$ from there I think the selling pressure will force  btc -1.43%  to pullback to 6500, we need to see a daily higher low to form in the 6500 area to have a shift in the downtrend.

A more thorough analysis of the Short term situation is presented on this chart. 

If  BTC -1.43%  manages to break through the resistance of $6500 and consolidate itself higher, then the price will have the opportunity to test the level of $7000. However the more probable opportunity is a slow and small rise after which there will be a decline to the lower edge of  Ichimoku cloud . In case of not overcoming resistance to the support range $6100-6000. The next step will be a reduction to the long term critical support around $5600-5900 up from which there will be a gradual rise which was described in the previous analysis

Make no mistake of taking this rally for a reversal or end of correction.  Bitcoin -1.43%  will go down to $5,000 and it will break market structure doing that. This is exactly what happened in 2014. There was this whole debate about whether  Bitcoin -1.43%  is following 2013 or 2014. Some said, 2013, some said 2014. Apparently, both events appeared mutually exclusive, but something more surprising has happened which has made me even more  bullish  on  Bitcoin -1.43%  long term.

Yesterday was a good day for  BTC -1.43%  - it seems we have double bottomed and reversed which has left us in a sideways pattern around 6400. 

$6400 has always been mentioned as a major  resistance level .  The current pattern continues to challenge 6400 and hopefully we have the momentum to break through it before we challenge 6800 and 7200. 

In the short term - low  volume  could keep us moving sideways.  This pattern should be the beginning of a few patterns - particularly another  H&S  if the chart forms a head. 

The only trades worth making right now are buys.  We will have to wait until we make it above 6800 before we can determine if we are going to be able to break through 7200 or if we will be pushed down again before making another run. 

If we see a head form - a short opportunity may present itself as a right side is carved out.   For those of you who are looking to long - these are the best prices we have seen in some time.

It has been a long weekend for me as I'm continuing to move house. Just whilst I have a moment I'd like to update everybody on what  Bitcoin -1.43%  is doing and how to trade it professionally! 

Another follow up analysis of Bitcoin! Price has moved strongly to the upside since I predicted an up move at support at 5790, so the analysis is running perfectly. Price has now stopped a side-wards  resistance level  at 6400. (See related ideas for more information regarding this analysis) Now, price looks like it's had a minor rounded top that started on 30th June and has continued since.  

There is a short term horizontal  support zone  between 6280 and 6180, which also coincides with the 20 and 50 moving average converged support. This is the logical place to first look for price to correct to, before buying to the upside. Also, if price goes into the horizontal  support zone  as I'm predicting then price will also hit  Fibonacci retracement  support, meaning there will be a compelling launch pad for price to go to the upside. 

When price hits the  support zone  watch for a buy, with a view of holding  Bitcoin -1.43%  until the next  structure resistance , which is the only real logical level to hold, at 6820 to 6925.  

Bear in mind if price doesn't go below 6320, then it might not even correct at the horizontal  support zone  mentioned for the up move. So you need to keep a sharp eye on price action at around this level. 

I will update this analysis throughout if it receives sufficient attention.

Yesterday was a good day for  BTC -1.48%  - it seems we have double bottomed and reversed which has left us in a sideways pattern around 6400. 

$6400 has always been mentioned as a major  resistance level .  The current pattern continues to challenge 6400 and hopefully we have the momentum to break through it before we challenge 6800 and 7200. 

In the short term - low  volume  could keep us moving sideways.  This pattern should be the beginning of a few patterns - particularly another  H&S  if the chart forms a head. 

The only trades worth making right now are buys.  We will have to wait until we make it above 6800 before we can determine if we are going to be able to break through 7200 or if we will be pushed down again before making another run. 

If we see a head form - a short opportunity may present itself as a right side is carved out.   For those of you who are looking to long - these are the best prices we have seen in some time.

It has been a long weekend for me as I'm continuing to move house. Just whilst I have a moment I'd like to update everybody on what  Bitcoin -1.48%  is doing and how to trade it professionally! 

Another follow up analysis of Bitcoin! Price has moved strongly to the upside since I predicted an up move at support at 5790, so the analysis is running perfectly. Price has now stopped a side-wards  resistance level  at 6400. (See related ideas for more information regarding this analysis) Now, price looks like it's had a minor rounded top that started on 30th June and has continued since.  

There is a short term horizontal  support zone  between 6280 and 6180, which also coincides with the 20 and 50 moving average converged support. This is the logical place to first look for price to correct to, before buying to the upside. Also, if price goes into the horizontal  support zone  as I'm predicting then price will also hit  Fibonacci retracement  support, meaning there will be a compelling launch pad for price to go to the upside. 

When price hits the  support zone  watch for a buy, with a view of holding  Bitcoin -1.48%  until the next  structure resistance , which is the only real logical level to hold, at 6820 to 6925.  

Bear in mind if price doesn't go below 6320, then it might not even correct at the horizontal  support zone  mentioned for the up move. So you need to keep a sharp eye on price action at around this level. 

I will update this analysis throughout if it receives sufficient attention.

I've marked off some nice  supply and demand  levels on the 2H-TF, my take is that  BTC              will be consolidating between a roughly $1000 trading range. After last week bull run  BTC              is now making a bullflag and it's held up by demand D1. My take is that  BTC              wants to move further up to test supply S1, the only question is how far will  BTC              retrace before moving further up, that is do we get a pullback to demand D1 or to D2. Either way I will be looking for a buy entry on the lower timeframes

On the 1-day timeframe chart long term  BTC -1.49%  analysis suggests that  BTC -1.49%  finally gains strength. There should be a new rally soon, it wont we similar to the previous where  BTC -1.49%  was pumped however it will be a gradual rise within months till the middle of the Autumn. It doesn't look like this time  BTC -1.49%  will fail again. There are a much more solid technical and fundamental foundation this time.  

Ichi cloud lines intersection and XABCD pattern with repeated BB contraction suggest that there should be trend reverse. This is confirmed by regular  bullish divergence  and price movement in the median channel. 

Nevertheless there are a high possibility of decrease in the short term. On the large timeframe scale it can be seen that the price should go back to the critical  support level  around $5900. There will be more thorough analysis of short term timeframe chart later. 

Still there is no guarantee of a great and smooth rally. When it consolidates around support line in the short term there will be new wave of growth which can be accompanied by drawbacks or sharp rises.  

We have a very strong rally foundation now the only problem is that the market is still not confident to just buy and FOMO again. Trust has been destroyed during two last month of market falls. So there is a big chance  BTC -1.49%  will go sideways in the mid term after short term consolidation. 

Conclusion: current  BTC -1.49%  price rise is only upward correction of a downtrend in the short term. The price will move to the mentioned on the chart zone. However according to analysis in the long term the price should move upward after that till Autumn. Moreover in the mid term there is a chance of sideways movement.  

Breaking $10 000 level will be a strong sign of a new wave of growth which will be confirmed after consolidation around $11 360

 BTC              will certainly have another leg up towards 7000$ from there I think the selling pressure will force  btc              to pullback to 6500, we need to see a daily higher low to form in the 6500 area to have a shift in the downtrend.

A more thorough analysis of the Short term situation is presented on this chart. 

If  BTC -1.51%  manages to break through the resistance of $6500 and consolidate itself higher, then the price will have the opportunity to test the level of $7000. However the more probable opportunity is a slow and small rise after which there will be a decline to the lower edge of  Ichimoku cloud . In case of not overcoming resistance to the support range $6100-6000. The next step will be a reduction to the long term critical support around $5600-5900 up from which there will be a gradual rise which was described in the previous analysis

Make no mistake of taking this rally for a reversal or end of correction.  Bitcoin -1.51%  will go down to $5,000 and it will break market structure doing that. This is exactly what happened in 2014. There was this whole debate about whether  Bitcoin -1.51%  is following 2013 or 2014. Some said, 2013, some said 2014. Apparently, both events appeared mutually exclusive, but something more surprising has happened which has made me even more  bullish  on  Bitcoin -1.51%  long term. In my next analysis on Monday, I will explain how  Bitcoin -1.51%  is following both 2013 and 2014 at the same time! Stay tuned. Follow for updates.

A more thorough analysis of the Short term situation is presented on this chart. 

If  BTC -1.51%  manages to break through the resistance of $6500 and consolidate itself higher, then the price will have the opportunity to test the level of $7000. However the more probable opportunity is a slow and small rise after which there will be a decline to the lower edge of  Ichimoku cloud . In case of not overcoming resistance to the support range $6100-6000. The next step will be a reduction to the long term critical support around $5600-5900 up from which there will be a gradual rise which was described in the previous analysis

Make no mistake of taking this rally for a reversal or end of correction.  Bitcoin              will go down to $5,000 and it will break market structure doing that. This is exactly what happened in 2014. There was this whole debate about whether  Bitcoin              is following 2013 or 2014. Some said, 2013, some said 2014. Apparently, both events appeared mutually exclusive, but something more surprising has happened which has made me even more  bullish  on  Bitcoin              long term. In my next analysis on Monday, I will explain how  Bitcoin              is following both 2013 and 2014 at the same time! Stay tuned. Follow for updates.

Yesterday was a good day for  BTC -1.51%  - it seems we have double bottomed and reversed which has left us in a sideways pattern around 6400. 

$6400 has always been mentioned as a major  resistance level .  The current pattern continues to challenge 6400 and hopefully we have the momentum to break through it before we challenge 6800 and 7200. 

In the short term - low  volume  could keep us moving sideways.  This pattern should be the beginning of a few patterns - particularly another  H&S  if the chart forms a head. 

The only trades worth making right now are buys.  We will have to wait until we make it above 6800 before we can determine if we are going to be able to break through 7200 or if we will be pushed down again before making another run. 

If we see a head form - a short opportunity may present itself as a right side is carved out.   For those of you who are looking to long - these are the best prices we have seen in some time.

It has been a long weekend for me as I'm continuing to move house. Just whilst I have a moment I'd like to update everybody on what  Bitcoin -1.51%  is doing and how to trade it professionally! 

Another follow up analysis of Bitcoin! Price has moved strongly to the upside since I predicted an up move at support at 5790, so the analysis is running perfectly. Price has now stopped a side-wards  resistance level  at 6400. (See related ideas for more information regarding this analysis) Now, price looks like it's had a minor rounded top that started on 30th June and has continued since.  

There is a short term horizontal  support zone  between 6280 and 6180, which also coincides with the 20 and 50 moving average converged support. This is the logical place to first look for price to correct to, before buying to the upside. Also, if price goes into the horizontal  support zone  as I'm predicting then price will also hit  Fibonacci retracement  support, meaning there will be a compelling launch pad for price to go to the upside. 

When price hits the  support zone  watch for a buy, with a view of holding  Bitcoin -1.51%  until the next  structure resistance , which is the only real logical level to hold, at 6820 to 6925.  

Bear in mind if price doesn't go below 6320, then it might not even correct at the horizontal  support zone  mentioned for the up move. So you need to keep a sharp eye on price action at around this level. 

I will update this analysis throughout if it receives sufficient attention.

I've marked off some nice  supply and demand  levels on the 2H-TF, my take is that  BTC -1.51%  will be consolidating between a roughly $1000 trading range. After last week bull run  BTC -1.51%  is now making a bullflag and it's held up by demand D1. My take is that  BTC -1.51%  wants to move further up to test supply S1, the only question is how far will  BTC -1.51%  retrace before moving further up, that is do we get a pullback to demand D1 or to D2. Either way I will be looking for a buy entry on the lower timeframes

1530449953.0,SkyRockSignals,BTCUSD Long term scenario,"
On the 1-day timeframe chart long term  BTC -1.51%  analysis suggests that  BTC -1.51%  finally gains strength. There should be a new rally soon, it wont we similar to the previous where  BTC -1.51%  was pumped however it will be a gradual rise within months till the middle of the Autumn. It doesn't look like this time  BTC -1.51%  will fail again. There are a much more solid technical and fundamental foundation this time.  

Ichi cloud lines intersection and XABCD pattern with repeated BB contraction suggest that there should be trend reverse. This is confirmed by regular  bullish divergence  and price movement in the median channel. 

Nevertheless there are a high possibility of decrease in the short term. On the large timeframe scale it can be seen that the price should go back to the critical  support level  around $5900. There will be more thorough analysis of short term timeframe chart later. 

Still there is no guarantee of a great and smooth rally. When it consolidates around support line in the short term there will be new wave of growth which can be accompanied by drawbacks or sharp rises.  

We have a very strong rally foundation now the only problem is that the market is still not confident to just buy and FOMO again. Trust has been destroyed during two last month of market falls. So there is a big chance  BTC -1.51%  will go sideways in the mid term after short term consolidation. 

Conclusion: current  BTC -1.51%  price rise is only upward correction of a downtrend in the short term. The price will move to the mentioned on the chart zone. However according to analysis in the long term the price should move upward after that till Autumn. Moreover in the mid term there is a chance of sideways movement.  

Breaking $10 000 level will be a strong sign of a new wave of growth which will be confirmed after consolidation around $11 360

 BTC -1.51%  will certainly have another leg up towards 7000$ from there I think the selling pressure will force  btc -1.51%  to pullback to 6500, we need to see a daily higher low to form in the 6500 area to have a shift in the downtrend.

Nevertheless there are a high possibility of decrease in the short term. On the large timeframe scale it can be seen that the price should go back to the critical  support level  around $5900. There will be more thorough analysis of short term timeframe chart later. 

Still there is no guarantee of a great and smooth rally. When it consolidates around support line in the short term there will be new wave of growth which can be accompanied by drawbacks or sharp rises.  

We have a very strong rally foundation now the only problem is that the market is still not confident to just buy and FOMO again. Trust has been destroyed during two last month of market falls. So there is a big chance  BTC -1.51%  will go sideways in the mid term after short term consolidation. 

Conclusion: current  BTC -1.51%  price rise is only upward correction of a downtrend in the short term. The price will move to the mentioned on the chart zone. However according to analysis in the long term the price should move upward after that till Autumn. Moreover in the mid term there is a chance of sideways movement.  

Breaking $10 000 level will be a strong sign of a new wave of growth which will be confirmed after consolidation around $11 360

 BTC -1.51%  will certainly have another leg up towards 7000$ from there I think the selling pressure will force  btc -1.51%  to pullback to 6500, we need to see a daily higher low to form in the 6500 area to have a shift in the downtrend.

A more thorough analysis of the Short term situation is presented on this chart. 

If  BTC -1.51%  manages to break through the resistance of $6500 and consolidate itself higher, then the price will have the opportunity to test the level of $7000. However the more probable opportunity is a slow and small rise after which there will be a decline to the lower edge of  Ichimoku cloud . In case of not overcoming resistance to the support range $6100-6000. The next step will be a reduction to the long term critical support around $5600-5900 up from which there will be a gradual rise which was described in the previous analysis

Make no mistake of taking this rally for a reversal or end of correction.  Bitcoin -1.51%  will go down to $5,000 and it will break market structure doing that. This is exactly what happened in 2014. There was this whole debate about whether  Bitcoin -1.51%  is following 2013 or 2014. Some said, 2013, some said 2014. Apparently, both events appeared mutually exclusive, but something more surprising has happened which has made me even more  bullish  on  Bitcoin -1.51%  long term. In my next analysis on Monday, I will explain how  Bitcoin -1.51%  is following both 2013 and 2014 at the same time! Stay tuned. Follow for updates.

Yesterday was a good day for  BTC -1.51%  - it seems we have double bottomed and reversed which has left us in a sideways pattern around 6400. 

$6400 has always been mentioned as a major  resistance level .  The current pattern continues to challenge 6400 and hopefully we have the momentum to break through it before we challenge 6800 and 7200. 

In the short term - low  volume  could keep us moving sideways.  This pattern should be the beginning of a few patterns - particularly another  H&S  if the chart forms a head. 

The only trades worth making right now are buys.  We will have to wait until we make it above 6800 before we can determine if we are going to be able to break through 7200 or if we will be pushed down again before making another run. 

If we see a head form - a short opportunity may present itself as a right side is carved out.   For those of you who are looking to long - these are the best prices we have seen in some time.

It has been a long weekend for me as I'm continuing to move house. Just whilst I have a moment I'd like to update everybody on what  Bitcoin -1.51%  is doing and how to trade it professionally! 

Another follow up analysis of Bitcoin! Price has moved strongly to the upside since I predicted an up move at support at 5790, so the analysis is running perfectly. Price has now stopped a side-wards  resistance level  at 6400. (See related ideas for more information regarding this analysis) Now, price looks like it's had a minor rounded top that started on 30th June and has continued since.  

There is a short term horizontal  support zone  between 6280 and 6180, which also coincides with the 20 and 50 moving average converged support. This is the logical place to first look for price to correct to, before buying to the upside. Also, if price goes into the horizontal  support zone  as I'm predicting then price will also hit  Fibonacci retracement  support, meaning there will be a compelling launch pad for price to go to the upside. 

When price hits the  support zone  watch for a buy, with a view of holding  Bitcoin -1.51%  until the next  structure resistance , which is the only real logical level to hold, at 6820 to 6925.  

Bear in mind if price doesn't go below 6320, then it might not even correct at the horizontal  support zone  mentioned for the up move. So you need to keep a sharp eye on price action at around this level. 

I will update this analysis throughout if it receives sufficient attention.

I've marked off some nice  supply and demand  levels on the 2H-TF, my take is that  BTC -1.51%  will be consolidating between a roughly $1000 trading range. After last week bull run  BTC -1.51%  is now making a bullflag and it's held up by demand D1. My take is that  BTC -1.51%  wants to move further up to test supply S1, the only question is how far will  BTC -1.51%  retrace before moving further up, that is do we get a pullback to demand D1 or to D2. Either way I will be looking for a buy entry on the lower timeframes

(See related ideas for more information regarding this analysis) Now, price looks like it's had a minor rounded top that started on 30th June and has continued since.  

There is a short term horizontal  support zone  between 6280 and 6180, which also coincides with the 20 and 50 moving average converged support. This is the logical place to first look for price to correct to, before buying to the upside. Also, if price goes into the horizontal  support zone  as I'm predicting then price will also hit  Fibonacci retracement  support, meaning there will be a compelling launch pad for price to go to the upside. 

When price hits the  support zone  watch for a buy, with a view of holding  Bitcoin -1.51%  until the next  structure resistance , which is the only real logical level to hold, at 6820 to 6925.  

Bear in mind if price doesn't go below 6320, then it might not even correct at the horizontal  support zone  mentioned for the up move. So you need to keep a sharp eye on price action at around this level. 

I will update this analysis throughout if it receives sufficient attention.

I've marked off some nice  supply and demand  levels on the 2H-TF, my take is that  BTC -1.51%  will be consolidating between a roughly $1000 trading range. After last week bull run  BTC -1.51%  is now making a bullflag and it's held up by demand D1. My take is that  BTC -1.51%  wants to move further up to test supply S1, the only question is how far will  BTC -1.51%  retrace before moving further up, that is do we get a pullback to demand D1 or to D2. Either way I will be looking for a buy entry on the lower timeframes

On the 1-day timeframe chart long term  BTC -1.51%  analysis suggests that  BTC -1.51%  finally gains strength. There should be a new rally soon, it wont we similar to the previous where  BTC -1.51%  was pumped however it will be a gradual rise within months till the middle of the Autumn. It doesn't look like this time  BTC -1.51%  will fail again. There are a much more solid technical and fundamental foundation this time.  

Ichi cloud lines intersection and XABCD pattern with repeated BB contraction suggest that there should be trend reverse. This is confirmed by regular  bullish divergence  and price movement in the median channel. 

Nevertheless there are a high possibility of decrease in the short term. On the large timeframe scale it can be seen that the price should go back to the critical  support level  around $5900. There will be more thorough analysis of short term timeframe chart later. 

Still there is no guarantee of a great and smooth rally. When it consolidates around support line in the short term there will be new wave of growth which can be accompanied by drawbacks or sharp rises.  

We have a very strong rally foundation now the only problem is that the market is still not confident to just buy and FOMO again. Trust has been destroyed during two last month of market falls. So there is a big chance  BTC -1.51%  will go sideways in the mid term after short term consolidation. 

Conclusion: current  BTC -1.51%  price rise is only upward correction of a downtrend in the short term. The price will move to the mentioned on the chart zone. However according to analysis in the long term the price should move upward after that till Autumn. Moreover in the mid term there is a chance of sideways movement.  

Breaking $10 000 level will be a strong sign of a new wave of growth which will be confirmed after consolidation around $11 360

 BTC -1.51%  will certainly have another leg up towards 7000$ from there I think the selling pressure will force  btc -1.51%  to pullback to 6500, we need to see a daily higher low to form in the 6500 area to have a shift in the downtrend.

A more thorough analysis of the Short term situation is presented on this chart. 

If  BTC -1.51%  manages to break through the resistance of $6500 and consolidate itself higher, then the price will have the opportunity to test the level of $7000. However the more probable opportunity is a slow and small rise after which there will be a decline to the lower edge of  Ichimoku cloud . In case of not overcoming resistance to the support range $6100-6000. The next step will be a reduction to the long term critical support around $5600-5900 up from which there will be a gradual rise which was described in the previous analysis

Make no mistake of taking this rally for a reversal or end of correction.  Bitcoin              will go down to $5,000 and it will break market structure doing that. This is exactly what happened in 2014. There was this whole debate about whether  Bitcoin              is following 2013 or 2014. Some said, 2013, some said 2014. Apparently, both events appeared mutually exclusive, but something more surprising has happened which has made me even more  bullish  on  Bitcoin              long term. In my next analysis on Monday, I will explain how  Bitcoin              is following both 2013 and 2014 at the same time! Stay tuned. Follow for updates.

Yesterday was a good day for  BTC -1.51%  - it seems we have double bottomed and reversed which has left us in a sideways pattern around 6400. 

$6400 has always been mentioned as a major  resistance level .  The current pattern continues to challenge 6400 and hopefully we have the momentum to break through it before we challenge 6800 and 7200. 

In the short term - low  volume  could keep us moving sideways.  This pattern should be the beginning of a few patterns - particularly another  H&S  if the chart forms a head. 

The only trades worth making right now are buys.  We will have to wait until we make it above 6800 before we can determine if we are going to be able to break through 7200 or if we will be pushed down again before making another run. 

If we see a head form - a short opportunity may present itself as a right side is carved out.   For those of you who are looking to long - these are the best prices we have seen in some time.

Make no mistake of taking this rally for a reversal or end of correction.  Bitcoin -1.38%  will go down to $5,000 and it will break market structure doing that. This is exactly what happened in 2014. There was this whole debate about whether  Bitcoin -1.38%  is following 2013 or 2014. Some said, 2013, some said 2014. Apparently, both events appeared mutually exclusive, but something more surprising has happened which has made me even more  bullish  on  Bitcoin -1.38%  long term.

Yesterday was a good day for  BTC -1.38%  - it seems we have double bottomed and reversed which has left us in a sideways pattern around 6400. 

$6400 has always been mentioned as a major  resistance level .  The current pattern continues to challenge 6400 and hopefully we have the momentum to break through it before we challenge 6800 and 7200. 

In the short term - low  volume  could keep us moving sideways.  This pattern should be the beginning of a few patterns - particularly another  H&S  if the chart forms a head. 

The only trades worth making right now are buys.  We will have to wait until we make it above 6800 before we can determine if we are going to be able to break through 7200 or if we will be pushed down again before making another run. 

If we see a head form - a short opportunity may present itself as a right side is carved out.   For those of you who are looking to long - these are the best prices we have seen in some time.

It has been a long weekend for me as I'm continuing to move house. Just whilst I have a moment I'd like to update everybody on what  Bitcoin -1.38%  is doing and how to trade it professionally! 

Another follow up analysis of Bitcoin! Price has moved strongly to the upside since I predicted an up move at support at 5790, so the analysis is running perfectly. Price has now stopped a side-wards  resistance level  at 6400. (See related ideas for more information regarding this analysis) Now, price looks like it's had a minor rounded top that started on 30th June and has continued since.  

There is a short term horizontal  support zone  between 6280 and 6180, which also coincides with the 20 and 50 moving average converged support. This is the logical place to first look for price to correct to, before buying to the upside. Also, if price goes into the horizontal  support zone  as I'm predicting then price will also hit  Fibonacci retracement  support, meaning there will be a compelling launch pad for price to go to the upside. 

When price hits the  support zone  watch for a buy, with a view of holding  Bitcoin -1.38%  until the next  structure resistance , which is the only real logical level to hold, at 6820 to 6925.  

Bear in mind if price doesn't go below 6320, then it might not even correct at the horizontal  support zone  mentioned for the up move. So you need to keep a sharp eye on price action at around this level. 

I will update this analysis throughout if it receives sufficient attention.

I've marked off some nice  supply and demand  levels on the 2H-TF, my take is that  BTC -1.38%  will be consolidating between a roughly $1000 trading range. After last week bull run  BTC -1.38%  is now making a bullflag and it's held up by demand D1. My take is that  BTC -1.38%  wants to move further up to test supply S1, the only question is how far will  BTC -1.38%  retrace before moving further up, that is do we get a pullback to demand D1 or to D2. Either way I will be looking for a buy entry on the lower timeframes

On the 1-day timeframe chart long term  BTC -1.38%  analysis suggests that  BTC -1.38%  finally gains strength. There should be a new rally soon, it wont we similar to the previous where  BTC -1.38%  was pumped however it will be a gradual rise within months till the middle of the Autumn. It doesn't look like this time  BTC -1.38%  will fail again. There are a much more solid technical and fundamental foundation this time.  

Ichi cloud lines intersection and XABCD pattern with repeated BB contraction suggest that there should be trend reverse. This is confirmed by regular  bullish divergence  and price movement in the median channel. 

Nevertheless there are a high possibility of decrease in the short term. On the large timeframe scale it can be seen that the price should go back to the critical  support level  around $5900. There will be more thorough analysis of short term timeframe chart later. 

Still there is no guarantee of a great and smooth rally. When it consolidates around support line in the short term there will be new wave of growth which can be accompanied by drawbacks or sharp rises.  

We have a very strong rally foundation now the only problem is that the market is still not confident to just buy and FOMO again. Trust has been destroyed during two last month of market falls. So there is a big chance  BTC -1.38%  will go sideways in the mid term after short term consolidation. 

Conclusion: current  BTC -1.38%  price rise is only upward correction of a downtrend in the short term. The price will move to the mentioned on the chart zone. However according to analysis in the long term the price should move upward after that till Autumn. Moreover in the mid term there is a chance of sideways movement.  

Breaking $10 000 level will be a strong sign of a new wave of growth which will be confirmed after consolidation around $11 360

 BTC -1.38%  will certainly have another leg up towards 7000$ from there I think the selling pressure will force  btc -1.38%  to pullback to 6500, we need to see a daily higher low to form in the 6500 area to have a shift in the downtrend.

A more thorough analysis of the Short term situation is presented on this chart. 

If  BTC -1.39%  manages to break through the resistance of $6500 and consolidate itself higher, then the price will have the opportunity to test the level of $7000. However the more probable opportunity is a slow and small rise after which there will be a decline to the lower edge of  Ichimoku cloud . In case of not overcoming resistance to the support range $6100-6000. The next step will be a reduction to the long term critical support around $5600-5900 up from which there will be a gradual rise which was described in the previous analysis

 BTC -1.40%  will certainly have another leg up towards 7000$ from there I think the selling pressure will force  btc -1.40%  to pullback to 6500, we need to see a daily higher low to form in the 6500 area to have a shift in the downtrend.

A more thorough analysis of the Short term situation is presented on this chart. 

If  BTC -1.40%  manages to break through the resistance of $6500 and consolidate itself higher, then the price will have the opportunity to test the level of $7000. However the more probable opportunity is a slow and small rise after which there will be a decline to the lower edge of  Ichimoku cloud . In case of not overcoming resistance to the support range $6100-6000. The next step will be a reduction to the long term critical support around $5600-5900 up from which there will be a gradual rise which was described in the previous analysis

Make no mistake of taking this rally for a reversal or end of correction.  Bitcoin -1.40%  will go down to $5,000 and it will break market structure doing that. This is exactly what happened in 2014. There was this whole debate about whether  Bitcoin -1.40%  is following 2013 or 2014. Some said, 2013, some said 2014. Apparently, both events appeared mutually exclusive, but something more surprising has happened which has made me even more  bullish  on  Bitcoin -1.40%  long term. In my next analysis on Monday, I will explain how  Bitcoin -1.40%  is following both 2013 and 2014 at the same time! Stay tuned. Follow for updates.

Yesterday was a good day for  BTC -1.40%  - it seems we have double bottomed and reversed which has left us in a sideways pattern around 6400. 

$6400 has always been mentioned as a major  resistance level .  The current pattern continues to challenge 6400 and hopefully we have the momentum to break through it before we challenge 6800 and 7200. 

In the short term - low  volume  could keep us moving sideways.  This pattern should be the beginning of a few patterns - particularly another  H&S  if the chart forms a head. 

The only trades worth making right now are buys.  We will have to wait until we make it above 6800 before we can determine if we are going to be able to break through 7200 or if we will be pushed down again before making another run. 

If we see a head form - a short opportunity may present itself as a right side is carved out.   For those of you who are looking to long - these are the best prices we have seen in some time.

It has been a long weekend for me as I'm continuing to move house. Just whilst I have a moment I'd like to update everybody on what  Bitcoin -1.40%  is doing and how to trade it professionally! 

Another follow up analysis of Bitcoin! Price has moved strongly to the upside since I predicted an up move at support at 5790, so the analysis is running perfectly. Price has now stopped a side-wards  resistance level  at 6400. (See related ideas for more information regarding this analysis) Now, price looks like it's had a minor rounded top that started on 30th June and has continued since.  

There is a short term horizontal  support zone  between 6280 and 6180, which also coincides with the 20 and 50 moving average converged support. This is the logical place to first look for price to correct to, before buying to the upside. Also, if price goes into the horizontal  support zone  as I'm predicting then price will also hit  Fibonacci retracement  support, meaning there will be a compelling launch pad for price to go to the upside. 

When price hits the  support zone  watch for a buy, with a view of holding  Bitcoin -1.40%  until the next  structure resistance , which is the only real logical level to hold, at 6820 to 6925.  

Bear in mind if price doesn't go below 6320, then it might not even correct at the horizontal  support zone  mentioned for the up move. So you need to keep a sharp eye on price action at around this level. 

I will update this analysis throughout if it receives sufficient attention.

I've marked off some nice  supply and demand  levels on the 2H-TF, my take is that  BTC -1.43%  will be consolidating between a roughly $1000 trading range. After last week bull run  BTC -1.43%  is now making a bullflag and it's held up by demand D1. My take is that  BTC -1.43%  wants to move further up to test supply S1, the only question is how far will  BTC -1.43%  retrace before moving further up, that is do we get a pullback to demand D1 or to D2. Either way I will be looking for a buy entry on the lower timeframes

1530449953.0,SkyRockSignals,BTCUSD Long term scenario,"
On the 1-day timeframe chart long term  BTC -1.43%  analysis suggests that  BTC -1.43%  finally gains strength. There should be a new rally soon, it wont we similar to the previous where  BTC -1.43%  was pumped however it will be a gradual rise within months till the middle of the Autumn. It doesn't look like this time  BTC -1.43%  will fail again. There are a much more solid technical and fundamental foundation this time.  

Ichi cloud lines intersection and XABCD pattern with repeated BB contraction suggest that there should be trend reverse. This is confirmed by regular  bullish divergence  and price movement in the median channel. 

Nevertheless there are a high possibility of decrease in the short term. On the large timeframe scale it can be seen that the price should go back to the critical  support level  around $5900. There will be more thorough analysis of short term timeframe chart later. 

Still there is no guarantee of a great and smooth rally. When it consolidates around support line in the short term there will be new wave of growth which can be accompanied by drawbacks or sharp rises.  

We have a very strong rally foundation now the only problem is that the market is still not confident to just buy and FOMO again. Trust has been destroyed during two last month of market falls. So there is a big chance  BTC -1.43%  will go sideways in the mid term after short term consolidation. 

Conclusion: current  BTC -1.43%  price rise is only upward correction of a downtrend in the short term. The price will move to the mentioned on the chart zone. However according to analysis in the long term the price should move upward after that till Autumn. Moreover in the mid term there is a chance of sideways movement.  

Breaking $10 000 level will be a strong sign of a new wave of growth which will be confirmed after consolidation around $11 360

I've marked off some nice  supply and demand  levels on the 2H-TF, my take is that  BTC -1.44%  will be consolidating between a roughly $1000 trading range. After last week bull run  BTC -1.44%  is now making a bullflag and it's held up by demand D1. My take is that  BTC -1.44%  wants to move further up to test supply S1, the only question is how far will  BTC -1.44%  retrace before moving further up, that is do we get a pullback to demand D1 or to D2. Either way I will be looking for a buy entry on the lower timeframes

On the 1-day timeframe chart long term  BTC -1.44%  analysis suggests that  BTC -1.44%  finally gains strength. There should be a new rally soon, it wont we similar to the previous where  BTC -1.44%  was pumped however it will be a gradual rise within months till the middle of the Autumn. It doesn't look like this time  BTC -1.44%  will fail again. There are a much more solid technical and fundamental foundation this time.  

Ichi cloud lines intersection and XABCD pattern with repeated BB contraction suggest that there should be trend reverse. This is confirmed by regular  bullish divergence  and price movement in the median channel. 

Nevertheless there are a high possibility of decrease in the short term. On the large timeframe scale it can be seen that the price should go back to the critical  support level  around $5900. There will be more thorough analysis of short term timeframe chart later. 

Still there is no guarantee of a great and smooth rally. When it consolidates around support line in the short term there will be new wave of growth which can be accompanied by drawbacks or sharp rises.  

We have a very strong rally foundation now the only problem is that the market is still not confident to just buy and FOMO again. Trust has been destroyed during two last month of market falls. So there is a big chance  BTC -1.44%  will go sideways in the mid term after short term consolidation. 

Conclusion: current  BTC -1.44%  price rise is only upward correction of a downtrend in the short term. The price will move to the mentioned on the chart zone. However according to analysis in the long term the price should move upward after that till Autumn. Moreover in the mid term there is a chance of sideways movement.  

Breaking $10 000 level will be a strong sign of a new wave of growth which will be confirmed after consolidation around $11 360

 BTC -1.44%  will certainly have another leg up towards 7000$ from there I think the selling pressure will force  btc -1.44%  to pullback to 6500, we need to see a daily higher low to form in the 6500 area to have a shift in the downtrend.

A more thorough analysis of the Short term situation is presented on this chart. 

If  BTC -1.44%  manages to break through the resistance of $6500 and consolidate itself higher, then the price will have the opportunity to test the level of $7000. However the more probable opportunity is a slow and small rise after which there will be a decline to the lower edge of  Ichimoku cloud . In case of not overcoming resistance to the support range $6100-6000. The next step will be a reduction to the long term critical support around $5600-5900 up from which there will be a gradual rise which was described in the previous analysis

Make no mistake of taking this rally for a reversal or end of correction.  Bitcoin -1.43%  will go down to $5,000 and it will break market structure doing that. This is exactly what happened in 2014. There was this whole debate about whether  Bitcoin -1.43%  is following 2013 or 2014. Some said, 2013, some said 2014. Apparently, both events appeared mutually exclusive, but something more surprising has happened which has made me even more  bullish  on  Bitcoin -1.43%  long term. In my next analysis on Monday, I will explain how  Bitcoin -1.43%  is following both 2013 and 2014 at the same time! Stay tuned. Follow for updates.

Yesterday was a good day for  BTC -1.43%  - it seems we have double bottomed and reversed which has left us in a sideways pattern around 6400. 

$6400 has always been mentioned as a major  resistance level .  The current pattern continues to challenge 6400 and hopefully we have the momentum to break through it before we challenge 6800 and 7200. 

In the short term - low  volume  could keep us moving sideways.  This pattern should be the beginning of a few patterns - particularly another  H&S  if the chart forms a head. 

The only trades worth making right now are buys.  We will have to wait until we make it above 6800 before we can determine if we are going to be able to break through 7200 or if we will be pushed down again before making another run. 

If we see a head form - a short opportunity may present itself as a right side is carved out.   For those of you who are looking to long - these are the best prices we have seen in some time.

It has been a long weekend for me as I'm continuing to move house. Just whilst I have a moment I'd like to update everybody on what  Bitcoin -1.43%  is doing and how to trade it professionally! 

Another follow up analysis of Bitcoin! Price has moved strongly to the upside since I predicted an up move at support at 5790, so the analysis is running perfectly. Price has now stopped a side-wards  resistance level  at 6400. (See related ideas for more information regarding this analysis) Now, price looks like it's had a minor rounded top that started on 30th June and has continued since.  

There is a short term horizontal  support zone  between 6280 and 6180, which also coincides with the 20 and 50 moving average converged support. This is the logical place to first look for price to correct to, before buying to the upside. Also, if price goes into the horizontal  support zone  as I'm predicting then price will also hit  Fibonacci retracement  support, meaning there will be a compelling launch pad for price to go to the upside. 

When price hits the  support zone  watch for a buy, with a view of holding  Bitcoin -1.43%  until the next  structure resistance , which is the only real logical level to hold, at 6820 to 6925.  

Bear in mind if price doesn't go below 6320, then it might not even correct at the horizontal  support zone  mentioned for the up move. So you need to keep a sharp eye on price action at around this level. 

I will update this analysis throughout if it receives sufficient attention.

Yesterday was a good day for  BTC -1.44%  - it seems we have double bottomed and reversed which has left us in a sideways pattern around 6400. 

$6400 has always been mentioned as a major  resistance level .  The current pattern continues to challenge 6400 and hopefully we have the momentum to break through it before we challenge 6800 and 7200. 

In the short term - low  volume  could keep us moving sideways.  This pattern should be the beginning of a few patterns - particularly another  H&S  if the chart forms a head. 

The only trades worth making right now are buys.  We will have to wait until we make it above 6800 before we can determine if we are going to be able to break through 7200 or if we will be pushed down again before making another run. 

If we see a head form - a short opportunity may present itself as a right side is carved out.   For those of you who are looking to long - these are the best prices we have seen in some time.

It has been a long weekend for me as I'm continuing to move house. Just whilst I have a moment I'd like to update everybody on what  Bitcoin              is doing and how to trade it professionally! 

Another follow up analysis of Bitcoin! Price has moved strongly to the upside since I predicted an up move at support at 5790, so the analysis is running perfectly. Price has now stopped a side-wards  resistance level  at 6400. (See related ideas for more information regarding this analysis) Now, price looks like it's had a minor rounded top that started on 30th June and has continued since.  

There is a short term horizontal  support zone  between 6280 and 6180, which also coincides with the 20 and 50 moving average converged support. This is the logical place to first look for price to correct to, before buying to the upside. Also, if price goes into the horizontal  support zone  as I'm predicting then price will also hit  Fibonacci retracement  support, meaning there will be a compelling launch pad for price to go to the upside. 

When price hits the  support zone  watch for a buy, with a view of holding  Bitcoin              until the next  structure resistance , which is the only real logical level to hold, at 6820 to 6925.  

Bear in mind if price doesn't go below 6320, then it might not even correct at the horizontal  support zone  mentioned for the up move. So you need to keep a sharp eye on price action at around this level. 

I will update this analysis throughout if it receives sufficient attention.

I've marked off some nice  supply and demand  levels on the 2H-TF, my take is that  BTC              will be consolidating between a roughly $1000 trading range. After last week bull run  BTC              is now making a bullflag and it's held up by demand D1. My take is that  BTC              wants to move further up to test supply S1, the only question is how far will  BTC              retrace before moving further up, that is do we get a pullback to demand D1 or to D2. Either way I will be looking for a buy entry on the lower timeframes

On the 1-day timeframe chart long term  BTC              analysis suggests that  BTC              finally gains strength. There should be a new rally soon, it wont we similar to the previous where  BTC              was pumped however it will be a gradual rise within months till the middle of the Autumn. It doesn't look like this time  BTC              will fail again. There are a much more solid technical and fundamental foundation this time.  

Ichi cloud lines intersection and XABCD pattern with repeated BB contraction suggest that there should be trend reverse. This is confirmed by regular  bullish divergence  and price movement in the median channel. 

Nevertheless there are a high possibility of decrease in the short term. On the large timeframe scale it can be seen that the price should go back to the critical  support level  around $5900. There will be more thorough analysis of short term timeframe chart later. 

Still there is no guarantee of a great and smooth rally. When it consolidates around support line in the short term there will be new wave of growth which can be accompanied by drawbacks or sharp rises.  

We have a very strong rally foundation now the only problem is that the market is still not confident to just buy and FOMO again. Trust has been destroyed during two last month of market falls. So there is a big chance  BTC              will go sideways in the mid term after short term consolidation. 

Conclusion: current  BTC              price rise is only upward correction of a downtrend in the short term. The price will move to the mentioned on the chart zone. However according to analysis in the long term the price should move upward after that till Autumn. Moreover in the mid term there is a chance of sideways movement.  

Breaking $10 000 level will be a strong sign of a new wave of growth which will be confirmed after consolidation around $11 360

 BTC -1.44%  will certainly have another leg up towards 7000$ from there I think the selling pressure will force  btc -1.44%  to pullback to 6500, we need to see a daily higher low to form in the 6500 area to have a shift in the downtrend.

A more thorough analysis of the Short term situation is presented on this chart. 

If  BTC              manages to break through the resistance of $6500 and consolidate itself higher, then the price will have the opportunity to test the level of $7000. However the more probable opportunity is a slow and small rise after which there will be a decline to the lower edge of  Ichimoku cloud . In case of not overcoming resistance to the support range $6100-6000. The next step will be a reduction to the long term critical support around $5600-5900 up from which there will be a gradual rise which was described in the previous analysis

Make no mistake of taking this rally for a reversal or end of correction.  Bitcoin              will go down to $5,000 and it will break market structure doing that. This is exactly what happened in 2014. There was this whole debate about whether  Bitcoin              is following 2013 or 2014. Some said, 2013, some said 2014. Apparently, both events appeared mutually exclusive, but something more surprising has happened which has made me even more  bullish  on  Bitcoin              long term. In my next analysis on Monday, I will explain how  Bitcoin              is following both 2013 and 2014 at the same time! Stay tuned. Follow for updates.

If  BTC              manages to break through the resistance of $6500 and consolidate itself higher, then the price will have the opportunity to test the level of $7000. However the more probable opportunity is a slow and small rise after which there will be a decline to the lower edge of  Ichimoku cloud . In case of not overcoming resistance to the support range $6100-6000. The next step will be a reduction to the long term critical support around $5600-5900 up from which there will be a gradual rise which was described in the previous analysis

Make no mistake of taking this rally for a reversal or end of correction.  Bitcoin -1.48%  will go down to $5,000 and it will break market structure doing that. This is exactly what happened in 2014. There was this whole debate about whether  Bitcoin -1.48%  is following 2013 or 2014. Some said, 2013, some said 2014. Apparently, both events appeared mutually exclusive, but something more surprising has happened which has made me even more  bullish  on  Bitcoin -1.48%  long term. In my next analysis on Monday, I will explain how  Bitcoin -1.48%  is following both 2013 and 2014 at the same time! Stay tuned. Follow for updates.

Yesterday was a good day for  BTC -1.48%  - it seems we have double bottomed and reversed which has left us in a sideways pattern around 6400. 

$6400 has always been mentioned as a major  resistance level .  The current pattern continues to challenge 6400 and hopefully we have the momentum to break through it before we challenge 6800 and 7200. 

In the short term - low  volume  could keep us moving sideways.  This pattern should be the beginning of a few patterns - particularly another  H&S  if the chart forms a head. 

The only trades worth making right now are buys.  We will have to wait until we make it above 6800 before we can determine if we are going to be able to break through 7200 or if we will be pushed down again before making another run. 

If we see a head form - a short opportunity may present itself as a right side is carved out.   For those of you who are looking to long - these are the best prices we have seen in some time.

It has been a long weekend for me as I'm continuing to move house. Just whilst I have a moment I'd like to update everybody on what  Bitcoin -1.48%  is doing and how to trade it professionally! 

Another follow up analysis of Bitcoin! Price has moved strongly to the upside since I predicted an up move at support at 5790, so the analysis is running perfectly. Price has now stopped a side-wards  resistance level  at 6400. (See related ideas for more information regarding this analysis) Now, price looks like it's had a minor rounded top that started on 30th June and has continued since.  

There is a short term horizontal  support zone  between 6280 and 6180, which also coincides with the 20 and 50 moving average converged support. This is the logical place to first look for price to correct to, before buying to the upside. Also, if price goes into the horizontal  support zone  as I'm predicting then price will also hit  Fibonacci retracement  support, meaning there will be a compelling launch pad for price to go to the upside. 

When price hits the  support zone  watch for a buy, with a view of holding  Bitcoin -1.48%  until the next  structure resistance , which is the only real logical level to hold, at 6820 to 6925.  

Bear in mind if price doesn't go below 6320, then it might not even correct at the horizontal  support zone  mentioned for the up move. So you need to keep a sharp eye on price action at around this level. 

I will update this analysis throughout if it receives sufficient attention.

I've marked off some nice  supply and demand  levels on the 2H-TF, my take is that  BTC -1.48%  will be consolidating between a roughly $1000 trading range. After last week bull run  BTC -1.48%  is now making a bullflag and it's held up by demand D1. My take is that  BTC -1.48%  wants to move further up to test supply S1, the only question is how far will  BTC -1.48%  retrace before moving further up, that is do we get a pullback to demand D1 or to D2. Either way I will be looking for a buy entry on the lower timeframes

1530449953.0,SkyRockSignals,BTCUSD Long term scenario,"
On the 1-day timeframe chart long term  BTC -1.48%  analysis suggests that  BTC -1.48%  finally gains strength. There should be a new rally soon, it wont we similar to the previous where  BTC -1.48%  was pumped however it will be a gradual rise within months till the middle of the Autumn. It doesn't look like this time  BTC -1.48%  will fail again. There are a much more solid technical and fundamental foundation this time.  

Ichi cloud lines intersection and XABCD pattern with repeated BB contraction suggest that there should be trend reverse. This is confirmed by regular  bullish divergence  and price movement in the median channel. 

Nevertheless there are a high possibility of decrease in the short term. On the large timeframe scale it can be seen that the price should go back to the critical  support level  around $5900. There will be more thorough analysis of short term timeframe chart later. 

Still there is no guarantee of a great and smooth rally. When it consolidates around support line in the short term there will be new wave of growth which can be accompanied by drawbacks or sharp rises.  

We have a very strong rally foundation now the only problem is that the market is still not confident to just buy and FOMO again. Trust has been destroyed during two last month of market falls. So there is a big chance  BTC -1.48%  will go sideways in the mid term after short term consolidation. 

Conclusion: current  BTC -1.48%  price rise is only upward correction of a downtrend in the short term. The price will move to the mentioned on the chart zone. However according to analysis in the long term the price should move upward after that till Autumn. Moreover in the mid term there is a chance of sideways movement.  

Breaking $10 000 level will be a strong sign of a new wave of growth which will be confirmed after consolidation around $11 360

 BTC -1.48%  will certainly have another leg up towards 7000$ from there I think the selling pressure will force  btc -1.48%  to pullback to 6500, we need to see a daily higher low to form in the 6500 area to have a shift in the downtrend.

Nevertheless there are a high possibility of decrease in the short term. On the large timeframe scale it can be seen that the price should go back to the critical  support level  around $5900. There will be more thorough analysis of short term timeframe chart later. 

Still there is no guarantee of a great and smooth rally. When it consolidates around support line in the short term there will be new wave of growth which can be accompanied by drawbacks or sharp rises.  

We have a very strong rally foundation now the only problem is that the market is still not confident to just buy and FOMO again. Trust has been destroyed during two last month of market falls. So there is a big chance  BTC -1.48%  will go sideways in the mid term after short term consolidation. 

Conclusion: current  BTC -1.48%  price rise is only upward correction of a downtrend in the short term. The price will move to the mentioned on the chart zone. However according to analysis in the long term the price should move upward after that till Autumn. Moreover in the mid term there is a chance of sideways movement.  

Breaking $10 000 level will be a strong sign of a new wave of growth which will be confirmed after consolidation around $11 360

 BTC -1.48%  will certainly have another leg up towards 7000$ from there I think the selling pressure will force  btc -1.48%  to pullback to 6500, we need to see a daily higher low to form in the 6500 area to have a shift in the downtrend.

A more thorough analysis of the Short term situation is presented on this chart. 

If  BTC              manages to break through the resistance of $6500 and consolidate itself higher, then the price will have the opportunity to test the level of $7000. However the more probable opportunity is a slow and small rise after which there will be a decline to the lower edge of  Ichimoku cloud . In case of not overcoming resistance to the support range $6100-6000. The next step will be a reduction to the long term critical support around $5600-5900 up from which there will be a gradual rise which was described in the previous analysis

Make no mistake of taking this rally for a reversal or end of correction.  Bitcoin              will go down to $5,000 and it will break market structure doing that. This is exactly what happened in 2014. There was this whole debate about whether  Bitcoin              is following 2013 or 2014. Some said, 2013, some said 2014.

Yesterday was a good day for  BTC -1.48%  - it seems we have double bottomed and reversed which has left us in a sideways pattern around 6400. 

$6400 has always been mentioned as a major  resistance level .  The current pattern continues to challenge 6400 and hopefully we have the momentum to break through it before we challenge 6800 and 7200. 

In the short term - low  volume  could keep us moving sideways.  This pattern should be the beginning of a few patterns - particularly another  H&S  if the chart forms a head. 

The only trades worth making right now are buys.  We will have to wait until we make it above 6800 before we can determine if we are going to be able to break through 7200 or if we will be pushed down again before making another run. 

If we see a head form - a short opportunity may present itself as a right side is carved out.   For those of you who are looking to long - these are the best prices we have seen in some time.

It has been a long weekend for me as I'm continuing to move house. Just whilst I have a moment I'd like to update everybody on what  Bitcoin              is doing and how to trade it professionally! 

Another follow up analysis of Bitcoin! Price has moved strongly to the upside since I predicted an up move at support at 5790, so the analysis is running perfectly. Price has now stopped a side-wards  resistance level  at 6400. (See related ideas for more information regarding this analysis) Now, price looks like it's had a minor rounded top that started on 30th June and has continued since.  

There is a short term horizontal  support zone  between 6280 and 6180, which also coincides with the 20 and 50 moving average converged support. This is the logical place to first look for price to correct to, before buying to the upside. Also, if price goes into the horizontal  support zone  as I'm predicting then price will also hit  Fibonacci retracement  support, meaning there will be a compelling launch pad for price to go to the upside. 

When price hits the  support zone  watch for a buy, with a view of holding  Bitcoin              until the next  structure resistance , which is the only real logical level to hold, at 6820 to 6925.  

Bear in mind if price doesn't go below 6320, then it might not even correct at the horizontal  support zone  mentioned for the up move. So you need to keep a sharp eye on price action at around this level. 

I will update this analysis throughout if it receives sufficient attention.

I've marked off some nice  supply and demand  levels on the 2H-TF, my take is that  BTC              will be consolidating between a roughly $1000 trading range. After last week bull run  BTC              is now making a bullflag and it's held up by demand D1. My take is that  BTC              wants to move further up to test supply S1, the only question is how far will  BTC              retrace before moving further up, that is do we get a pullback to demand D1 or to D2. Either way I will be looking for a buy entry on the lower timeframes

It has been a long weekend for me as I'm continuing to move house. Just whilst I have a moment I'd like to update everybody on what  Bitcoin              is doing and how to trade it professionally! 

Another follow up analysis of Bitcoin! Price has moved strongly to the upside since I predicted an up move at support at 5790, so the analysis is running perfectly. Price has now stopped a side-wards  resistance level  at 6400. (See related ideas for more information regarding this analysis) Now, price looks like it's had a minor rounded top that started on 30th June and has continued since.  

There is a short term horizontal  support zone  between 6280 and 6180, which also coincides with the 20 and 50 moving average converged support. This is the logical place to first look for price to correct to, before buying to the upside. Also, if price goes into the horizontal  support zone  as I'm predicting then price will also hit  Fibonacci retracement  support, meaning there will be a compelling launch pad for price to go to the upside. 

When price hits the  support zone  watch for a buy, with a view of holding  Bitcoin              until the next  structure resistance , which is the only real logical level to hold, at 6820 to 6925.  

Bear in mind if price doesn't go below 6320, then it might not even correct at the horizontal  support zone  mentioned for the up move. So you need to keep a sharp eye on price action at around this level. 

I will update this analysis throughout if it receives sufficient attention.

I've marked off some nice  supply and demand  levels on the 2H-TF, my take is that  BTC              will be consolidating between a roughly $1000 trading range. After last week bull run  BTC              is now making a bullflag and it's held up by demand D1. My take is that  BTC              wants to move further up to test supply S1, the only question is how far will  BTC              retrace before moving further up, that is do we get a pullback to demand D1 or to D2. Either way I will be looking for a buy entry on the lower timeframes

On the 1-day timeframe chart long term  BTC -1.49%  analysis suggests that  BTC -1.49%  finally gains strength. There should be a new rally soon, it wont we similar to the previous where  BTC -1.49%  was pumped however it will be a gradual rise within months till the middle of the Autumn. It doesn't look like this time  BTC -1.49%  will fail again. There are a much more solid technical and fundamental foundation this time.  

Ichi cloud lines intersection and XABCD pattern with repeated BB contraction suggest that there should be trend reverse. This is confirmed by regular  bullish divergence  and price movement in the median channel. 

Nevertheless there are a high possibility of decrease in the short term. On the large timeframe scale it can be seen that the price should go back to the critical  support level  around $5900. There will be more thorough analysis of short term timeframe chart later. 

Still there is no guarantee of a great and smooth rally. When it consolidates around support line in the short term there will be new wave of growth which can be accompanied by drawbacks or sharp rises.  

We have a very strong rally foundation now the only problem is that the market is still not confident to just buy and FOMO again. Trust has been destroyed during two last month of market falls. So there is a big chance  BTC -1.49%  will go sideways in the mid term after short term consolidation. 

Conclusion: current  BTC -1.49%  price rise is only upward correction of a downtrend in the short term. The price will move to the mentioned on the chart zone. However according to analysis in the long term the price should move upward after that till Autumn. Moreover in the mid term there is a chance of sideways movement.  

Breaking $10 000 level will be a strong sign of a new wave of growth which will be confirmed after consolidation around $11 360

 BTC -1.49%  will certainly have another leg up towards 7000$ from there I think the selling pressure will force  btc -1.49%  to pullback to 6500, we need to see a daily higher low to form in the 6500 area to have a shift in the downtrend.

A more thorough analysis of the Short term situation is presented on this chart. 

If  BTC -1.49%  manages to break through the resistance of $6500 and consolidate itself higher, then the price will have the opportunity to test the level of $7000. However the more probable opportunity is a slow and small rise after which there will be a decline to the lower edge of  Ichimoku cloud . In case of not overcoming resistance to the support range $6100-6000. The next step will be a reduction to the long term critical support around $5600-5900 up from which there will be a gradual rise which was described in the previous analysis

Make no mistake of taking this rally for a reversal or end of correction.  Bitcoin -1.59%  will go down to $5,000 and it will break market structure doing that. This is exactly what happened in 2014. There was this whole debate about whether  Bitcoin -1.59%  is following 2013 or 2014. Some said, 2013, some said 2014. Apparently, both events appeared mutually exclusive, but something more surprising has happened which has made me even more  bullish  on  Bitcoin -1.59%  long term. In my next analysis on Monday, I will explain how  Bitcoin -1.59%  is following both 2013 and 2014 at the same time! Stay tuned. Follow for updates.

Yesterday was a good day for  BTC -1.59%  - it seems we have double bottomed and reversed which has left us in a sideways pattern around 6400. 

$6400 has always been mentioned as a major  resistance level .  The current pattern continues to challenge 6400 and hopefully we have the momentum to break through it before we challenge 6800 and 7200. 

In the short term - low  volume  could keep us moving sideways.  This pattern should be the beginning of a few patterns - particularly another  H&S  if the chart forms a head. 

The only trades worth making right now are buys.  We will have to wait until we make it above 6800 before we can determine if we are going to be able to break through 7200 or if we will be pushed down again before making another run. 

If we see a head form - a short opportunity may present itself as a right side is carved out.   For those of you who are looking to long - these are the best prices we have seen in some time.

If  BTC              manages to break through the resistance of $6500 and consolidate itself higher, then the price will have the opportunity to test the level of $7000. However the more probable opportunity is a slow and small rise after which there will be a decline to the lower edge of  Ichimoku cloud . In case of not overcoming resistance to the support range $6100-6000. The next step will be a reduction to the long term critical support around $5600-5900 up from which there will be a gradual rise which was described in the previous analysis

Make no mistake of taking this rally for a reversal or end of correction.  Bitcoin              will go down to $5,000 and it will break market structure doing that. This is exactly what happened in 2014. There was this whole debate about whether  Bitcoin              is following 2013 or 2014. Some said, 2013, some said 2014. Apparently, both events appeared mutually exclusive, but something more surprising has happened which has made me even more  bullish  on  Bitcoin              long term. In my next analysis on Monday, I will explain how  Bitcoin              is following both 2013 and 2014 at the same time! Stay tuned. Follow for updates.

Yesterday was a good day for  BTC -1.59%  - it seems we have double bottomed and reversed which has left us in a sideways pattern around 6400. 

$6400 has always been mentioned as a major  resistance level .  The current pattern continues to challenge 6400 and hopefully we have the momentum to break through it before we challenge 6800 and 7200. 

In the short term - low  volume  could keep us moving sideways.  This pattern should be the beginning of a few patterns - particularly another  H&S  if the chart forms a head. 

The only trades worth making right now are buys.  We will have to wait until we make it above 6800 before we can determine if we are going to be able to break through 7200 or if we will be pushed down again before making another run. 

If we see a head form - a short opportunity may present itself as a right side is carved out.   For those of you who are looking to long - these are the best prices we have seen in some time.

It has been a long weekend for me as I'm continuing to move house. Just whilst I have a moment I'd like to update everybody on what  Bitcoin              is doing and how to trade it professionally! 

Another follow up analysis of Bitcoin! Price has moved strongly to the upside since I predicted an up move at support at 5790, so the analysis is running perfectly. Price has now stopped a side-wards  resistance level  at 6400. (See related ideas for more information regarding this analysis) Now, price looks like it's had a minor rounded top that started on 30th June and has continued since.  

There is a short term horizontal  support zone  between 6280 and 6180, which also coincides with the 20 and 50 moving average converged support. This is the logical place to first look for price to correct to, before buying to the upside. Also, if price goes into the horizontal  support zone  as I'm predicting then price will also hit  Fibonacci retracement  support, meaning there will be a compelling launch pad for price to go to the upside. 

When price hits the  support zone  watch for a buy, with a view of holding  Bitcoin              until the next  structure resistance , which is the only real logical level to hold, at 6820 to 6925.  

Bear in mind if price doesn't go below 6320, then it might not even correct at the horizontal  support zone  mentioned for the up move. So you need to keep a sharp eye on price action at around this level. 

I will update this analysis throughout if it receives sufficient attention.

I've marked off some nice  supply and demand  levels on the 2H-TF, my take is that  BTC -1.59%  will be consolidating between a roughly $1000 trading range. After last week bull run  BTC -1.59%  is now making a bullflag and it's held up by demand D1. My take is that  BTC -1.59%  wants to move further up to test supply S1, the only question is how far will  BTC -1.59%  retrace before moving further up, that is do we get a pullback to demand D1 or to D2. Either way I will be looking for a buy entry on the lower timeframes

On the 1-day timeframe chart long term  BTC -1.60%  analysis suggests that  BTC -1.60%  finally gains strength. There should be a new rally soon, it wont we similar to the previous where  BTC -1.60%  was pumped however it will be a gradual rise within months till the middle of the Autumn. It doesn't look like this time  BTC -1.60%  will fail again. There are a much more solid technical and fundamental foundation this time.  

Ichi cloud lines intersection and XABCD pattern with repeated BB contraction suggest that there should be trend reverse. This is confirmed by regular  bullish divergence  and price movement in the median channel. 

Nevertheless there are a high possibility of decrease in the short term. On the large timeframe scale it can be seen that the price should go back to the critical  support level  around $5900. There will be more thorough analysis of short term timeframe chart later. 

Still there is no guarantee of a great and smooth rally. When it consolidates around support line in the short term there will be new wave of growth which can be accompanied by drawbacks or sharp rises.  

We have a very strong rally foundation now the only problem is that the market is still not confident to just buy and FOMO again. Trust has been destroyed during two last month of market falls. So there is a big chance  BTC -1.60%  will go sideways in the mid term after short term consolidation. 

Conclusion: current  BTC -1.60%  price rise is only upward correction of a downtrend in the short term. The price will move to the mentioned on the chart zone. However according to analysis in the long term the price should move upward after that till Autumn. Moreover in the mid term there is a chance of sideways movement.  

Breaking $10 000 level will be a strong sign of a new wave of growth which will be confirmed after consolidation around $11 360

 BTC -1.66%  will certainly have another leg up towards 7000$ from there I think the selling pressure will force  btc -1.66%  to pullback to 6500, we need to see a daily higher low to form in the 6500 area to have a shift in the downtrend.

If we compare this price action to 2014, then we should be looking at a retracement to 50% fibo for wave X and then a final wave down to form Z. Wave Z is at 78.6% fibo just like in 2014 and also the bottom of the channel since 2012

The support hold up at 5800 and created a  double bottom . We can now see that previous resistance is looking to hold as support. And we can expect a new move equal to the previous.  

Trade will go:

Stop loss at 6295
