Hello crypto enthusiasts and traders, it has been a while since my last post where the  three drives  pattern failed as LTC was beaten down below the long term  trend line . Still Long on LTC for 2018 as this is not unusual for the crypto market and afterall,  BTC -0.46%  was ranked the worst investment in 2014 and people are starting to say the same thing now about 2018 so let the next part of history also repeat itself - more on that here https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/17/why-bitcoin-is-the-worst-investment-2014 . Anyhow, we've had quite a few weeks to accumulate more LTC and average down at prices many getting into LTC in late 2017 have never experienced. Lets keep it simple with this chart. 

Being curious, I overlayed  Bitcoins -0.46%  % line over Litecoins and have found a pretty cool oscillating pattern between the two. The chart says all you need to know but lets be clear, BTC's line is roughly where LTC would be $110-$130 so this is not saying we are mooning, but more so saying that based on previous history, we SHOULD check in to the  BTC -0.46%  % line. Only if  BTC -0.46%  also rises, would LTC be able have crazy % gains as seen Q4 2017. Happy trading!
