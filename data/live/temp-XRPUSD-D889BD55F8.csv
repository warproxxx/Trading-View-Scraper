I see a lot of posts on Twitter and a lot of new traders making one very big oversight; the relationship of  bitcoin 1.83%  to altcoins is very important. 

It's important to point out the relationship of  bitcoin 1.83%  and altcoins that a lot of new traders overlook. Not all altcoins follow  bitcoin 1.83%  exactly but most do so it is important to do your  technical analysis  and due diligence on  bitcoin 1.83% .  

Saying that, if  bitcoin 1.83%  drops 10% an altcoin may not dip exactly 10%... maybe IOTA drops 8% or Tron drops 5% but rest assured they will more than likely drop to some extent. Here is a good comparison of  bitcoin 1.83%  vs XRP vs IOTA an you will notice that each peak and valley may be slightly different but the trend it follows matches bitocin closely. 

Trade safe, learning  technical analysis , and stay away from pumps and hype you will just lose money. Myself, if i am part of any social media group and I see a lot of FOMO or pumps and hype I generally leave the group.

In my last chart I called the bottom at .43 where I hope some of you were able to pickup some XRP. 

XRP like  BTC 1.83%  seems to have hit its bottom (at least for this cycle) and we should be moving up to test some of the higher resistance areas before we move on. 

XRP double bottomed and reversed which is what has brought us to current prices.  Given the direction  BTC 1.83%  appears to be moving as well as the chart for XRP it looks like we will see .50 before the end of the weekend. 

Is this the bottom before the bull run?   Time will tell.   Once we hit .50 the chart a pattern will have emerged that will give us a clearer idea of where we go next. 

It seems like we are entering a reversal period - but I am waiting  for more than a days trading to confirm that.  XRP is still a bargain relative to where we know its going - its still very much a ""buyers market"" which isn't a terrible thing - we won't be see these low entry points for long.

The rate of Ripple has grown rapidly. 
Priority of the day: the growth of XRPUSD rate to $ 0.50. 
It is too early to talk about the global reversal of Ripple rate, but there are already the first signs of this. Today we are on the side of bulls. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.45 to $ 0.50. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will remain in flat. 
Alternative scenario: 
Do not forget about the  bearish trend  for Ripple, so it may fall to $ 0.41.

XRP still following the  trend line  down towards $0.36, trading below $0.47175 despite the huge crypto pump. Bounces will happen, potentially trapping many traders. 

As I said, anything can happen but I believe we have not seen the bottom yet. 

GOOD LUCK
