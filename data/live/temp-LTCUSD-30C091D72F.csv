So far LTC has found a strong rejection at 50% of the potential 1.618 fib extension of the move from 72.50 to 84.50 (88.27), after rallying to the complete potential target of the bullflag breakout. 

In alignment with the  BTC -0.55%  idea I published earlier today, I think we're going to complete the H&S-ish pattern outlined here in black, and revisit 81-82. A close over 88.5 would scramble this idea. A close over 90 would likely send us to 92, then 93.50 and then 96.  

Measure twice, cut once. 
May all of life's treasures be yours.

This  bearish  resistance looks like it is taking it's toll on poor little litecoin right now.   Head and shoulders  near completion.  If I was into shorting, this would be a good time.  But I just buy bottoms so I'll wait patiently now.

If this correction is not done, this is the road down to the $40 area,I personally dont think its over but time will tell, all the fib extensions measure out perfectly here, the Wave 3 Extension is right on the 161.8%. That tells me we have a wave 5 to finish the 3 to the larger degree(green box) and then 5 (yellow box). But if this is an  ABC , we just have to finish the 5th and will end somewhere in the green box, which should complete the correction for now, either way I think we have at least one more leg down

its a good time to scalp some USD on LTC.  Looks like a  bullish head and shoulders  forming on the pair.
