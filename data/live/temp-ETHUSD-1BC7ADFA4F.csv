1530615992.0,TheChartGuys,ETH Back to EMA 12 Support on the 4 Hour,"
After seeing continuation last night to a higher high, we have seen more significant consolidation to cool off  RSI  levels.  
The notable difference in the previous consolidation is that it was upward sloping and did not cool off  RSI  levels.  
This gives a ""wedge"" patten that often leads to a bear break and pull back.  
Also worth noting the triple top on  BTC -0.45%  which held back the bulls from any significant continuation.  
Now we patiently wait, keep an eye on consolidation  volume , and see if the bulls can hold this 4 hour  EMA  support again, just like the last period of consolidation did before the  bullish  continuation and another leg up.

1530612931.0,bibboyne,Ethereum Potential Trade with 16% Profit - Very Short Term Trade,"
Hello friends!  I have just spotted a potential  VST 1.48%  trade on  Ethereum -1.08%  ( ETHUSD -1.08% ).  Pay no attention to the dates as I don't control the trend so they may vary.  The trade entry and exit prices are as stated in the Forecast indicator.  This trade will be invalidated should price fall below $460. 

Note: I don't encourage  VST 1.48%  or  ST              trades as they offer marginal profit so just take this as a reference. 

Remember my motto: 
The trend may be your friend but the whales are opportunists and more often than not they move against the salient sentiments on TradingView.

Hello Traders, 
ETHUSD -1.09%  has broken out of the  falling wedge  and sitting at D1 20  SMA . We also formed a nice rounding bottom in weekly chart. If we can continue with the uptrend, ETH can see 560$ in near term. Please keep in mind that we will need to retrace a little after the nice price action from the past couple of days. I will be buying some now and reinforce my positions around 450$ 

Entry: 450 
Target 1: 530 
Target 2: 560 
Target 3: 650 (If we manage to pierce through the major resistances and completing the D wave of the symmetrical triangle) 
Stop Loss: 430 

This is not a financial advice. Good Luck

 Ethereum -1.09%  rate has risen sharply in value, as we predicted. 
Priority of the day: the growth of  ETHUSD -1.09%  rate to $ 500. 
The growth of  Ethereum -1.09%  rate is a correction to the downward trend. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD -1.09%  rate will rise from $ 463 to $ 500. 
2. The  ETHUSD -1.09%  rate will remain in the lateral movement until the end of the day. 
An alternative scenario: 
The drop in the  Ethereum -1.09%  rate is predicted from the zone: $ 500- $ 520 to $ 410.

1530595017.0,CryptoComes,ETH/USD New Bullish Wave ,"
 Ethereum -1.08%  follows its allies as the currency pair shows more than four percent growth in the past 24 hours. ETH/USD reached its targets on yesterday and tested the  resistance area  at $473.39.  Ethereum -1.08%  stops there for a while but we think it has still some fuel to develop its growth on Tuesday. 

The currency pair has left the  Flag pattern  on Monday-Tuesday and went upwards according to our expectations.  Ethereum -1.08%  managed to jump off the  support area  at $453.24 and reached the  resistance area  at $473.39. It seems like ETH/USD has already jumped over $473.39. We have drawn another  Flag pattern . 
The main scenario for the nearest future is  bullish . We think that  Ethereum -1.08%  will start to grow from the Flag again and reach the next  resistance area  at $500.36. However, the currency pair may also retest the current  support area  at $473.39 before further growth.
