There are so many amazing traders providing signs in this website or in many others, most of the time they are quite close but sometimes even when everything and everyone thinks  BTC 2.98%  will go up; BOOM suddenly starts to go down.  

The truth is that with barely $300 billion in total market cap in the crypto world, it is really easy  fo              whales to manipulate the prices and not even the best trader can see when the manipulation is coming.  

BTC 2.98%  WILL GO UP FOR SURE, and we want to get in when that happens but at the same time we don't want to lose money guessing when this will happen. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN. So, why not betting for both positions SHORT and LONG at the same time. In this way, you will be IN when  BTC 2.98%  goes to the moon and you will be prepared to not lose your money if the price goes down.  

How? 

Simple! You can open two Bitmex accounts and go for a long position with the 50% of your investment in one of the accounts, and go for a short position with the other 50% in the other account. Set up a close action in the short position when the price drops 10% and if the price goes up, be ready to close the position anytime you want after the prices are more than 10% up. (This is only if you are using 10x leverage)  

The entire strategy is HERE. Don't worry it's an article, no one will sell you anything.

Hello, this will be my first post, let's get into it. 

BTC 2.99%  is finally showing signs of life as it broke out from the  downtrend channel  on July 2.  You can easily see the breakout on the 4hr chart, as the shorter 20 MA has crossed the 50 MA for the first signs of strength in a long time.  The problem is  BTC 2.99%  is facing two huge resistances, the first being where we are at now as I am writing this, about 6750.  If  BTC 2.99%  breaks through that, it would be an excellent medium term buy signal up to around the next res, around 7600-7700.  Further analysis would be needed at that particular point.  I do believe the bottom is behind us, as we double bottomed on 6/24 & 6/29.  Surges of  volume  are finally seen after weeks of exhausted bulls.   ADX  shows positive buy momentum and the beginnings of a steady uptrend.  

Keep an eye out for the breakout above the 6750 res.  Good luck!

Set up a close action in the short position when the price drops 10% and if the price goes up, be ready to close the position anytime you want after the prices are more than 10% up. (This is only if you are using 10x leverage)

Hello, this will be my first post, let's get into it. 

BTC              is finally showing signs of life as it broke out from the  downtrend channel  on July 2.  You can easily see the breakout on the 4hr chart, as the shorter 20 MA has crossed the 50 MA for the first signs of strength in a long time.  The problem is  BTC              is facing two huge resistances, the first being where we are at now as I am writing this, about 6750.  If  BTC              breaks through that, it would be an excellent medium term buy signal up to around the next res, around 7600-7700.  Further analysis would be needed at that particular point.  I do believe the bottom is behind us, as we double bottomed on 6/24 & 6/29.  Surges of  volume  are finally seen after weeks of exhausted bulls.   ADX  shows positive buy momentum and the beginnings of a steady uptrend.  

Keep an eye out for the breakout above the 6750 res.  Good luck!

There are so many amazing traders providing signs in this website or in many others, most of the time they are quite close but sometimes even when everything and everyone thinks  BTC 3.03%  will go up; BOOM suddenly starts to go down.  

The truth is that with barely $300 billion in total market cap in the crypto world, it is really easy  fo 0.00%  whales to manipulate the prices and not even the best trader can see when the manipulation is coming.  

BTC 3.03%  WILL GO UP FOR SURE, and we want to get in when that happens but at the same time we don't want to lose money guessing when this will happen. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN. So, why not betting for both positions SHORT and LONG at the same time. In this way, you will be IN when  BTC 3.03%  goes to the moon and you will be prepared to not lose your money if the price goes down.  

How? 

Simple! You can open two Bitmex accounts and go for a long position with the 50% of your investment in one of the accounts, and go for a short position with the other 50% in the other account.

There are so many amazing traders providing signs in this website or in many others, most of the time they are quite close but sometimes even when everything and everyone thinks  BTC 3.06%  will go up; BOOM suddenly starts to go down.  

The truth is that with barely $300 billion in total market cap in the crypto world, it is really easy  fo              whales to manipulate the prices and not even the best trader can see when the manipulation is coming.  

BTC 3.06%  WILL GO UP FOR SURE, and we want to get in when that happens but at the same time we don't want to lose money guessing when this will happen. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN. So, why not betting for both positions SHORT and LONG at the same time. In this way, you will be IN when  BTC 3.06%  goes to the moon and you will be prepared to not lose your money if the price goes down.  

How? 

Simple! You can open two Bitmex accounts and go for a long position with the 50% of your investment in one of the accounts, and go for a short position with the other 50% in the other account. Set up a close action in the short position when the price drops 10% and if the price goes up, be ready to close the position anytime you want after the prices are more than 10% up. (This is only if you are using 10x leverage)

Hello, this will be my first post, let's get into it. 

BTC 3.06%  is finally showing signs of life as it broke out from the  downtrend channel  on July 2.  You can easily see the breakout on the 4hr chart, as the shorter 20 MA has crossed the 50 MA for the first signs of strength in a long time.  The problem is  BTC 3.06%  is facing two huge resistances, the first being where we are at now as I am writing this, about 6750.  If  BTC 3.06%  breaks through that, it would be an excellent medium term buy signal up to around the next res, around 7600-7700.  Further analysis would be needed at that particular point.  I do believe the bottom is behind us, as we double bottomed on 6/24 & 6/29.  Surges of  volume  are finally seen after weeks of exhausted bulls.   ADX  shows positive buy momentum and the beginnings of a steady uptrend.  

Keep an eye out for the breakout above the 6750 res.  Good luck!

There are so many amazing traders providing signs in this website or in many others, most of the time they are quite close but sometimes even when everything and everyone thinks  BTC 3.01%  will go up; BOOM suddenly starts to go down.  

The truth is that with barely $300 billion in total market cap in the crypto world, it is really easy  fo 0.00%  whales to manipulate the prices and not even the best trader can see when the manipulation is coming.  

BTC 3.01%  WILL GO UP FOR SURE, and we want to get in when that happens but at the same time we don't want to lose money guessing when this will happen. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN. So, why not betting for both positions SHORT and LONG at the same time. In this way, you will be IN when  BTC 3.01%  goes to the moon and you will be prepared to not lose your money if the price goes down.  

How? 

Simple! You can open two Bitmex accounts and go for a long position with the 50% of your investment in one of the accounts, and go for a short position with the other 50% in the other account. Set up a close action in the short position when the price drops 10% and if the price goes up, be ready to close the position anytime you want after the prices are more than 10% up. (This is only if you are using 10x leverage)

Hello, this will be my first post, let's get into it. 

BTC 3.01%  is finally showing signs of life as it broke out from the  downtrend channel  on July 2.  You can easily see the breakout on the 4hr chart, as the shorter 20 MA has crossed the 50 MA for the first signs of strength in a long time.  The problem is  BTC 3.01%  is facing two huge resistances, the first being where we are at now as I am writing this, about 6750.  If  BTC 3.01%  breaks through that, it would be an excellent medium term buy signal up to around the next res, around 7600-7700.  Further analysis would be needed at that particular point.  I do believe the bottom is behind us, as we double bottomed on 6/24 & 6/29.  Surges of  volume  are finally seen after weeks of exhausted bulls.   ADX  shows positive buy momentum and the beginnings of a steady uptrend.  

Keep an eye out for the breakout above the 6750 res.  Good luck!

Set up a close action in the short position when the price drops 10% and if the price goes up, be ready to close the position anytime you want after the prices are more than 10% up. (This is only if you are using 10x leverage)  

The entire strategy is HERE. Don't worry it's an article, no one will sell you anything.

Hello, this will be my first post, let's get into it. 

BTC 3.01%  is finally showing signs of life as it broke out from the  downtrend channel  on July 2.  You can easily see the breakout on the 4hr chart, as the shorter 20 MA has crossed the 50 MA for the first signs of strength in a long time.  The problem is  BTC 3.01%  is facing two huge resistances, the first being where we are at now as I am writing this, about 6750.  If  BTC 3.01%  breaks through that, it would be an excellent medium term buy signal up to around the next res, around 7600-7700.  Further analysis would be needed at that particular point.  I do believe the bottom is behind us, as we double bottomed on 6/24 & 6/29.  Surges of  volume  are finally seen after weeks of exhausted bulls.   ADX  shows positive buy momentum and the beginnings of a steady uptrend.  

Keep an eye out for the breakout above the 6750 res.  Good luck!

There are so many amazing traders providing signs in this website or in many others, most of the time they are quite close but sometimes even when everything and everyone thinks  BTC 2.95%  will go up; BOOM suddenly starts to go down.  

The truth is that with barely $300 billion in total market cap in the crypto world, it is really easy  fo              whales to manipulate the prices and not even the best trader can see when the manipulation is coming.  

BTC 2.95%  WILL GO UP FOR SURE, and we want to get in when that happens but at the same time we don't want to lose money guessing when this will happen. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN. So, why not betting for both positions SHORT and LONG at the same time. In this way, you will be IN when  BTC 2.95%  goes to the moon and you will be prepared to not lose your money if the price goes down.  

How? 

Simple! You can open two Bitmex accounts and go for a long position with the 50% of your investment in one of the accounts, and go for a short position with the other 50% in the other account.

There are so many amazing traders providing signs in this website or in many others, most of the time they are quite close but sometimes even when everything and everyone thinks  BTC 2.92%  will go up; BOOM suddenly starts to go down.  

The truth is that with barely $300 billion in total market cap in the crypto world, it is really easy  fo 0.00%  whales to manipulate the prices and not even the best trader can see when the manipulation is coming.  

BTC 2.92%  WILL GO UP FOR SURE, and we want to get in when that happens but at the same time we don't want to lose money guessing when this will happen. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN. So, why not betting for both positions SHORT and LONG at the same time. In this way, you will be IN when  BTC 2.92%  goes to the moon and you will be prepared to not lose your money if the price goes down.  

How? 

Simple! You can open two Bitmex accounts and go for a long position with the 50% of your investment in one of the accounts, and go for a short position with the other 50% in the other account. Set up a close action in the short position when the price drops 10% and if the price goes up, be ready to close the position anytime you want after the prices are more than 10% up. (This is only if you are using 10x leverage)  

The entire strategy is HERE. Don't worry it's an article, no one will sell you anything.

Hello, this will be my first post, let's get into it. 

BTC 2.91%  is finally showing signs of life as it broke out from the  downtrend channel  on July 2.  You can easily see the breakout on the 4hr chart, as the shorter 20 MA has crossed the 50 MA for the first signs of strength in a long time.  The problem is  BTC 2.91%  is facing two huge resistances, the first being where we are at now as I am writing this, about 6750.  If  BTC 2.91%  breaks through that, it would be an excellent medium term buy signal up to around the next res, around 7600-7700.  Further analysis would be needed at that particular point.  I do believe the bottom is behind us, as we double bottomed on 6/24 & 6/29.  Surges of  volume  are finally seen after weeks of exhausted bulls.   ADX  shows positive buy momentum and the beginnings of a steady uptrend.  

Keep an eye out for the breakout above the 6750 res.  Good luck!

There are so many amazing traders providing signs in this website or in many others, most of the time they are quite close but sometimes even when everything and everyone thinks  BTC              will go up; BOOM suddenly starts to go down.  

The truth is that with barely $300 billion in total market cap in the crypto world, it is really easy  fo              whales to manipulate the prices and not even the best trader can see when the manipulation is coming.  

BTC              WILL GO UP FOR SURE, and we want to get in when that happens but at the same time we don't want to lose money guessing when this will happen. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN. So, why not betting for both positions SHORT and LONG at the same time. In this way, you will be IN when  BTC              goes to the moon and you will be prepared to not lose your money if the price goes down.  

How? 

Simple! You can open two Bitmex accounts and go for a long position with the 50% of your investment in one of the accounts, and go for a short position with the other 50% in the other account. Set up a close action in the short position when the price drops 10% and if the price goes up, be ready to close the position anytime you want after the prices are more than 10% up. (This is only if you are using 10x leverage)

Hello, this will be my first post, let's get into it. 

BTC              is finally showing signs of life as it broke out from the  downtrend channel  on July 2.  You can easily see the breakout on the 4hr chart, as the shorter 20 MA has crossed the 50 MA for the first signs of strength in a long time.  The problem is  BTC              is facing two huge resistances, the first being where we are at now as I am writing this, about 6750.  If  BTC              breaks through that, it would be an excellent medium term buy signal up to around the next res, around 7600-7700.  Further analysis would be needed at that particular point.  I do believe the bottom is behind us, as we double bottomed on 6/24 & 6/29.  Surges of  volume  are finally seen after weeks of exhausted bulls.   ADX  shows positive buy momentum and the beginnings of a steady uptrend.  

Keep an eye out for the breakout above the 6750 res.  Good luck!

Set up a close action in the short position when the price drops 10% and if the price goes up, be ready to close the position anytime you want after the prices are more than 10% up. (This is only if you are using 10x leverage)

Hello, this will be my first post, let's get into it. 

BTC 2.81%  is finally showing signs of life as it broke out from the  downtrend channel  on July 2.  You can easily see the breakout on the 4hr chart, as the shorter 20 MA has crossed the 50 MA for the first signs of strength in a long time.  The problem is  BTC 2.81%  is facing two huge resistances, the first being where we are at now as I am writing this, about 6750.  If  BTC 2.81%  breaks through that, it would be an excellent medium term buy signal up to around the next res, around 7600-7700.  Further analysis would be needed at that particular point.  I do believe the bottom is behind us, as we double bottomed on 6/24 & 6/29.  Surges of  volume  are finally seen after weeks of exhausted bulls.   ADX  shows positive buy momentum and the beginnings of a steady uptrend.  

Keep an eye out for the breakout above the 6750 res.  Good luck!

There are so many amazing traders providing signs in this website or in many others, most of the time they are quite close but sometimes even when everything and everyone thinks  BTC 2.80%  will go up; BOOM suddenly starts to go down.  

The truth is that with barely $300 billion in total market cap in the crypto world, it is really easy  fo              whales to manipulate the prices and not even the best trader can see when the manipulation is coming.  

BTC 2.80%  WILL GO UP FOR SURE, and we want to get in when that happens but at the same time we don't want to lose money guessing when this will happen. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN. So, why not betting for both positions SHORT and LONG at the same time. In this way, you will be IN when  BTC 2.80%  goes to the moon and you will be prepared to not lose your money if the price goes down.

There are so many amazing traders providing signs in this website or in many others, most of the time they are quite close but sometimes even when everything and everyone thinks  BTC 2.80%  will go up; BOOM suddenly starts to go down.  

The truth is that with barely $300 billion in total market cap in the crypto world, it is really easy  fo              whales to manipulate the prices and not even the best trader can see when the manipulation is coming.  

BTC 2.80%  WILL GO UP FOR SURE, and we want to get in when that happens but at the same time we don't want to lose money guessing when this will happen. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN. So, why not betting for both positions SHORT and LONG at the same time. In this way, you will be IN when  BTC 2.80%  goes to the moon and you will be prepared to not lose your money if the price goes down.  

How? 

Simple! You can open two Bitmex accounts and go for a long position with the 50% of your investment in one of the accounts, and go for a short position with the other 50% in the other account. Set up a close action in the short position when the price drops 10% and if the price goes up, be ready to close the position anytime you want after the prices are more than 10% up. (This is only if you are using 10x leverage)

Hello, this will be my first post, let's get into it. 

BTC 2.80%  is finally showing signs of life as it broke out from the  downtrend channel  on July 2.  You can easily see the breakout on the 4hr chart, as the shorter 20 MA has crossed the 50 MA for the first signs of strength in a long time.  The problem is  BTC 2.80%  is facing two huge resistances, the first being where we are at now as I am writing this, about 6750.  If  BTC 2.80%  breaks through that, it would be an excellent medium term buy signal up to around the next res, around 7600-7700.  Further analysis would be needed at that particular point.  I do believe the bottom is behind us, as we double bottomed on 6/24 & 6/29.  Surges of  volume  are finally seen after weeks of exhausted bulls.   ADX  shows positive buy momentum and the beginnings of a steady uptrend.  

Keep an eye out for the breakout above the 6750 res.  Good luck!

There are so many amazing traders providing signs in this website or in many others, most of the time they are quite close but sometimes even when everything and everyone thinks  BTC 2.80%  will go up; BOOM suddenly starts to go down.  

The truth is that with barely $300 billion in total market cap in the crypto world, it is really easy  fo              whales to manipulate the prices and not even the best trader can see when the manipulation is coming.  

BTC 2.80%  WILL GO UP FOR SURE, and we want to get in when that happens but at the same time we don't want to lose money guessing when this will happen. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN. So, why not betting for both positions SHORT and LONG at the same time. In this way, you will be IN when  BTC 2.80%  goes to the moon and you will be prepared to not lose your money if the price goes down.  

How? 

Simple! You can open two Bitmex accounts and go for a long position with the 50% of your investment in one of the accounts, and go for a short position with the other 50% in the other account. Set up a close action in the short position when the price drops 10% and if the price goes up, be ready to close the position anytime you want after the prices are more than 10% up. (This is only if you are using 10x leverage)  

The entire strategy is HERE. Don't worry it's an article, no one will sell you anything.

Hello, this will be my first post, let's get into it. 

BTC 2.80%  is finally showing signs of life as it broke out from the  downtrend channel  on July 2.  You can easily see the breakout on the 4hr chart, as the shorter 20 MA has crossed the 50 MA for the first signs of strength in a long time.  The problem is  BTC 2.80%  is facing two huge resistances, the first being where we are at now as I am writing this, about 6750.  If  BTC 2.80%  breaks through that, it would be an excellent medium term buy signal up to around the next res, around 7600-7700.  Further analysis would be needed at that particular point.  I do believe the bottom is behind us, as we double bottomed on 6/24 & 6/29.  Surges of  volume  are finally seen after weeks of exhausted bulls.   ADX  shows positive buy momentum and the beginnings of a steady uptrend.  

Keep an eye out for the breakout above the 6750 res.  Good luck!

Set up a close action in the short position when the price drops 10% and if the price goes up, be ready to close the position anytime you want after the prices are more than 10% up. (This is only if you are using 10x leverage)

Hello, this will be my first post, let's get into it. 

BTC 2.80%  is finally showing signs of life as it broke out from the  downtrend channel  on July 2.  You can easily see the breakout on the 4hr chart, as the shorter 20 MA has crossed the 50 MA for the first signs of strength in a long time.  The problem is  BTC 2.80%  is facing two huge resistances, the first being where we are at now as I am writing this, about 6750.  If  BTC 2.80%  breaks through that, it would be an excellent medium term buy signal up to around the next res, around 7600-7700.  Further analysis would be needed at that particular point.  I do believe the bottom is behind us, as we double bottomed on 6/24 & 6/29.  Surges of  volume  are finally seen after weeks of exhausted bulls.   ADX  shows positive buy momentum and the beginnings of a steady uptrend.  

Keep an eye out for the breakout above the 6750 res.  Good luck!

There are so many amazing traders providing signs in this website or in many others, most of the time they are quite close but sometimes even when everything and everyone thinks  BTC 2.80%  will go up; BOOM suddenly starts to go down.  

The truth is that with barely $300 billion in total market cap in the crypto world, it is really easy  fo              whales to manipulate the prices and not even the best trader can see when the manipulation is coming.  

BTC 2.80%  WILL GO UP FOR SURE, and we want to get in when that happens but at the same time we don't want to lose money guessing when this will happen. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN. So, why not betting for both positions SHORT and LONG at the same time. In this way, you will be IN when  BTC 2.80%  goes to the moon and you will be prepared to not lose your money if the price goes down.

Simple! You can open two Bitmex accounts and go for a long position with the 50% of your investment in one of the accounts, and go for a short position with the other 50% in the other account.

There are so many amazing traders providing signs in this website or in many others, most of the time they are quite close but sometimes even when everything and everyone thinks  BTC 2.80%  will go up; BOOM suddenly starts to go down.  

The truth is that with barely $300 billion in total market cap in the crypto world, it is really easy  fo              whales to manipulate the prices and not even the best trader can see when the manipulation is coming.  

BTC 2.80%  WILL GO UP FOR SURE, and we want to get in when that happens but at the same time we don't want to lose money guessing when this will happen. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN. So, why not betting for both positions SHORT and LONG at the same time. In this way, you will be IN when  BTC 2.80%  goes to the moon and you will be prepared to not lose your money if the price goes down.  

How? 

Simple! You can open two Bitmex accounts and go for a long position with the 50% of your investment in one of the accounts, and go for a short position with the other 50% in the other account. Set up a close action in the short position when the price drops 10% and if the price goes up, be ready to close the position anytime you want after the prices are more than 10% up. (This is only if you are using 10x leverage)  

The entire strategy is HERE. Don't worry it's an article, no one will sell you anything.

Hello, this will be my first post, let's get into it. 

BTC 2.80%  is finally showing signs of life as it broke out from the  downtrend channel  on July 2.  You can easily see the breakout on the 4hr chart, as the shorter 20 MA has crossed the 50 MA for the first signs of strength in a long time.  The problem is  BTC 2.80%  is facing two huge resistances, the first being where we are at now as I am writing this, about 6750.  If  BTC 2.80%  breaks through that, it would be an excellent medium term buy signal up to around the next res, around 7600-7700.  Further analysis would be needed at that particular point.  I do believe the bottom is behind us, as we double bottomed on 6/24 & 6/29.  Surges of  volume  are finally seen after weeks of exhausted bulls.   ADX  shows positive buy momentum and the beginnings of a steady uptrend.  

Keep an eye out for the breakout above the 6750 res.  Good luck!

There are so many amazing traders providing signs in this website or in many others, most of the time they are quite close but sometimes even when everything and everyone thinks  BTC 2.79%  will go up; BOOM suddenly starts to go down.  

The truth is that with barely $300 billion in total market cap in the crypto world, it is really easy  fo 0.00%  whales to manipulate the prices and not even the best trader can see when the manipulation is coming.  

BTC 2.79%  WILL GO UP FOR SURE, and we want to get in when that happens but at the same time we don't want to lose money guessing when this will happen. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN. So, why not betting for both positions SHORT and LONG at the same time. In this way, you will be IN when  BTC 2.79%  goes to the moon and you will be prepared to not lose your money if the price goes down.  

How? 

Simple! You can open two Bitmex accounts and go for a long position with the 50% of your investment in one of the accounts, and go for a short position with the other 50% in the other account. Set up a close action in the short position when the price drops 10% and if the price goes up, be ready to close the position anytime you want after the prices are more than 10% up. (This is only if you are using 10x leverage)  

The entire strategy is HERE. Don't worry it's an article, no one will sell you anything.

Hello, this will be my first post, let's get into it. 

BTC 2.80%  is finally showing signs of life as it broke out from the  downtrend channel  on July 2.  You can easily see the breakout on the 4hr chart, as the shorter 20 MA has crossed the 50 MA for the first signs of strength in a long time.  The problem is  BTC 2.80%  is facing two huge resistances, the first being where we are at now as I am writing this, about 6750.  If  BTC 2.80%  breaks through that, it would be an excellent medium term buy signal up to around the next res, around 7600-7700.  Further analysis would be needed at that particular point.  I do believe the bottom is behind us, as we double bottomed on 6/24 & 6/29.  Surges of  volume  are finally seen after weeks of exhausted bulls.   ADX  shows positive buy momentum and the beginnings of a steady uptrend.  

Keep an eye out for the breakout above the 6750 res.  Good luck!

Set up a close action in the short position when the price drops 10% and if the price goes up, be ready to close the position anytime you want after the prices are more than 10% up. (This is only if you are using 10x leverage)  

The entire strategy is HERE. Don't worry it's an article, no one will sell you anything.

Hello, this will be my first post, let's get into it. 

BTC 2.69%  is finally showing signs of life as it broke out from the  downtrend channel  on July 2.  You can easily see the breakout on the 4hr chart, as the shorter 20 MA has crossed the 50 MA for the first signs of strength in a long time.  The problem is  BTC 2.69%  is facing two huge resistances, the first being where we are at now as I am writing this, about 6750.  If  BTC 2.69%  breaks through that, it would be an excellent medium term buy signal up to around the next res, around 7600-7700.  Further analysis would be needed at that particular point.  I do believe the bottom is behind us, as we double bottomed on 6/24 & 6/29.  Surges of  volume  are finally seen after weeks of exhausted bulls.   ADX  shows positive buy momentum and the beginnings of a steady uptrend.  

Keep an eye out for the breakout above the 6750 res.  Good luck!

There are so many amazing traders providing signs in this website or in many others, most of the time they are quite close but sometimes even when everything and everyone thinks  BTC 2.69%  will go up; BOOM suddenly starts to go down.  

The truth is that with barely $300 billion in total market cap in the crypto world, it is really easy  fo 0.00%  whales to manipulate the prices and not even the best trader can see when the manipulation is coming.  

BTC 2.69%  WILL GO UP FOR SURE, and we want to get in when that happens but at the same time we don't want to lose money guessing when this will happen. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN. So, why not betting for both positions SHORT and LONG at the same time. In this way, you will be IN when  BTC 2.69%  goes to the moon and you will be prepared to not lose your money if the price goes down.  

How? 

Simple! You can open two Bitmex accounts and go for a long position with the 50% of your investment in one of the accounts, and go for a short position with the other 50% in the other account.

There are so many amazing traders providing signs in this website or in many others, most of the time they are quite close but sometimes even when everything and everyone thinks  BTC 2.69%  will go up; BOOM suddenly starts to go down.  

The truth is that with barely $300 billion in total market cap in the crypto world, it is really easy  fo              whales to manipulate the prices and not even the best trader can see when the manipulation is coming.  

BTC 2.69%  WILL GO UP FOR SURE, and we want to get in when that happens but at the same time we don't want to lose money guessing when this will happen. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN. So, why not betting for both positions SHORT and LONG at the same time. In this way, you will be IN when  BTC 2.69%  goes to the moon and you will be prepared to not lose your money if the price goes down.  

How? 

Simple! You can open two Bitmex accounts and go for a long position with the 50% of your investment in one of the accounts, and go for a short position with the other 50% in the other account. Set up a close action in the short position when the price drops 10% and if the price goes up, be ready to close the position anytime you want after the prices are more than 10% up. (This is only if you are using 10x leverage)

Hello, this will be my first post, let's get into it. 

BTC 2.69%  is finally showing signs of life as it broke out from the  downtrend channel  on July 2.  You can easily see the breakout on the 4hr chart, as the shorter 20 MA has crossed the 50 MA for the first signs of strength in a long time.  The problem is  BTC 2.69%  is facing two huge resistances, the first being where we are at now as I am writing this, about 6750.  If  BTC 2.69%  breaks through that, it would be an excellent medium term buy signal up to around the next res, around 7600-7700.  Further analysis would be needed at that particular point.  I do believe the bottom is behind us, as we double bottomed on 6/24 & 6/29.  Surges of  volume  are finally seen after weeks of exhausted bulls.   ADX  shows positive buy momentum and the beginnings of a steady uptrend.  

Keep an eye out for the breakout above the 6750 res.  Good luck!

The  Elliott Wave  Principle and market oscillators interpretation is a detailed description of how financial markets behave. The description reveals that mass psychology swings from pessimism to optimism and back in a natural sequence, creating specific  Elliott wave  patterns in price movements. Each pattern has implications regarding the position of the market within its overall progression, past, present and future. The purpose of  Elliott Wave  counting market-oriented publications is to outline the progress of markets in terms of the Wave Principle and to educate interested parties in the successful application of the Wave Principle. While a course of conduct regarding investments can be formulated from such application of the Wave Principle, at no time will Cosmin Bogdan Pavel will make specific recommendations for any specific person, and at no time may a reader, caller or viewer be justified in inferring that any such advice is intended. Investing carries risk of losses, and trading  futures  or options is especially risky because these instruments are highly leveraged, and traders can lose more than their initial margin funds. Information provided by Cosmin Bogdan Pavel is expressed in good faith, but it is not guaranteed. The market service that never makes mistakes does not exist. Long-term success trading or investing in the markets demands recognition of the fact that error and uncertainty are part of any effort to assess future probabilities.

The latest pump (I am happy I was long on that!) has hit resistance. If we fall outside of this  rising wedge  it could tank us right to the bottom again.

Comment:
					Note: This is worst case scenario. A break to the down side might only send us as low as the rising back dotted trend line where it would intersect near the April low which provided support yesterday.

		Weekly 
Looking at our trend timeframe we see price has found support at our $6,000 level, does this mean the bear market is over? A weekly close above $8,000 would indicate our bear market is over according to my analysis. Expecting a rejection once $7,500 is reached,  stochastic rsi  showing momentum is heading towards the upside. 






		Daily 
Shifting over to our pattern timeframe we see price has broke out of its aggressive downtrend, and tested for support.  Stochastic RSI  showing momentum has peaked, a daily close above $6,750 activates our 2nd trade and we should see a run towards $7,500. 






		4Hour 
Finally looking at our trigger timeframe we see  BTC 2.69%  forming higher highs and higher lows, A close above $6,600 gets us an early next for the next  bullish  wave.

There are so many amazing traders providing signs in this website or in many others, most of the time they are quite close but sometimes even when everything and everyone thinks  BTC 2.69%  will go up; BOOM suddenly starts to go down.  

The truth is that with barely $300 billion in total market cap in the crypto world, it is really easy  fo              whales to manipulate the prices and not even the best trader can see when the manipulation is coming.  

BTC 2.69%  WILL GO UP FOR SURE, and we want to get in when that happens but at the same time we don't want to lose money guessing when this will happen. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN. So, why not betting for both positions SHORT and LONG at the same time. In this way, you will be IN when  BTC 2.69%  goes to the moon and you will be prepared to not lose your money if the price goes down.  

How? 

Simple! You can open two Bitmex accounts and go for a long position with the 50% of your investment in one of the accounts, and go for a short position with the other 50% in the other account. Set up a close action in the short position when the price drops 10% and if the price goes up, be ready to close the position anytime you want after the prices are more than 10% up. (This is only if you are using 10x leverage)  

The entire strategy is HERE. Don't worry it's an article, no one will sell you anything.

1530712232.0,jcc07,BTC - Signs of Life,"
Hello, this will be my first post, let's get into it. 

BTC 2.69%  is finally showing signs of life as it broke out from the  downtrend channel  on July 2.  You can easily see the breakout on the 4hr chart, as the shorter 20 MA has crossed the 50 MA for the first signs of strength in a long time.  The problem is  BTC 2.69%  is facing two huge resistances, the first being where we are at now as I am writing this, about 6750.  If  BTC 2.69%  breaks through that, it would be an excellent medium term buy signal up to around the next res, around 7600-7700.  Further analysis would be needed at that particular point.  I do believe the bottom is behind us, as we double bottomed on 6/24 & 6/29.  Surges of  volume  are finally seen after weeks of exhausted bulls.   ADX  shows positive buy momentum and the beginnings of a steady uptrend.  

Keep an eye out for the breakout above the 6750 res.  Good luck! 

(Not financial advice, obviously...)
