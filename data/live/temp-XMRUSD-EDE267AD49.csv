Price is showing nice respect of the Lower parallel with a historical setup and there is cross confluence with other cryptos and  US Dollar -0.06%  moves suggesting a reversal may be under way.  Stick a stop at the base of the fork or a few ticks below the previous swing low.  Targeting Quarter Line and  Median Line .

1531098394.0,artthurrr,XMR - MONERO - HOW LOW CAN YOU GO? - LONG TERM PLAY,"
XMR HAS BEEN LOSING SOME MARKET SHARE TO OTHER PRIVACY COINS. BUT LOOK FOR MONERO TO STORM BACK DURING BULL SEASON AND LEAD THE WAY IN PRIVACY COINS. 
THE BOTTOM IS NOT YET IN, BUT LOOK TO ACCUMULATE WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS TO COMING MONTHS. THIS IS LONG TERM PLAY AND MAY BE REWARDED HANDSOMELY FOR YOUR PATIENCE IN 6-18+ MONTHS.  

-EXPECT A BEAR TREND FOR THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. THAT WAY YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AS EXPECTED BY END OF THIS YEAR. PATIENCE WILL PAY OFF. 

-CHOOSE TO TRADE IN LOW RISK, HIGH REWARD TRADE SETUP'S.  

-Good Luck Traders,
