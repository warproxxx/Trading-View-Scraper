Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.68% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.68%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ 0.00%  will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far. 

Enjoy your wallet!

 ETHUSD 1.74%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.74%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.74%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.73%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.73%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.73%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.73%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold. I think Andreessen Horowitz' recent big bet to start a 300 million crypto fund is a  bullish  expression and that the crypto markets deserve some analysis here.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.73% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.68%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.68%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.68%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

this guy that poked through the support is a bit of game changer, now price reached fib 0.3 of both moves.

Comment:






Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.76%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.75% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.75%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ 0.00%  will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far.

 ETHUSD 1.82%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.82%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.82%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.82%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.82%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.82%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.82%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold. I think Andreessen Horowitz' recent big bet to start a 300 million crypto fund is a  bullish  expression and that the crypto markets deserve some analysis here.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.88% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.75%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.75%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

Hello Traders! As we can see from the chart,  BITFINEX:ETHUSD 1.91%  has recently broken the trend-line is was capped by. We can see that the $400s if a very strong area of demand dating back to the last major rally at the end of 2017. 

We are entering long on  BITFINEX:ETHUSD 1.91%  with a final target at $1028.00 which is also where the 61.8% Fibo retracement will be found.

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.91%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold. I think Andreessen Horowitz' recent big bet to start a 300 million crypto fund is a  bullish  expression and that the crypto markets deserve some analysis here.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.91% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.78%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.78%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.79%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF              0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.79%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance.

All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far.

 ETHUSD 1.91%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.91%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.91%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.92%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.92%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.92%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.92%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.92%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.92%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold. I think Andreessen Horowitz' recent big bet to start a 300 million crypto fund is a  bullish  expression and that the crypto markets deserve some analysis here.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.92% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.88%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.88%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC              2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF              0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.88% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.88%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ              will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far.

 ETHUSD 1.92%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

Comment:






Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.88% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.88%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ 0.00%  will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far. 

Enjoy your wallet!

 ETHUSD 1.92%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.92%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.92%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.92%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.92%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.92%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.92%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.92% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.93%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.93%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.97%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 1.08%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC             . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC              for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ              will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far.

 ETHUSD 1.77%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.72%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.72%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.72%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.72%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.72%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.72%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold. I think Andreessen Horowitz' recent big bet to start a 300 million crypto fund is a  bullish  expression and that the crypto markets deserve some analysis here.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.76% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.91%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.91%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

 Ethereum 1.81%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.81%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.81%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

Hello Traders! As we can see from the chart,  BITFINEX:ETHUSD 1.81%  has recently broken the trend-line is was capped by. We can see that the $400s if a very strong area of demand dating back to the last major rally at the end of 2017. 

We are entering long on  BITFINEX:ETHUSD 1.81%  with a final target at $1028.00 which is also where the 61.8% Fibo retracement will be found.

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.81%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold. I think Andreessen Horowitz' recent big bet to start a 300 million crypto fund is a  bullish  expression and that the crypto markets deserve some analysis here.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.81% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.95%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.95%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.96%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.96% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.96%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ              will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance.

All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far.

 ETHUSD 1.81%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.76%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.76%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.76%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.76%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.67%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.67%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.67%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.67%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold. I think Andreessen Horowitz' recent big bet to start a 300 million crypto fund is a  bullish  expression and that the crypto markets deserve some analysis here.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.67% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.96%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.96%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.96%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

this guy that poked through the support is a bit of game changer, now price reached fib 0.3 of both moves.

Comment:






Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.96% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.96%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ 0.00%  will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far.

 ETHUSD 1.67%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

this guy that poked through the support is a bit of game changer, now price reached fib 0.3 of both moves. 
We could now be doing a shallower version of that triangle. 
We'll know if we touch the top instead of turning south at the orange target.

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.80% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.80%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ              will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far. 

Enjoy your wallet!

 ETHUSD 1.52%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.52%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.52%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.52%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.52%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.52%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.52%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.52% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.76%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.76%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.76%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.77%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF              0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

Comment:






Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.77% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.77%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ 0.00%  will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far.

 ETHUSD 1.52%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.52%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.52%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.52%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.52%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.52%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum              almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.52% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.80%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.80%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

2. The  ETHUSD 1.52%  rate may continue to grow to $ 500.

 Ethereum 1.52%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.52%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.52%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

Hello Traders! As we can see from the chart,  BITFINEX:ETHUSD 1.56%  has recently broken the trend-line is was capped by. We can see that the $400s if a very strong area of demand dating back to the last major rally at the end of 2017. 

We are entering long on  BITFINEX:ETHUSD 1.56%  with a final target at $1028.00 which is also where the 61.8% Fibo retracement will be found.

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.56%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold. I think Andreessen Horowitz' recent big bet to start a 300 million crypto fund is a  bullish  expression and that the crypto markets deserve some analysis here.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.56% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.80%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.80%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.80%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance.

 ETHUSD 1.56%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.56%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.56%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.60%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.60%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.64%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.64%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.64%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.64%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold. I think Andreessen Horowitz' recent big bet to start a 300 million crypto fund is a  bullish  expression and that the crypto markets deserve some analysis here.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.64% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.80%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.80%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.80%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

this guy that poked through the support is a bit of game changer, now price reached fib 0.3 of both moves. 
We could now be doing a shallower version of that triangle.

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.80% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.80%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ 0.00%  will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far.

 ETHUSD 1.64%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

this guy that poked through the support is a bit of game changer, now price reached fib 0.3 of both moves. 
We could now be doing a shallower version of that triangle. 
We'll know if we touch the top instead of turning south at the orange target.

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.83% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.83%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ 0.00%  will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far.

 ETHUSD 1.64%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.64%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.64%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.64%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.64%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.64%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.64%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.64% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.80%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.80%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.84%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF              0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.83%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.83% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.83%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ 0.00%  will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far.

 ETHUSD 1.64%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.64%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.64%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.63%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.63%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.63%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.55%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold. I think Andreessen Horowitz' recent big bet to start a 300 million crypto fund is a  bullish  expression and that the crypto markets deserve some analysis here.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.55% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.83%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.83%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD 1.50% . 
Today, quotation of  Ethereum 1.50%  will continue consolidation in the price range: $ 480 - $ 450.

 Ethereum 1.50%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.50%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.50%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

Hello Traders! As we can see from the chart,  BITFINEX:ETHUSD              has recently broken the trend-line is was capped by. We can see that the $400s if a very strong area of demand dating back to the last major rally at the end of 2017. 

We are entering long on  BITFINEX:ETHUSD              with a final target at $1028.00 which is also where the 61.8% Fibo retracement will be found.

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.50%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold. I think Andreessen Horowitz' recent big bet to start a 300 million crypto fund is a  bullish  expression and that the crypto markets deserve some analysis here.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.50% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.75%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.75%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.71%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC             . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC              for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance.

 ETHUSD 1.42%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.24%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.24%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.29%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.29%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.33%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.33%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.33%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.33%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold. I think Andreessen Horowitz' recent big bet to start a 300 million crypto fund is a  bullish  expression and that the crypto markets deserve some analysis here.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.33% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.62%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.62%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.62%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

this guy that poked through the support is a bit of game changer, now price reached fib 0.3 of both moves. 
We could now be doing a shallower version of that triangle.

Comment:






Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.62% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.62%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ 0.00%  will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far.

 ETHUSD 1.33%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.

CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

this guy that poked through the support is a bit of game changer, now price reached fib 0.3 of both moves. 
We could now be doing a shallower version of that triangle.

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.65% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.65%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far.

 ETHUSD 1.33%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.33%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.33%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.33%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.33%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.33%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.33%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.33% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.65%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.65%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.65%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.65%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.65%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.65%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.65% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.65%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ 0.00%  will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far.

 ETHUSD 1.42%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.55%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.55%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.57%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.57%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.57%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.47%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold.

 Ethereum 1.47%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.47%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.47%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.47%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold. I think Andreessen Horowitz' recent big bet to start a 300 million crypto fund is a  bullish  expression and that the crypto markets deserve some analysis here.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.47% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.67%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.67%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.67%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.67% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.67%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ 0.00%  will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far.

 ETHUSD 1.47%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.47%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.47%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 ETHUSD 1.47%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.37%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.37%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.32%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.32%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.32%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.32%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.32% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.52%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.52%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.50%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

this guy that poked through the support is a bit of game changer, now price reached fib 0.3 of both moves. 
We could now be doing a shallower version of that triangle.

Comment:






Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.50% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.50%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ              will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.52%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.52% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.52%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ 0.00%  will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far.

 ETHUSD 1.48%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.43%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.43%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.43%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.43%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.43%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.43%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.42% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.54%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.54%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.50%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold. I think Andreessen Horowitz' recent big bet to start a 300 million crypto fund is a  bullish  expression and that the crypto markets deserve some analysis here.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.50% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.54%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.54%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.54%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.54% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.54%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ 0.00%  will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far.

 ETHUSD 1.50%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.50%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.50%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.50%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.50%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.50%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.50%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.50%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.50%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.50%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold. I think Andreessen Horowitz' recent big bet to start a 300 million crypto fund is a  bullish  expression and that the crypto markets deserve some analysis here.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.50% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.66%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.66%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.66%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.66% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.66%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ 0.00%  will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far.

 ETHUSD 1.50%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.50%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.50%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ 0.00%  will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far. 

Enjoy your wallet!

 ETHUSD 1.50%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.50%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.50%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum              has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum              is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum              is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.50%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.50% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD              says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD              will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.73%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

this guy that poked through the support is a bit of game changer, now price reached fib 0.3 of both moves.

Comment:






Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.73%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF -0.17%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC             . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC              for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ              will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far.

 ETHUSD 1.50%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD              chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum              to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum              has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum              is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum              is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.50%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold. I think Andreessen Horowitz' recent big bet to start a 300 million crypto fund is a  bullish  expression and that the crypto markets deserve some analysis here.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.50% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD              says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD              will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

Hello Traders! As we can see from the chart,  BITFINEX:ETHUSD              has recently broken the trend-line is was capped by. We can see that the $400s if a very strong area of demand dating back to the last major rally at the end of 2017. 

We are entering long on  BITFINEX:ETHUSD              with a final target at $1028.00 which is also where the 61.8% Fibo retracement will be found.

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.50%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold. I think Andreessen Horowitz' recent big bet to start a 300 million crypto fund is a  bullish  expression and that the crypto markets deserve some analysis here.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.50% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD              says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD              will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.73%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF -0.17%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.73% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.73%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ 0.00%  will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance.

All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far.

 ETHUSD 1.54%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.54%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.54%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.54%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.54%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.54%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.53%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.53%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.53%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.53%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold. I think Andreessen Horowitz' recent big bet to start a 300 million crypto fund is a  bullish  expression and that the crypto markets deserve some analysis here.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.52% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.73%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.73%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.73%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF -0.17%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.73% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.73%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ              will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far.

 ETHUSD 1.52%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.52%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.52%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .

It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far. 

Enjoy your wallet!

 ETHUSD 1.50%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.50%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.50%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.50%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.50%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.50%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.50%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.50% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.69%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.69%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.68%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

this guy that poked through the support is a bit of game changer, now price reached fib 0.3 of both moves.

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.61%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF 0.14%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.61% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.61%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ 0.00%  will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far.

 ETHUSD 1.32%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.32%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.32%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.32%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.32%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.32%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum              almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.32% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.47%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.47%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

Hello Traders! As we can see from the chart,  BITFINEX:ETHUSD              has recently broken the trend-line is was capped by. We can see that the $400s if a very strong area of demand dating back to the last major rally at the end of 2017. 

We are entering long on  BITFINEX:ETHUSD              with a final target at $1028.00 which is also where the 61.8% Fibo retracement will be found.

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.32%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold. I think Andreessen Horowitz' recent big bet to start a 300 million crypto fund is a  bullish  expression and that the crypto markets deserve some analysis here.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.32% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.45%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.45%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.45%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF -0.17%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.45%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance.

 ETHUSD 1.30%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.30%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.30%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.29%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.29%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum              has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum              is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum              is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.29%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold. I think Andreessen Horowitz' recent big bet to start a 300 million crypto fund is a  bullish  expression and that the crypto markets deserve some analysis here.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.29% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.51%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.51%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.51%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF              0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC             . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC              for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ              will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far.

 ETHUSD 1.25%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily

Tons of fake outs and wicks on  BTC 0.41% . Not as many on ETH and other names.  
Very clear pattern to be watching with no fake outs at this point.  
Looking for a break of this 4 hour tightening range sometime today to indicate continuation of the bounce or daily consolidation.  
Traders being patient and waiting for breaks if not already in positions, but must be cautious and watch  BTC 0.41%  for potential fake outs.  
Last 2 days we have seen bull pumps 2 hours from now, and keeping an eye out for a repeat.  
Bull break of the 4 hour  EQ              will result in a 4 hour bull  MACD  cross which would have bulls set their sights on $500.

Hi guys, 

more or less we touch the bottom, or at least I hope! 

So the price first rebounded on the green support, after crossed over the blue channel resistance. 
Oscillator in that time went out the oversold area.  
All this confirms my idea of trend inversion, and to go long is the best idea for me so far. 

Enjoy your wallet!

 ETHUSD 1.10%  is at a level where it soon can present 2 long opportunities. 

1) if we break the downtrend line (green), then the red line will trigger a buy with a stop under recent meaningful  support zone 

2) if we keep going according to the count and reach 380s-370s, then another long opportunity will arise there with min target of  0.382 retracement 

For each scenario the trades' entries, targets and stops (stops and targets may be adjusted with further evaluation, those are just quick-glance targets/stops with the price data available at the moment) 

If you have suggestions or think I've missed something important or you disagree completely, please let me know.  

Also, sorry for not seeing this recent pump opportunity, as it could have been identified due to the bounce from the bottom trending support, but I've missed it. 

Also if you look closely, there was another small scale (5%+) trade recently as a textbook  bullish pennant  presented itself (with a fake-out to the bottom before the break out to the upside).

TL:DR -  bullish  signs appear at strong support levels, a close above $490 would give me confidence this is not another bull trap.  Unfortunately  volume  is lacking to be confident in this positive price action.  I expect range bound trading for the next 6+ months. 

This is the  ETHUSD 1.10%  chart with 1D candles.  It's been a while since I have updated because until we break the short term dotted red downtrend line I don't see much room for  Ethereum 1.10%  to move higher.  Well in the last week we have seen promising signs of life.  Ether bounced off the psychological low of $400( ish             ) and didn't even come close to testing the possible  double bottom  level at $369.  This has set us up for a potential higher low which would be  bullish .   

With that being said I do not think we have definitively set a higher low.  Price is still well within the range of the dotted red downtrend line that has acted as resistance for the last 2 months.  It is promising that we have penetrated it but I would like to see a definitive close above it before calling that resistance line vanquished.  I would prefer a price a close at $490 or more, otherwise he may well see price decline again. 

At this point I am max invested in Ether and cannot take any more long positions although I would like to.  This does not mean price cannot go down as it certainly can.  I also do not think we are going to new All-Time-Highs anytime soon.  My expectation for the next 6 months is range bound trading with resistance at $730 and $800 and support at $400.

 Ethereum 1.14%  has added almost three percent in the past 24 hours. The currency pair develops its uptrend as the price moves along the  trend line . Our Wednesday targets were reached but ETH/USD failed to develop its progress and retreated towards the ascending  trend line . 

The currency pair touched the  resistance area  at $473.39 on Wednesday, but failed to jump over it and went downwards, targeting the ascending  trend line .  Ethereum 1.14%  is testing the resistance again in the moment of writing.  
We have a clear  bullish Hammer  pattern on the Hourly chart, which is confirmed by the fact that the currency pair jumped off the ascending  trend line . As for the targets for today, we think that  Ethereum 1.14%  is able to resume the uptrend. The first goal for the currency pair is to break through the  resistance area  at $473.39. 
The second (but the main) target lies higher at the next resistance at $500.36. As for  bearish  scenario it is less probable in this situation. Targets for sellers are the following: the price may reach the  support area  at $453.24 and if successful, it will go lower, targeting the next support at $431.42

As #bitcoin hit a recent lower low, we see  Ethereum 1.14%  almost revisiting the $400 price level, but did not break down from there quite yet. If we continue to hold the $400 area then maybe this could be a nice consideration for a longer term hold.

A quick update on  ETHUSD 1.14% . I've adjusted the  Gann Square  a bit making the arcs aligned with the lower points (point 1 and 3).  

Target 1: 260$, 23.July 
Target 2: 235$, 19.July  

My latest ideas on XRPUSD and  BTCUSD 0.41%  says the same dates.  

Here is why (along with my earlier arguments): 
- We are clearly in a descending trend currently (along the  gann  line). 
- A possible global descending  wedge  could appear (a bit early to confirm this!). 
- Target 1 is more likely compared to on how much I think  BTCUSD 0.41%  will fall.  
- Target 1 fits perfect to the bottom line of the descending  wedge .  
- Target 1 is also where the outer arc hits the fib circle.  
- Target 2 is my earlier target which I think also could fit, but less likely. 
- Target 2 is where the outer arc hits the global 1.27 fib level.  

Currently we're in a  rising wedge  which could indicate a drop ahead. It is important that the neckline (the red line) holds it down. 

Good luck!

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.41%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF -0.17%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

1) Trend analysis 
We have the  descending channel  of the downtrend 
We had the  rising channel  of the swing high 
And we've just established a new base channel 

2) Support and resistance 
We have tested 480 twice and failed both time, it's the LAST resistance on our way out of the downtrend 
We have confirmed 450 as a support, if this level break... Well... 

3) Candle patterns 
On the first break out attempt, we have a  shooting star  , visible on H4 
On the second a  hanging man  , visible on H1 
And on the daily we are seeing an  evening star  . 
The weekly is showing  bullish  signs, with a potential,  morning star  (daily) 

4) Indicators 
If we look at  BTC 0.41%  2.76% , there was a higher high, but  RSI  made a lower high, this is a negative sign 
ETH didn't make a new high at all, so  RSI  means nothing here 
Macd  has been failing to break higher since the first move up, as the arrow point 
CMF -0.17%  0.14% is more positive, on H4 it's been rising since yesterday low 

5)  Elliott Waves 
An easy EW count is the one on this chart BUT i don't like how  MACD  fell short of making a new high (and confirming this as a wave 3) 
A  bullish  alternative would be 3=i and 4=ii, we went down to fib 0.236 yesterday and that would work better with the indicators 
A  bearish  count would see 1 through 3 as a  leading diagonal 
An even more  bearish  count would see it as an  ABC 

5)  Demark Trendlines 
I only had upside target up to now, near 520 
But i'm starting to have targets to the downside 
Break out targets in orange 

6) Patterns 
Besides the inverted  head and shoulders  taht everyone must be talking about, all of the above hint to me to think of a triangle 
Watch  RSI  for it's confirmation, it should oscillate within those lines 

Conclusion : 
To remain  bullish  I would like to see a triangle (that would confirm the wave 3 theory) 
Or a breakout on the next daily candle, that would invalidate the  bearish  sign (and confirm this as a wave I & ii theory

if this keeps playing out as a triangle... just an idea tho

this guy that poked through the support is a bit of game changer, now price reached fib 0.3 of both moves. 
We could now be doing a shallower version of that triangle. 
We'll know if we touch the top instead of turning south at the orange target.

Well, his triangle is turning into a ugly little duckling :) 

Few things to be warry of : 
1) wave D could turn into a larger D' 
2) wave E probably won't touch my previous orange target (even E' wouldn't) 
3)I wouldn't be surprise if a quick candle were to overshoot everything and make a quick double bottom touch down, and that's like 2% (well 1.76%) below  target, so trade carefully 
4) This one is an advice : check on RSI or macd popping out of there own triangle, it usually anticipate what the price does and doesn't fakeout as easily
