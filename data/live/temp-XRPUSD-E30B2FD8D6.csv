1530249899.0,CryptoComes,XRP/USD Bulls Hold the Last Line,"
Ripple has lost more than four percent in the past 24 hours, but the currency pair remains neutral as it failed to establish new lows on Friday. The currency pair is above the descending  trend line , but is still unable to move higher. 
 When we look closer at the Hourly chart we can see that Ripple has tested the  resistance area  at $0.4744, but failed to jump over it and retreated later. Ripple has reached the  support area  at $0.4495 on Friday and is currently testing it. The possible ways for XRP/USD are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). Ripple will break through the support are at $0.4495 and develop its downside progress towards the next support at $0.4232.  
2.	Orange scenario (neutral). XRP/USD will stay above $0.4495 and fluctuate there, between this support and the resistance at $0.4744. We think that this scenario is the most likely for Friday.  
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). Ripple will cross the resistance are at $0.4744 and move higher targeting the next resistance at $0.4918.

Hey guys, 

This is the first idea I post. All of the indicators are showing there will be a reversal soon. Other than the indicators, its is pretty clear that tradingview's chat is extremely  bearish , and that is a major signal that things will turn around. Plus we have already crashed from 10k since the last bull run. If you think that the people who are manipulating this market will just let it crash instead of milking it all the way before it gets regulated, then youre gonna be buying my shitcoins at 8k because youre a sheep. 

I think that there will be a bear trap to aprox. 6500usd then bounce to the 8k resistance... However, i think that  BTC 0.68%  will eventually go back down to 3k or less.... 

Please share your thoughts. Constructive criticism is always welcome :) . 

Disclaimer: this is not trading/financial advice, just an idea.
