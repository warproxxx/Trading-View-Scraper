This is based on the Psychology Of A Market Cycle - Wall Street Cheat Sheet. 

This is not a prediction. 

Everytime I see a post with the cheat sheet next to  BTC              it is on the daily. The weekly chart seems to more accurately reflect the market cycle cheat sheet.

I wonder if this is a good place to anchor a low.

 BTC              forming a tightening range on the daily with a higher low trying to form to put us back in a tightening pattern.  
Remember the last time the bulls had any conviction with to start April and the bull move started after a daily equilibrium.  
Looking for  clear break Thursday or Friday. Bulls still have proving to do and the bears have favor in this pattern until then.  
Bulls still not seen two green days in a row in over a week.  
A bull break will put us right into daily  EMA  resistances, which will be a very key test for follow through.  
BTCUSDLONGS 1.97%  are increasing and shorts decreasing the last few days.  
Remaining patient and aware that when this break occurs, it will likely happen all at once and out of nowhere.  
This is a scenario where a trade could establish a starter position within the tight range and just keep a stop loss for a bear break.  
I do this when I dont want to have to chase and try and fill a full position on the way up.
