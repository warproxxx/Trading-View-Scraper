 BTC 1.32%  Is still in its wave 3. My TA still remains the same.. Until it doesn't. 
$7000 is still the real test. Until then we are continuing lower highs in a downward trend. 
I don't understand people asking me if they should buy now? If you wanna buy now why not buy at $5800? Why just the FOMO.. Its the 1 thing i am trying to teach everyone. 
Still finding resistance in the RED Cloud on the 6 hour. 
ill be watching closely over the weekend for the $7000 Mark and once we see what happens we can plan our next step. 
I do still think we will see sub 6000 and im sticking ti my plan. 
YES there are some decent alt trades over the last few days that we could have entered but im sticking to my strategy... 
we can make a load more monety once in an uo run is confirmed rather than gamble risky trades now. 
I do believe the end is coming but i also believe that there will be some more panic runs. 
Guys... BUY THE RED CANDLES... NOT THE GREEN ONES... DONT TRADE ON EMOTOINS... 
The reality is.. Were still down 20% from 1 month ago.. 
Be patient and we will update in a few days

We're currently fighting resistance around the 6800 level. For a  bullish  scenario we would like to hold the 6400 level on any pullback to help build momentum up for a possible push towards the 7400 level.. A close and open below the red line and we should expect the  bearish  pressure to continue.

The trend is your friend. The trend so far has been trade sideways and pole trade up. A possible wick around $7185 for large investors to close their longs and we come back down again finding support around $6,600-6500 before continuing further down. 

A break below $6450 would invalidate this.

ARE WE HEADING FOR A NEW LOW OR A TRIPPLE BOTTOM?........ The similar price move as depicted on the 4 hour chart could be pointing our attention to a possible new low, or a tripple bottom. 

Bears Holding up from here......chart looks  bearish  right now, a retest of the lower boundary is imminent from this point. 

Bearish  Divergence seen on the 4 hour time frame. 
RSI  nearing overbought and  STOCH  at upper extreme end. 
Rising wedge  formation and a gradually declining  volume  in the last 4 hours......(the  bearish  condition seems to have been spotted, thereby leading to a decreasing  volume ) 

A hoslistic view of the 4 hour chart shows that, there has been 5 successive  rising wedge  formation since Feb 2018.  
Out of the 5  rising wedge  formation, 3 has successively formed a new low on every break below it since April this year. 

However, an interesting point to note here is that the last low actually formed a  double bottom  at $5760 because the bulls defended that position and prevented price from falling below it. Are we seeing a new low from here, ow will the bulls defend the previous low again?

On the chart. Price is currently in the first supply area. Typically sellers will go short in supply areas. If successful you will see prices head back down. If not price will break through the supply area and continue upward to the next  supply zone . If price should head back down from zone 1 first before heading upward, this can act as a pullback before resuming it's path back up breaking through the first supply area and on to the next supply area. Here sellers again will try to dominate this area. Let's see how this turns out. Plan trades or long term investments carefully.

The trend is your friend. The trend so far has been trade sideways and pole trade up. A possible wick around $7185 for large investors to close their longs and we come back down again finding support around $6,600-6500 before continuing further down. 

A break below $6450 would invalidate this.

ARE WE HEADING FOR A NEW LOW OR A TRIPPLE BOTTOM?........ The similar price move as depicted on the 4 hour chart could be pointing our attention to a possible new low, or a tripple bottom. 

Bears Holding up from here......chart looks  bearish  right now, a retest of the lower boundary is imminent from this point. 

Bearish  Divergence seen on the 4 hour time frame. 
RSI  nearing overbought and  STOCH  at upper extreme end. 
Rising wedge  formation and a gradually declining  volume  in the last 4 hours......(the  bearish  condition seems to have been spotted, thereby leading to a decreasing  volume ) 

A hoslistic view of the 4 hour chart shows that, there has been 5 successive  rising wedge  formation since Feb 2018.  
Out of the 5  rising wedge  formation, 3 has successively formed a new low on every break below it since April this year. 

However, an interesting point to note here is that the last low actually formed a  double bottom  at $5760 because the bulls defended that position and prevented price from falling below it. Are we seeing a new low from here, ow will the bulls defend the previous low again?

On the chart. Price is currently in the first supply area. Typically sellers will go short in supply areas. If successful you will see prices head back down. If not price will break through the supply area and continue upward to the next  supply zone . If price should head back down from zone 1 first before heading upward, this can act as a pullback before resuming it's path back up breaking through the first supply area and on to the next supply area. Here sellers again will try to dominate this area. Let's see how this turns out. Plan trades or long term investments carefully.

 BTC 1.06%  Is still in its wave 3. My TA still remains the same.. Until it doesn't. 
$7000 is still the real test. Until then we are continuing lower highs in a downward trend. 
I don't understand people asking me if they should buy now? If you wanna buy now why not buy at $5800? Why just the FOMO.. Its the 1 thing i am trying to teach everyone. 
Still finding resistance in the RED Cloud on the 6 hour. 
ill be watching closely over the weekend for the $7000 Mark and once we see what happens we can plan our next step. 
I do still think we will see sub 6000 and im sticking ti my plan. 
YES there are some decent alt trades over the last few days that we could have entered but im sticking to my strategy... 
we can make a load more monety once in an uo run is confirmed rather than gamble risky trades now. 
I do believe the end is coming but i also believe that there will be some more panic runs. 
Guys... BUY THE RED CANDLES... NOT THE GREEN ONES... DONT TRADE ON EMOTOINS...

ARE WE HEADING FOR A NEW LOW OR A TRIPPLE BOTTOM?........ The similar price move as depicted on the 4 hour chart could be pointing our attention to a possible new low, or a tripple bottom.

Out of the 5  rising wedge  formation, 3 has successively formed a new low on every break below it since April this year. 

However, an interesting point to note here is that the last low actually formed a  double bottom  at $5760 because the bulls defended that position and prevented price from falling below it. Are we seeing a new low from here, ow will the bulls defend the previous low again?

On the chart. Price is currently in the first supply area. Typically sellers will go short in supply areas. If successful you will see prices head back down. If not price will break through the supply area and continue upward to the next  supply zone . If price should head back down from zone 1 first before heading upward, this can act as a pullback before resuming it's path back up breaking through the first supply area and on to the next supply area. Here sellers again will try to dominate this area. Let's see how this turns out. Plan trades or long term investments carefully.

 BTC 1.31%  Is still in its wave 3. My TA still remains the same.. Until it doesn't. 
$7000 is still the real test. Until then we are continuing lower highs in a downward trend. 
I don't understand people asking me if they should buy now? If you wanna buy now why not buy at $5800? Why just the FOMO.. Its the 1 thing i am trying to teach everyone. 
Still finding resistance in the RED Cloud on the 6 hour. 
ill be watching closely over the weekend for the $7000 Mark and once we see what happens we can plan our next step. 
I do still think we will see sub 6000 and im sticking ti my plan. 
YES there are some decent alt trades over the last few days that we could have entered but im sticking to my strategy... 
we can make a load more monety once in an uo run is confirmed rather than gamble risky trades now. 
I do believe the end is coming but i also believe that there will be some more panic runs.

We're currently fighting resistance around the 6800 level. For a  bullish  scenario we would like to hold the 6400 level on any pullback to help build momentum up for a possible push towards the 7400 level.. A close and open below the red line and we should expect the  bearish  pressure to continue.

On the chart. Price is currently in the first supply area. Typically sellers will go short in supply areas. If successful you will see prices head back down. If not price will break through the supply area and continue upward to the next  supply zone . If price should head back down from zone 1 first before heading upward, this can act as a pullback before resuming it's path back up breaking through the first supply area and on to the next supply area. Here sellers again will try to dominate this area. Let's see how this turns out. Plan trades or long term investments carefully.

 BTC 1.11%  Is still in its wave 3. My TA still remains the same.. Until it doesn't. 
$7000 is still the real test. Until then we are continuing lower highs in a downward trend. 
I don't understand people asking me if they should buy now? If you wanna buy now why not buy at $5800? Why just the FOMO.. Its the 1 thing i am trying to teach everyone. 
Still finding resistance in the RED Cloud on the 6 hour. 
ill be watching closely over the weekend for the $7000 Mark and once we see what happens we can plan our next step. 
I do still think we will see sub 6000 and im sticking ti my plan. 
YES there are some decent alt trades over the last few days that we could have entered but im sticking to my strategy... 
we can make a load more monety once in an uo run is confirmed rather than gamble risky trades now. 
I do believe the end is coming but i also believe that there will be some more panic runs. 
Guys... BUY THE RED CANDLES... NOT THE GREEN ONES... DONT TRADE ON EMOTOINS... 
The reality is.. Were still down 20% from 1 month ago..

We're currently fighting resistance around the 6800 level. For a  bullish  scenario we would like to hold the 6400 level on any pullback to help build momentum up for a possible push towards the 7400 level.. A close and open below the red line and we should expect the  bearish  pressure to continue.

The trend is your friend. The trend so far has been trade sideways and pole trade up. A possible wick around $7185 for large investors to close their longs and we come back down again finding support around $6,600-6500 before continuing further down. 

A break below $6450 would invalidate this.

ARE WE HEADING FOR A NEW LOW OR A TRIPPLE BOTTOM?........ The similar price move as depicted on the 4 hour chart could be pointing our attention to a possible new low, or a tripple bottom.

RSI  nearing overbought and  STOCH  at upper extreme end. 
Rising wedge  formation and a gradually declining  volume  in the last 4 hours......(the  bearish  condition seems to have been spotted, thereby leading to a decreasing  volume ) 

A hoslistic view of the 4 hour chart shows that, there has been 5 successive  rising wedge  formation since Feb 2018.  
Out of the 5  rising wedge  formation, 3 has successively formed a new low on every break below it since April this year. 

However, an interesting point to note here is that the last low actually formed a  double bottom  at $5760 because the bulls defended that position and prevented price from falling below it. Are we seeing a new low from here, ow will the bulls defend the previous low again?

$7000 is still the real test. Until then we are continuing lower highs in a downward trend.

Still finding resistance in the RED Cloud on the 6 hour. 
ill be watching closely over the weekend for the $7000 Mark and once we see what happens we can plan our next step.

YES there are some decent alt trades over the last few days that we could have entered but im sticking to my strategy... 
we can make a load more monety once in an uo run is confirmed rather than gamble risky trades now.

We're currently fighting resistance around the 6800 level. For a  bullish  scenario we would like to hold the 6400 level on any pullback to help build momentum up for a possible push towards the 7400 level.. A close and open below the red line and we should expect the  bearish  pressure to continue.

The trend is your friend. The trend so far has been trade sideways and pole trade up. A possible wick around $7185 for large investors to close their longs and we come back down again finding support around $6,600-6500 before continuing further down. 

A break below $6450 would invalidate this.

ARE WE HEADING FOR A NEW LOW OR A TRIPPLE BOTTOM?........ The similar price move as depicted on the 4 hour chart could be pointing our attention to a possible new low, or a tripple bottom. 

Bears Holding up from here......chart looks  bearish  right now, a retest of the lower boundary is imminent from this point. 

Bearish  Divergence seen on the 4 hour time frame. 
RSI  nearing overbought and  STOCH  at upper extreme end. 
Rising wedge  formation and a gradually declining  volume  in the last 4 hours......(the  bearish  condition seems to have been spotted, thereby leading to a decreasing  volume ) 

A hoslistic view of the 4 hour chart shows that, there has been 5 successive  rising wedge  formation since Feb 2018.  
Out of the 5  rising wedge  formation, 3 has successively formed a new low on every break below it since April this year. 

However, an interesting point to note here is that the last low actually formed a  double bottom  at $5760 because the bulls defended that position and prevented price from falling below it. Are we seeing a new low from here, ow will the bulls defend the previous low again?

On the chart. Price is currently in the first supply area. Typically sellers will go short in supply areas. If successful you will see prices head back down. If not price will break through the supply area and continue upward to the next  supply zone . If price should head back down from zone 1 first before heading upward, this can act as a pullback before resuming it's path back up breaking through the first supply area and on to the next supply area. Here sellers again will try to dominate this area. Let's see how this turns out. Plan trades or long term investments carefully.

The trend is your friend. The trend so far has been trade sideways and pole trade up. A possible wick around $7185 for large investors to close their longs and we come back down again finding support around $6,600-6500 before continuing further down. 

A break below $6450 would invalidate this.

ARE WE HEADING FOR A NEW LOW OR A TRIPPLE BOTTOM?........ The similar price move as depicted on the 4 hour chart could be pointing our attention to a possible new low, or a tripple bottom. 

Bears Holding up from here......chart looks  bearish  right now, a retest of the lower boundary is imminent from this point. 

Bearish  Divergence seen on the 4 hour time frame. 
RSI  nearing overbought and  STOCH  at upper extreme end. 
Rising wedge  formation and a gradually declining  volume  in the last 4 hours......(the  bearish  condition seems to have been spotted, thereby leading to a decreasing  volume ) 

A hoslistic view of the 4 hour chart shows that, there has been 5 successive  rising wedge  formation since Feb 2018.  
Out of the 5  rising wedge  formation, 3 has successively formed a new low on every break below it since April this year. 

However, an interesting point to note here is that the last low actually formed a  double bottom  at $5760 because the bulls defended that position and prevented price from falling below it. Are we seeing a new low from here, ow will the bulls defend the previous low again?

On the chart. Price is currently in the first supply area. Typically sellers will go short in supply areas. If successful you will see prices head back down. If not price will break through the supply area and continue upward to the next  supply zone . If price should head back down from zone 1 first before heading upward, this can act as a pullback before resuming it's path back up breaking through the first supply area and on to the next supply area. Here sellers again will try to dominate this area. Let's see how this turns out. Plan trades or long term investments carefully.

 BTC 0.92%  Is still in its wave 3. My TA still remains the same.. Until it doesn't. 
$7000 is still the real test. Until then we are continuing lower highs in a downward trend. 
I don't understand people asking me if they should buy now? If you wanna buy now why not buy at $5800? Why just the FOMO.. Its the 1 thing i am trying to teach everyone. 
Still finding resistance in the RED Cloud on the 6 hour. 
ill be watching closely over the weekend for the $7000 Mark and once we see what happens we can plan our next step. 
I do still think we will see sub 6000 and im sticking ti my plan. 
YES there are some decent alt trades over the last few days that we could have entered but im sticking to my strategy... 
we can make a load more monety once in an uo run is confirmed rather than gamble risky trades now. 
I do believe the end is coming but i also believe that there will be some more panic runs. 
Guys... BUY THE RED CANDLES... NOT THE GREEN ONES... DONT TRADE ON EMOTOINS...

We're currently fighting resistance around the 6800 level. For a  bullish  scenario we would like to hold the 6400 level on any pullback to help build momentum up for a possible push towards the 7400 level.. A close and open below the red line and we should expect the  bearish  pressure to continue.

ARE WE HEADING FOR A NEW LOW OR A TRIPPLE BOTTOM?........ The similar price move as depicted on the 4 hour chart could be pointing our attention to a possible new low, or a tripple bottom. 

Bears Holding up from here......chart looks  bearish  right now, a retest of the lower boundary is imminent from this point. 

Bearish  Divergence seen on the 4 hour time frame. 
RSI  nearing overbought and  STOCH  at upper extreme end. 
Rising wedge  formation and a gradually declining  volume  in the last 4 hours......(the  bearish  condition seems to have been spotted, thereby leading to a decreasing  volume ) 

A hoslistic view of the 4 hour chart shows that, there has been 5 successive  rising wedge  formation since Feb 2018.  
Out of the 5  rising wedge  formation, 3 has successively formed a new low on every break below it since April this year. 

However, an interesting point to note here is that the last low actually formed a  double bottom  at $5760 because the bulls defended that position and prevented price from falling below it. Are we seeing a new low from here, ow will the bulls defend the previous low again?

On the chart. Price is currently in the first supply area. Typically sellers will go short in supply areas. If successful you will see prices head back down. If not price will break through the supply area and continue upward to the next  supply zone . If price should head back down from zone 1 first before heading upward, this can act as a pullback before resuming it's path back up breaking through the first supply area and on to the next supply area. Here sellers again will try to dominate this area. Let's see how this turns out. Plan trades or long term investments carefully.

 BTC 1.16%  Is still in its wave 3. My TA still remains the same.. Until it doesn't. 
$7000 is still the real test. Until then we are continuing lower highs in a downward trend. 
I don't understand people asking me if they should buy now? If you wanna buy now why not buy at $5800? Why just the FOMO.. Its the 1 thing i am trying to teach everyone. 
Still finding resistance in the RED Cloud on the 6 hour. 
ill be watching closely over the weekend for the $7000 Mark and once we see what happens we can plan our next step. 
I do still think we will see sub 6000 and im sticking ti my plan. 
YES there are some decent alt trades over the last few days that we could have entered but im sticking to my strategy... 
we can make a load more monety once in an uo run is confirmed rather than gamble risky trades now. 
I do believe the end is coming but i also believe that there will be some more panic runs. 
Guys... BUY THE RED CANDLES... NOT THE GREEN ONES... DONT TRADE ON EMOTOINS...

We're currently fighting resistance around the 6800 level. For a  bullish  scenario we would like to hold the 6400 level on any pullback to help build momentum up for a possible push towards the 7400 level.. A close and open below the red line and we should expect the  bearish  pressure to continue.

The trend is your friend. The trend so far has been trade sideways and pole trade up. A possible wick around $7185 for large investors to close their longs and we come back down again finding support around $6,600-6500 before continuing further down. 

A break below $6450 would invalidate this.

On the chart. Price is currently in the first supply area. Typically sellers will go short in supply areas. If successful you will see prices head back down. If not price will break through the supply area and continue upward to the next  supply zone . If price should head back down from zone 1 first before heading upward, this can act as a pullback before resuming it's path back up breaking through the first supply area and on to the next supply area. Here sellers again will try to dominate this area. Let's see how this turns out. Plan trades or long term investments carefully.

 BTC 1.14%  Is still in its wave 3. My TA still remains the same.. Until it doesn't. 
$7000 is still the real test. Until then we are continuing lower highs in a downward trend. 
I don't understand people asking me if they should buy now? If you wanna buy now why not buy at $5800? Why just the FOMO.. Its the 1 thing i am trying to teach everyone. 
Still finding resistance in the RED Cloud on the 6 hour. 
ill be watching closely over the weekend for the $7000 Mark and once we see what happens we can plan our next step. 
I do still think we will see sub 6000 and im sticking ti my plan. 
YES there are some decent alt trades over the last few days that we could have entered but im sticking to my strategy... 
we can make a load more monety once in an uo run is confirmed rather than gamble risky trades now. 
I do believe the end is coming but i also believe that there will be some more panic runs. 
Guys... BUY THE RED CANDLES... NOT THE GREEN ONES... DONT TRADE ON EMOTOINS... 
The reality is.. Were still down 20% from 1 month ago..

We're currently fighting resistance around the 6800 level. For a  bullish  scenario we would like to hold the 6400 level on any pullback to help build momentum up for a possible push towards the 7400 level.. A close and open below the red line and we should expect the  bearish  pressure to continue.

The trend is your friend. The trend so far has been trade sideways and pole trade up. A possible wick around $7185 for large investors to close their longs and we come back down again finding support around $6,600-6500 before continuing further down. 

A break below $6450 would invalidate this.

ARE WE HEADING FOR A NEW LOW OR A TRIPPLE BOTTOM?........ The similar price move as depicted on the 4 hour chart could be pointing our attention to a possible new low, or a tripple bottom.

Bearish  Divergence seen on the 4 hour time frame. 
RSI  nearing overbought and  STOCH  at upper extreme end. 
Rising wedge  formation and a gradually declining  volume  in the last 4 hours......(the  bearish  condition seems to have been spotted, thereby leading to a decreasing  volume ) 

A hoslistic view of the 4 hour chart shows that, there has been 5 successive  rising wedge  formation since Feb 2018.  
Out of the 5  rising wedge  formation, 3 has successively formed a new low on every break below it since April this year. 

However, an interesting point to note here is that the last low actually formed a  double bottom  at $5760 because the bulls defended that position and prevented price from falling below it. Are we seeing a new low from here, ow will the bulls defend the previous low again?

The trend is your friend. The trend so far has been trade sideways and pole trade up. A possible wick around $7185 for large investors to close their longs and we come back down again finding support around $6,600-6500 before continuing further down. 

A break below $6450 would invalidate this.

ARE WE HEADING FOR A NEW LOW OR A TRIPPLE BOTTOM?........ The similar price move as depicted on the 4 hour chart could be pointing our attention to a possible new low, or a tripple bottom. 

Bears Holding up from here......chart looks  bearish  right now, a retest of the lower boundary is imminent from this point. 

Bearish  Divergence seen on the 4 hour time frame. 
RSI  nearing overbought and  STOCH  at upper extreme end. 
Rising wedge  formation and a gradually declining  volume  in the last 4 hours......(the  bearish  condition seems to have been spotted, thereby leading to a decreasing  volume ) 

A hoslistic view of the 4 hour chart shows that, there has been 5 successive  rising wedge  formation since Feb 2018.  
Out of the 5  rising wedge  formation, 3 has successively formed a new low on every break below it since April this year. 

However, an interesting point to note here is that the last low actually formed a  double bottom  at $5760 because the bulls defended that position and prevented price from falling below it. Are we seeing a new low from here, ow will the bulls defend the previous low again?

On the chart. Price is currently in the first supply area. Typically sellers will go short in supply areas. If successful you will see prices head back down. If not price will break through the supply area and continue upward to the next  supply zone . If price should head back down from zone 1 first before heading upward, this can act as a pullback before resuming it's path back up breaking through the first supply area and on to the next supply area. Here sellers again will try to dominate this area. Let's see how this turns out. Plan trades or long term investments carefully.

The trend is your friend. The trend so far has been trade sideways and pole trade up. A possible wick around $7185 for large investors to close their longs and we come back down again finding support around $6,600-6500 before continuing further down. 

A break below $6450 would invalidate this.

ARE WE HEADING FOR A NEW LOW OR A TRIPPLE BOTTOM?........ The similar price move as depicted on the 4 hour chart could be pointing our attention to a possible new low, or a tripple bottom. 

Bears Holding up from here......chart looks  bearish  right now, a retest of the lower boundary is imminent from this point. 

Bearish  Divergence seen on the 4 hour time frame. 
RSI  nearing overbought and  STOCH  at upper extreme end. 
Rising wedge  formation and a gradually declining  volume  in the last 4 hours......(the  bearish  condition seems to have been spotted, thereby leading to a decreasing  volume ) 

A hoslistic view of the 4 hour chart shows that, there has been 5 successive  rising wedge  formation since Feb 2018.  
Out of the 5  rising wedge  formation, 3 has successively formed a new low on every break below it since April this year. 

However, an interesting point to note here is that the last low actually formed a  double bottom  at $5760 because the bulls defended that position and prevented price from falling below it. Are we seeing a new low from here, ow will the bulls defend the previous low again?

On the chart. Price is currently in the first supply area. Typically sellers will go short in supply areas. If successful you will see prices head back down. If not price will break through the supply area and continue upward to the next  supply zone . If price should head back down from zone 1 first before heading upward, this can act as a pullback before resuming it's path back up breaking through the first supply area and on to the next supply area. Here sellers again will try to dominate this area. Let's see how this turns out. Plan trades or long term investments carefully.

 BTC 1.24%  Is still in its wave 3. My TA still remains the same.. Until it doesn't. 
$7000 is still the real test. Until then we are continuing lower highs in a downward trend. 
I don't understand people asking me if they should buy now? If you wanna buy now why not buy at $5800? Why just the FOMO.. Its the 1 thing i am trying to teach everyone. 
Still finding resistance in the RED Cloud on the 6 hour. 
ill be watching closely over the weekend for the $7000 Mark and once we see what happens we can plan our next step. 
I do still think we will see sub 6000 and im sticking ti my plan. 
YES there are some decent alt trades over the last few days that we could have entered but im sticking to my strategy... 
we can make a load more monety once in an uo run is confirmed rather than gamble risky trades now. 
I do believe the end is coming but i also believe that there will be some more panic runs. 
Guys... BUY THE RED CANDLES... NOT THE GREEN ONES... DONT TRADE ON EMOTOINS... 
The reality is.. Were still down 20% from 1 month ago.. 
Be patient and we will update in a few days

We're currently fighting resistance around the 6800 level. For a  bullish  scenario we would like to hold the 6400 level on any pullback to help build momentum up for a possible push towards the 7400 level.. A close and open below the red line and we should expect the  bearish  pressure to continue.

Bears Holding up from here......chart looks  bearish  right now, a retest of the lower boundary is imminent from this point. 

Bearish  Divergence seen on the 4 hour time frame. 
RSI  nearing overbought and  STOCH  at upper extreme end. 
Rising wedge  formation and a gradually declining  volume  in the last 4 hours......(the  bearish  condition seems to have been spotted, thereby leading to a decreasing  volume ) 

A hoslistic view of the 4 hour chart shows that, there has been 5 successive  rising wedge  formation since Feb 2018.  
Out of the 5  rising wedge  formation, 3 has successively formed a new low on every break below it since April this year. 

However, an interesting point to note here is that the last low actually formed a  double bottom  at $5760 because the bulls defended that position and prevented price from falling below it. Are we seeing a new low from here, ow will the bulls defend the previous low again?

On the chart. Price is currently in the first supply area. Typically sellers will go short in supply areas. If successful you will see prices head back down. If not price will break through the supply area and continue upward to the next  supply zone . If price should head back down from zone 1 first before heading upward, this can act as a pullback before resuming it's path back up breaking through the first supply area and on to the next supply area. Here sellers again will try to dominate this area. Let's see how this turns out. Plan trades or long term investments carefully.

 BTC 1.24%  Is still in its wave 3. My TA still remains the same.. Until it doesn't. 
$7000 is still the real test. Until then we are continuing lower highs in a downward trend. 
I don't understand people asking me if they should buy now? If you wanna buy now why not buy at $5800? Why just the FOMO.. Its the 1 thing i am trying to teach everyone. 
Still finding resistance in the RED Cloud on the 6 hour. 
ill be watching closely over the weekend for the $7000 Mark and once we see what happens we can plan our next step. 
I do still think we will see sub 6000 and im sticking ti my plan. 
YES there are some decent alt trades over the last few days that we could have entered but im sticking to my strategy... 
we can make a load more monety once in an uo run is confirmed rather than gamble risky trades now. 
I do believe the end is coming but i also believe that there will be some more panic runs. 
Guys... BUY THE RED CANDLES... NOT THE GREEN ONES... DONT TRADE ON EMOTOINS...

We're currently fighting resistance around the 6800 level. For a  bullish  scenario we would like to hold the 6400 level on any pullback to help build momentum up for a possible push towards the 7400 level.. A close and open below the red line and we should expect the  bearish  pressure to continue.

The trend is your friend. The trend so far has been trade sideways and pole trade up. A possible wick around $7185 for large investors to close their longs and we come back down again finding support around $6,600-6500 before continuing further down. 

A break below $6450 would invalidate this.

On the chart. Price is currently in the first supply area. Typically sellers will go short in supply areas. If successful you will see prices head back down. If not price will break through the supply area and continue upward to the next  supply zone . If price should head back down from zone 1 first before heading upward, this can act as a pullback before resuming it's path back up breaking through the first supply area and on to the next supply area. Here sellers again will try to dominate this area. Let's see how this turns out. Plan trades or long term investments carefully.

 BTC 1.02%  Is still in its wave 3. My TA still remains the same.. Until it doesn't. 
$7000 is still the real test. Until then we are continuing lower highs in a downward trend. 
I don't understand people asking me if they should buy now? If you wanna buy now why not buy at $5800? Why just the FOMO.. Its the 1 thing i am trying to teach everyone. 
Still finding resistance in the RED Cloud on the 6 hour. 
ill be watching closely over the weekend for the $7000 Mark and once we see what happens we can plan our next step. 
I do still think we will see sub 6000 and im sticking ti my plan. 
YES there are some decent alt trades over the last few days that we could have entered but im sticking to my strategy... 
we can make a load more monety once in an uo run is confirmed rather than gamble risky trades now. 
I do believe the end is coming but i also believe that there will be some more panic runs. 
Guys... BUY THE RED CANDLES... NOT THE GREEN ONES... DONT TRADE ON EMOTOINS... 
The reality is.. Were still down 20% from 1 month ago..

We're currently fighting resistance around the 6800 level. For a  bullish  scenario we would like to hold the 6400 level on any pullback to help build momentum up for a possible push towards the 7400 level.. A close and open below the red line and we should expect the  bearish  pressure to continue.

The trend is your friend. The trend so far has been trade sideways and pole trade up. A possible wick around $7185 for large investors to close their longs and we come back down again finding support around $6,600-6500 before continuing further down. 

A break below $6450 would invalidate this.

ARE WE HEADING FOR A NEW LOW OR A TRIPPLE BOTTOM?........ The similar price move as depicted on the 4 hour chart could be pointing our attention to a possible new low, or a tripple bottom.

Bearish  Divergence seen on the 4 hour time frame. 
RSI  nearing overbought and  STOCH  at upper extreme end. 
Rising wedge  formation and a gradually declining  volume  in the last 4 hours......(the  bearish  condition seems to have been spotted, thereby leading to a decreasing  volume ) 

A hoslistic view of the 4 hour chart shows that, there has been 5 successive  rising wedge  formation since Feb 2018.  
Out of the 5  rising wedge  formation, 3 has successively formed a new low on every break below it since April this year. 

However, an interesting point to note here is that the last low actually formed a  double bottom  at $5760 because the bulls defended that position and prevented price from falling below it. Are we seeing a new low from here, ow will the bulls defend the previous low again?

The trend is your friend. The trend so far has been trade sideways and pole trade up. A possible wick around $7185 for large investors to close their longs and we come back down again finding support around $6,600-6500 before continuing further down. 

A break below $6450 would invalidate this.

ARE WE HEADING FOR A NEW LOW OR A TRIPPLE BOTTOM?........ The similar price move as depicted on the 4 hour chart could be pointing our attention to a possible new low, or a tripple bottom. 

Bears Holding up from here......chart looks  bearish  right now, a retest of the lower boundary is imminent from this point. 

Bearish  Divergence seen on the 4 hour time frame. 
RSI  nearing overbought and  STOCH  at upper extreme end. 
Rising wedge  formation and a gradually declining  volume  in the last 4 hours......(the  bearish  condition seems to have been spotted, thereby leading to a decreasing  volume ) 

A hoslistic view of the 4 hour chart shows that, there has been 5 successive  rising wedge  formation since Feb 2018.  
Out of the 5  rising wedge  formation, 3 has successively formed a new low on every break below it since April this year. 

However, an interesting point to note here is that the last low actually formed a  double bottom  at $5760 because the bulls defended that position and prevented price from falling below it. Are we seeing a new low from here, ow will the bulls defend the previous low again?

On the chart. Price is currently in the first supply area. Typically sellers will go short in supply areas. If successful you will see prices head back down. If not price will break through the supply area and continue upward to the next  supply zone . If price should head back down from zone 1 first before heading upward, this can act as a pullback before resuming it's path back up breaking through the first supply area and on to the next supply area. Here sellers again will try to dominate this area. Let's see how this turns out. Plan trades or long term investments carefully.

 BTC 1.03%  Is still in its wave 3. My TA still remains the same.. Until it doesn't. 
$7000 is still the real test. Until then we are continuing lower highs in a downward trend. 
I don't understand people asking me if they should buy now? If you wanna buy now why not buy at $5800? Why just the FOMO.. Its the 1 thing i am trying to teach everyone. 
Still finding resistance in the RED Cloud on the 6 hour. 
ill be watching closely over the weekend for the $7000 Mark and once we see what happens we can plan our next step.

The trend is your friend. The trend so far has been trade sideways and pole trade up. A possible wick around $7185 for large investors to close their longs and we come back down again finding support around $6,600-6500 before continuing further down. 

A break below $6450 would invalidate this.

1530741189.0,Cryptoplush01,#BITCOIN: ARE WE HEADING FOR A NEW LOW OR A TRIPPLE BOTTOM?,"
ARE WE HEADING FOR A NEW LOW OR A TRIPPLE BOTTOM?........ The similar price move as depicted on the 4 hour chart could be pointing our attention to a possible new low, or a tripple bottom. 

Bears Holding up from here......chart looks  bearish  right now, a retest of the lower boundary is imminent from this point. 

Bearish  Divergence seen on the 4 hour time frame. 
RSI  nearing overbought and  STOCH  at upper extreme end. 
Rising wedge  formation and a gradually declining  volume  in the last 4 hours......(the  bearish  condition seems to have been spotted, thereby leading to a decreasing  volume ) 

A hoslistic view of the 4 hour chart shows that, there has been 5 successive  rising wedge  formation since Feb 2018.  
Out of the 5  rising wedge  formation, 3 has successively formed a new low on every break below it since April this year. 

However, an interesting point to note here is that the last low actually formed a  double bottom  at $5760 because the bulls defended that position and prevented price from falling below it. Are we seeing a new low from here, ow will the bulls defend the previous low again?

On the chart. Price is currently in the first supply area. Typically sellers will go short in supply areas. If successful you will see prices head back down. If not price will break through the supply area and continue upward to the next  supply zone . If price should head back down from zone 1 first before heading upward, this can act as a pullback before resuming it's path back up breaking through the first supply area and on to the next supply area. Here sellers again will try to dominate this area. Let's see how this turns out. Plan trades or long term investments carefully.

					Because yo have that nice long bar on the 10th of June 2018, there really is nothing to keep price from advancing upward now from current prices.
