1530047126.0,Elliottwave-Forecast,XRP/USD 4 Hour Elliott Wave Analysis,"
Hello Traders, 

In this analysis, we will have a look at XRP/USD in the 4-hour chart. 

Down from 04/24/18 peak, Ripple is showing an incomplete 5 swings sequence to the downside. 

Ripple completed the cycle from 04/24/18 in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5428). The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii -0.95% )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052). The internals of red wave A unfolded in a 5 waves  Elliott Wave  impulse, where it ended black wave ((i)) at the low of 06/05/18 (0.6338). Up from there, black wave ((ii)) correction was complete at 06/07/18 peak (0.6862). Below from there, it ended black wave (( iii -0.95% )) at the low of 06/10/18 (0.5553) and the correction in black wave ((iv)) at the peak of 06/11/18 (0.6038). Below from there, it finished black wave ((v)) of red wave A at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5045). From that low, it ended red wave B correction at the peak of 06/15/18 (0.5684). 

As long as bounces fail below 0.70 peak, then XRP will be looking to trade lower toward equal legs area 0.28 – 0.18 before ending a 7 swings double three structure. Up from there, it will be looking to bounce higher in 3 waves at least.

Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC -0.11%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO             , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term.

As expected, Ripple continued its calculated decline within the 1D Channel Down ( RSI  = 32.626, Highs/Lows = -0.0233, B/BP = -0.0848) as it broke the previous 4H  Rectangle . 4H is still neutral ( ADX ,  CCI , Highs/Lows) as it has been consolidating following the hit on a major target (0.46014) and  support level .

After trying to bring the XRP back to life - they met with the sellers. I am waiting for the breakdown of the triangle down and working out the tired on big timeframes. However, when breaking the triangle up - buyers are waiting for problems at 0.49-0.495 and at the price level of 0.51.

The rate of Ripple was in a lateral movement yesterday.  
Priority of the day: neutral position on XRPUSD. 
We are out of the market today, because it's too late to sell Ripple, and the reversal for its purchase has not come yet. 
We stuck today to our forecast of a small increase in the Ripple rate to $ 0.50. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.47 to $ 0.50. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will drop from $ 0.47 to $ 0.42. 
Alternative scenario: 
Our plans may be spoiled by another day of flat for the Ripple rate.

After trying to bring the XRP back to life - they met with the sellers. I am waiting for the breakdown of the triangle down and working out the tired on big timeframes. However, when breaking the triangle up - buyers are waiting for problems at 0.49-0.495 and at the price level of 0.51.

We are out of the market today, because it's too late to sell Ripple, and the reversal for its purchase has not come yet. 
We stuck today to our forecast of a small increase in the Ripple rate to $ 0.50. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.47 to $ 0.50. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will drop from $ 0.47 to $ 0.42.

1530047126.0,Elliottwave-Forecast,XRP/USD 4 Hour Elliott Wave Analysis,"
Hello Traders, 

In this analysis, we will have a look at XRP/USD in the 4-hour chart. 

Down from 04/24/18 peak, Ripple is showing an incomplete 5 swings sequence to the downside. 

Ripple completed the cycle from 04/24/18 in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5428). The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii             )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052). The internals of red wave A unfolded in a 5 waves  Elliott Wave  impulse, where it ended black wave ((i)) at the low of 06/05/18 (0.6338). Up from there, black wave ((ii)) correction was complete at 06/07/18 peak (0.6862). Below from there, it ended black wave (( iii             )) at the low of 06/10/18 (0.5553) and the correction in black wave ((iv)) at the peak of 06/11/18 (0.6038). Below from there, it finished black wave ((v)) of red wave A at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5045). From that low, it ended red wave B correction at the peak of 06/15/18 (0.5684). 

As long as bounces fail below 0.70 peak, then XRP will be looking to trade lower toward equal legs area 0.28 – 0.18 before ending a 7 swings double three structure. Up from there, it will be looking to bounce higher in 3 waves at least.

1530021929.0,Exsilium,$XRP #Ripple - Near Term Bottom Sill In Play - Still Bullish,"
Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC -0.11%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO 0.00% , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term.

As always, this is my personal observation and analysis of the market and is not intended to be trading advice.

As expected, Ripple continued its calculated decline within the 1D Channel Down ( RSI  = 32.626, Highs/Lows = -0.0233, B/BP = -0.0848) as it broke the previous 4H  Rectangle . 4H is still neutral ( ADX ,  CCI , Highs/Lows) as it has been consolidating following the hit on a major target (0.46014) and  support level . Our TP remains 0.4000. XRPUSD will eventually break the intermediate line (red dotted) and make an even more aggressive Lower Low = 0.35277 on the 1D Channel Down as the 1W selling pressure is greater than previously (Highs/Lows = -0.0869).

After trying to bring the XRP back to life - they met with the sellers. I am waiting for the breakdown of the triangle down and working out the tired on big timeframes. However, when breaking the triangle up - buyers are waiting for problems at 0.49-0.495 and at the price level of 0.51.

The rate of Ripple was in a lateral movement yesterday.  
Priority of the day: neutral position on XRPUSD. 
We are out of the market today, because it's too late to sell Ripple, and the reversal for its purchase has not come yet. 
We stuck today to our forecast of a small increase in the Ripple rate to $ 0.50. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.47 to $ 0.50. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will drop from $ 0.47 to $ 0.42.

1530047126.0,Elliottwave-Forecast,XRP/USD 4 Hour Elliott Wave Analysis,"
Hello Traders, 

In this analysis, we will have a look at XRP/USD in the 4-hour chart. 

Down from 04/24/18 peak, Ripple is showing an incomplete 5 swings sequence to the downside. 

Ripple completed the cycle from 04/24/18 in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5428). The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii -0.65% )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052). The internals of red wave A unfolded in a 5 waves  Elliott Wave  impulse, where it ended black wave ((i)) at the low of 06/05/18 (0.6338). Up from there, black wave ((ii)) correction was complete at 06/07/18 peak (0.6862). Below from there, it ended black wave (( iii -0.65% )) at the low of 06/10/18 (0.5553) and the correction in black wave ((iv)) at the peak of 06/11/18 (0.6038). Below from there, it finished black wave ((v)) of red wave A at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5045). From that low, it ended red wave B correction at the peak of 06/15/18 (0.5684). 

As long as bounces fail below 0.70 peak, then XRP will be looking to trade lower toward equal legs area 0.28 – 0.18 before ending a 7 swings double three structure. Up from there, it will be looking to bounce higher in 3 waves at least.

1530021929.0,Exsilium,$XRP #Ripple - Near Term Bottom Sill In Play - Still Bullish,"
Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC -0.03%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO 0.00% , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term.

As long as bounces fail below 0.70 peak, then XRP will be looking to trade lower toward equal legs area 0.28 – 0.18 before ending a 7 swings double three structure. Up from there, it will be looking to bounce higher in 3 waves at least.

Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC -0.03%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO 0.00% , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term.

The rate of Ripple was in a lateral movement yesterday.  
Priority of the day: neutral position on XRPUSD. 
We are out of the market today, because it's too late to sell Ripple, and the reversal for its purchase has not come yet. 
We stuck today to our forecast of a small increase in the Ripple rate to $ 0.50. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.47 to $ 0.50. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will drop from $ 0.47 to $ 0.42.

Hello Traders, 

In this analysis, we will have a look at XRP/USD in the 4-hour chart. 

Down from 04/24/18 peak, Ripple is showing an incomplete 5 swings sequence to the downside. 

Ripple completed the cycle from 04/24/18 in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5428). The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii -0.65% )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052). The internals of red wave A unfolded in a 5 waves  Elliott Wave  impulse, where it ended black wave ((i)) at the low of 06/05/18 (0.6338).

1530047126.0,Elliottwave-Forecast,XRP/USD 4 Hour Elliott Wave Analysis,"
Hello Traders, 

In this analysis, we will have a look at XRP/USD in the 4-hour chart. 

Down from 04/24/18 peak, Ripple is showing an incomplete 5 swings sequence to the downside. 

Ripple completed the cycle from 04/24/18 in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5428). The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii -1.00% )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052). The internals of red wave A unfolded in a 5 waves  Elliott Wave  impulse, where it ended black wave ((i)) at the low of 06/05/18 (0.6338). Up from there, black wave ((ii)) correction was complete at 06/07/18 peak (0.6862). Below from there, it ended black wave (( iii -1.00% )) at the low of 06/10/18 (0.5553) and the correction in black wave ((iv)) at the peak of 06/11/18 (0.6038). Below from there, it finished black wave ((v)) of red wave A at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5045). From that low, it ended red wave B correction at the peak of 06/15/18 (0.5684). 

As long as bounces fail below 0.70 peak, then XRP will be looking to trade lower toward equal legs area 0.28 – 0.18 before ending a 7 swings double three structure. Up from there, it will be looking to bounce higher in 3 waves at least.

Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC -0.01%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO 0.00% , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term.

After trying to bring the XRP back to life - they met with the sellers. I am waiting for the breakdown of the triangle down and working out the tired on big timeframes. However, when breaking the triangle up - buyers are waiting for problems at 0.49-0.495 and at the price level of 0.51.

The rate of Ripple was in a lateral movement yesterday.  
Priority of the day: neutral position on XRPUSD. 
We are out of the market today, because it's too late to sell Ripple, and the reversal for its purchase has not come yet. 
We stuck today to our forecast of a small increase in the Ripple rate to $ 0.50. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.47 to $ 0.50. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will drop from $ 0.47 to $ 0.42. 
Alternative scenario:

After trying to bring the XRP back to life - they met with the sellers. I am waiting for the breakdown of the triangle down and working out the tired on big timeframes. However, when breaking the triangle up - buyers are waiting for problems at 0.49-0.495 and at the price level of 0.51.

The rate of Ripple was in a lateral movement yesterday.  
Priority of the day: neutral position on XRPUSD. 
We are out of the market today, because it's too late to sell Ripple, and the reversal for its purchase has not come yet. 
We stuck today to our forecast of a small increase in the Ripple rate to $ 0.50. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.47 to $ 0.50. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will drop from $ 0.47 to $ 0.42. 
Alternative scenario: 
Our plans may be spoiled by another day of flat for the Ripple rate.

1530047126.0,Elliottwave-Forecast,XRP/USD 4 Hour Elliott Wave Analysis,"
Hello Traders, 

In this analysis, we will have a look at XRP/USD in the 4-hour chart. 

Down from 04/24/18 peak, Ripple is showing an incomplete 5 swings sequence to the downside. 

Ripple completed the cycle from 04/24/18 in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5428). The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii             )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052). The internals of red wave A unfolded in a 5 waves  Elliott Wave  impulse, where it ended black wave ((i)) at the low of 06/05/18 (0.6338). Up from there, black wave ((ii)) correction was complete at 06/07/18 peak (0.6862). Below from there, it ended black wave (( iii             )) at the low of 06/10/18 (0.5553) and the correction in black wave ((iv)) at the peak of 06/11/18 (0.6038). Below from there, it finished black wave ((v)) of red wave A at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5045). From that low, it ended red wave B correction at the peak of 06/15/18 (0.5684). 

As long as bounces fail below 0.70 peak, then XRP will be looking to trade lower toward equal legs area 0.28 – 0.18 before ending a 7 swings double three structure. Up from there, it will be looking to bounce higher in 3 waves at least.

1530021929.0,Exsilium,$XRP #Ripple - Near Term Bottom Sill In Play - Still Bullish,"
Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC 0.02%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO             , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term.

As always, this is my personal observation and analysis of the market and is not intended to be trading advice.

As expected, Ripple continued its calculated decline within the 1D Channel Down ( RSI  = 32.626, Highs/Lows = -0.0233, B/BP = -0.0848) as it broke the previous 4H  Rectangle . 4H is still neutral ( ADX ,  CCI , Highs/Lows) as it has been consolidating following the hit on a major target (0.46014) and  support level . Our TP remains 0.4000. XRPUSD will eventually break the intermediate line (red dotted) and make an even more aggressive Lower Low = 0.35277 on the 1D Channel Down as the 1W selling pressure is greater than previously (Highs/Lows = -0.0869).

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC 0.01%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO 0.00% , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term.

After trying to bring the XRP back to life - they met with the sellers. I am waiting for the breakdown of the triangle down and working out the tired on big timeframes. However, when breaking the triangle up - buyers are waiting for problems at 0.49-0.495 and at the price level of 0.51.

The rate of Ripple was in a lateral movement yesterday.  
Priority of the day: neutral position on XRPUSD. 
We are out of the market today, because it's too late to sell Ripple, and the reversal for its purchase has not come yet. 
We stuck today to our forecast of a small increase in the Ripple rate to $ 0.50. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.47 to $ 0.50. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will drop from $ 0.47 to $ 0.42.

1530047126.0,Elliottwave-Forecast,XRP/USD 4 Hour Elliott Wave Analysis,"
Hello Traders, 

In this analysis, we will have a look at XRP/USD in the 4-hour chart. 

Down from 04/24/18 peak, Ripple is showing an incomplete 5 swings sequence to the downside. 

Ripple completed the cycle from 04/24/18 in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5428). The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii -0.64% )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052). The internals of red wave A unfolded in a 5 waves  Elliott Wave  impulse, where it ended black wave ((i)) at the low of 06/05/18 (0.6338). Up from there, black wave ((ii)) correction was complete at 06/07/18 peak (0.6862). Below from there, it ended black wave (( iii -0.64% )) at the low of 06/10/18 (0.5553) and the correction in black wave ((iv)) at the peak of 06/11/18 (0.6038). Below from there, it finished black wave ((v)) of red wave A at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5045). From that low, it ended red wave B correction at the peak of 06/15/18 (0.5684). 

As long as bounces fail below 0.70 peak, then XRP will be looking to trade lower toward equal legs area 0.28 – 0.18 before ending a 7 swings double three structure. Up from there, it will be looking to bounce higher in 3 waves at least.

Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation.

Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC 0.08%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO 0.00% , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term.

We are out of the market today, because it's too late to sell Ripple, and the reversal for its purchase has not come yet. 
We stuck today to our forecast of a small increase in the Ripple rate to $ 0.50. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.47 to $ 0.50.

Hello Traders, 

In this analysis, we will have a look at XRP/USD in the 4-hour chart. 

Down from 04/24/18 peak, Ripple is showing an incomplete 5 swings sequence to the downside. 

Ripple completed the cycle from 04/24/18 in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5428). The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii             )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052).

Hello Traders, 

In this analysis, we will have a look at XRP/USD in the 4-hour chart. 

Down from 04/24/18 peak, Ripple is showing an incomplete 5 swings sequence to the downside. 

Ripple completed the cycle from 04/24/18 in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5428). The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii -0.50% )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052). The internals of red wave A unfolded in a 5 waves  Elliott Wave  impulse, where it ended black wave ((i)) at the low of 06/05/18 (0.6338). Up from there, black wave ((ii)) correction was complete at 06/07/18 peak (0.6862). Below from there, it ended black wave (( iii -0.50% )) at the low of 06/10/18 (0.5553) and the correction in black wave ((iv)) at the peak of 06/11/18 (0.6038). Below from there, it finished black wave ((v)) of red wave A at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5045). From that low, it ended red wave B correction at the peak of 06/15/18 (0.5684). 

As long as bounces fail below 0.70 peak, then XRP will be looking to trade lower toward equal legs area 0.28 – 0.18 before ending a 7 swings double three structure. Up from there, it will be looking to bounce higher in 3 waves at least.

Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC 0.08%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO 0.00% , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term.

As expected, Ripple continued its calculated decline within the 1D Channel Down ( RSI  = 32.626, Highs/Lows = -0.0233, B/BP = -0.0848) as it broke the previous 4H  Rectangle . 4H is still neutral ( ADX ,  CCI , Highs/Lows) as it has been consolidating following the hit on a major target (0.46014) and  support level .

After trying to bring the XRP back to life - they met with the sellers. I am waiting for the breakdown of the triangle down and working out the tired on big timeframes. However, when breaking the triangle up - buyers are waiting for problems at 0.49-0.495 and at the price level of 0.51.

The rate of Ripple was in a lateral movement yesterday.  
Priority of the day: neutral position on XRPUSD. 
We are out of the market today, because it's too late to sell Ripple, and the reversal for its purchase has not come yet. 
We stuck today to our forecast of a small increase in the Ripple rate to $ 0.50. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.47 to $ 0.50. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will drop from $ 0.47 to $ 0.42. 
Alternative scenario: 
Our plans may be spoiled by another day of flat for the Ripple rate.

After trying to bring the XRP back to life - they met with the sellers. I am waiting for the breakdown of the triangle down and working out the tired on big timeframes. However, when breaking the triangle up - buyers are waiting for problems at 0.49-0.495 and at the price level of 0.51.

The rate of Ripple was in a lateral movement yesterday.  
Priority of the day: neutral position on XRPUSD. 
We are out of the market today, because it's too late to sell Ripple, and the reversal for its purchase has not come yet. 
We stuck today to our forecast of a small increase in the Ripple rate to $ 0.50. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.47 to $ 0.50. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will drop from $ 0.47 to $ 0.42. 
Alternative scenario:

1530047126.0,Elliottwave-Forecast,XRP/USD 4 Hour Elliott Wave Analysis,"
Hello Traders, 

In this analysis, we will have a look at XRP/USD in the 4-hour chart. 

Down from 04/24/18 peak, Ripple is showing an incomplete 5 swings sequence to the downside. 

Ripple completed the cycle from 04/24/18 in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5428). The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii -0.71% )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052). The internals of red wave A unfolded in a 5 waves  Elliott Wave  impulse, where it ended black wave ((i)) at the low of 06/05/18 (0.6338). Up from there, black wave ((ii)) correction was complete at 06/07/18 peak (0.6862). Below from there, it ended black wave (( iii -0.71% )) at the low of 06/10/18 (0.5553) and the correction in black wave ((iv)) at the peak of 06/11/18 (0.6038). Below from there, it finished black wave ((v)) of red wave A at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5045). From that low, it ended red wave B correction at the peak of 06/15/18 (0.5684). 

As long as bounces fail below 0.70 peak, then XRP will be looking to trade lower toward equal legs area 0.28 – 0.18 before ending a 7 swings double three structure. Up from there, it will be looking to bounce higher in 3 waves at least.

1530021929.0,Exsilium,$XRP #Ripple - Near Term Bottom Sill In Play - Still Bullish,"
Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC              gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO             , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term. 

=========== 

As always, this is my personal observation and analysis of the market and is not intended to be trading advice.

As expected, Ripple continued its calculated decline within the 1D Channel Down ( RSI  = 32.626, Highs/Lows = -0.0233, B/BP = -0.0848) as it broke the previous 4H  Rectangle . 4H is still neutral ( ADX ,  CCI , Highs/Lows) as it has been consolidating following the hit on a major target (0.46014) and  support level . Our TP remains 0.4000. XRPUSD will eventually break the intermediate line (red dotted) and make an even more aggressive Lower Low = 0.35277 on the 1D Channel Down as the 1W selling pressure is greater than previously (Highs/Lows = -0.0869).

Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC 0.09%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO 0.00% , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term.

After trying to bring the XRP back to life - they met with the sellers. I am waiting for the breakdown of the triangle down and working out the tired on big timeframes. However, when breaking the triangle up - buyers are waiting for problems at 0.49-0.495 and at the price level of 0.51.

The rate of Ripple was in a lateral movement yesterday.  
Priority of the day: neutral position on XRPUSD. 
We are out of the market today, because it's too late to sell Ripple, and the reversal for its purchase has not come yet. 
We stuck today to our forecast of a small increase in the Ripple rate to $ 0.50. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.47 to $ 0.50. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will drop from $ 0.47 to $ 0.42.

1530047126.0,Elliottwave-Forecast,XRP/USD 4 Hour Elliott Wave Analysis,"
Hello Traders, 

In this analysis, we will have a look at XRP/USD in the 4-hour chart. 

Down from 04/24/18 peak, Ripple is showing an incomplete 5 swings sequence to the downside. 

Ripple completed the cycle from 04/24/18 in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5428). The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii -1.12% )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052). The internals of red wave A unfolded in a 5 waves  Elliott Wave  impulse, where it ended black wave ((i)) at the low of 06/05/18 (0.6338). Up from there, black wave ((ii)) correction was complete at 06/07/18 peak (0.6862). Below from there, it ended black wave (( iii -1.12% )) at the low of 06/10/18 (0.5553) and the correction in black wave ((iv)) at the peak of 06/11/18 (0.6038). Below from there, it finished black wave ((v)) of red wave A at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5045). From that low, it ended red wave B correction at the peak of 06/15/18 (0.5684). 

As long as bounces fail below 0.70 peak, then XRP will be looking to trade lower toward equal legs area 0.28 – 0.18 before ending a 7 swings double three structure. Up from there, it will be looking to bounce higher in 3 waves at least.

The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii -0.79% )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052). The internals of red wave A unfolded in a 5 waves  Elliott Wave  impulse, where it ended black wave ((i)) at the low of 06/05/18 (0.6338). Up from there, black wave ((ii)) correction was complete at 06/07/18 peak (0.6862). Below from there, it ended black wave (( iii -0.79% )) at the low of 06/10/18 (0.5553) and the correction in black wave ((iv)) at the peak of 06/11/18 (0.6038). Below from there, it finished black wave ((v)) of red wave A at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5045). From that low, it ended red wave B correction at the peak of 06/15/18 (0.5684). 

As long as bounces fail below 0.70 peak, then XRP will be looking to trade lower toward equal legs area 0.28 – 0.18 before ending a 7 swings double three structure. Up from there, it will be looking to bounce higher in 3 waves at least.

Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC 0.09%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO             , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term.

The rate of Ripple was in a lateral movement yesterday.  
Priority of the day: neutral position on XRPUSD. 
We are out of the market today, because it's too late to sell Ripple, and the reversal for its purchase has not come yet. 
We stuck today to our forecast of a small increase in the Ripple rate to $ 0.50. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.47 to $ 0.50. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will drop from $ 0.47 to $ 0.42.

We stuck today to our forecast of a small increase in the Ripple rate to $ 0.50. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.47 to $ 0.50. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will drop from $ 0.47 to $ 0.42. 
Alternative scenario: 
Our plans may be spoiled by another day of flat for the Ripple rate.

Hello Traders, 

In this analysis, we will have a look at XRP/USD in the 4-hour chart. 

Down from 04/24/18 peak, Ripple is showing an incomplete 5 swings sequence to the downside. 

Ripple completed the cycle from 04/24/18 in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5428). The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii -0.81% )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052). The internals of red wave A unfolded in a 5 waves  Elliott Wave  impulse, where it ended black wave ((i)) at the low of 06/05/18 (0.6338). Up from there, black wave ((ii)) correction was complete at 06/07/18 peak (0.6862). Below from there, it ended black wave (( iii -0.81% )) at the low of 06/10/18 (0.5553) and the correction in black wave ((iv)) at the peak of 06/11/18 (0.6038). Below from there, it finished black wave ((v)) of red wave A at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5045). From that low, it ended red wave B correction at the peak of 06/15/18 (0.5684). 

As long as bounces fail below 0.70 peak, then XRP will be looking to trade lower toward equal legs area 0.28 – 0.18 before ending a 7 swings double three structure. Up from there, it will be looking to bounce higher in 3 waves at least.

Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC 0.09%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO 0.00% , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term.

As expected, Ripple continued its calculated decline within the 1D Channel Down ( RSI  = 32.626, Highs/Lows = -0.0233, B/BP = -0.0848) as it broke the previous 4H  Rectangle . 4H is still neutral ( ADX ,  CCI , Highs/Lows) as it has been consolidating following the hit on a major target (0.46014) and  support level .

After trying to bring the XRP back to life - they met with the sellers. I am waiting for the breakdown of the triangle down and working out the tired on big timeframes. However, when breaking the triangle up - buyers are waiting for problems at 0.49-0.495 and at the price level of 0.51.

After trying to bring the XRP back to life - they met with the sellers. I am waiting for the breakdown of the triangle down and working out the tired on big timeframes. However, when breaking the triangle up - buyers are waiting for problems at 0.49-0.495 and at the price level of 0.51.

The rate of Ripple was in a lateral movement yesterday.  
Priority of the day: neutral position on XRPUSD. 
We are out of the market today, because it's too late to sell Ripple, and the reversal for its purchase has not come yet. 
We stuck today to our forecast of a small increase in the Ripple rate to $ 0.50. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.47 to $ 0.50. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will drop from $ 0.47 to $ 0.42. 
Alternative scenario:

1530047126.0,Elliottwave-Forecast,XRP/USD 4 Hour Elliott Wave Analysis,"
Hello Traders, 

In this analysis, we will have a look at XRP/USD in the 4-hour chart. 

Down from 04/24/18 peak, Ripple is showing an incomplete 5 swings sequence to the downside. 

Ripple completed the cycle from 04/24/18 in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5428). The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii -0.63% )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052). The internals of red wave A unfolded in a 5 waves  Elliott Wave  impulse, where it ended black wave ((i)) at the low of 06/05/18 (0.6338). Up from there, black wave ((ii)) correction was complete at 06/07/18 peak (0.6862). Below from there, it ended black wave (( iii -0.63% )) at the low of 06/10/18 (0.5553) and the correction in black wave ((iv)) at the peak of 06/11/18 (0.6038). Below from there, it finished black wave ((v)) of red wave A at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5045). From that low, it ended red wave B correction at the peak of 06/15/18 (0.5684). 

As long as bounces fail below 0.70 peak, then XRP will be looking to trade lower toward equal legs area 0.28 – 0.18 before ending a 7 swings double three structure. Up from there, it will be looking to bounce higher in 3 waves at least.

1530021929.0,Exsilium,$XRP #Ripple - Near Term Bottom Sill In Play - Still Bullish,"
Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC 0.19%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO 0.00% , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term.

As always, this is my personal observation and analysis of the market and is not intended to be trading advice.

Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC 0.09%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO 0.00% , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term.

The rate of Ripple was in a lateral movement yesterday.  
Priority of the day: neutral position on XRPUSD. 
We are out of the market today, because it's too late to sell Ripple, and the reversal for its purchase has not come yet. 
We stuck today to our forecast of a small increase in the Ripple rate to $ 0.50. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.47 to $ 0.50. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will drop from $ 0.47 to $ 0.42.

Hello Traders, 

In this analysis, we will have a look at XRP/USD in the 4-hour chart. 

Down from 04/24/18 peak, Ripple is showing an incomplete 5 swings sequence to the downside. 

Ripple completed the cycle from 04/24/18 in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5428). The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii -1.13% )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052). The internals of red wave A unfolded in a 5 waves  Elliott Wave  impulse, where it ended black wave ((i)) at the low of 06/05/18 (0.6338). Up from there, black wave ((ii)) correction was complete at 06/07/18 peak (0.6862). Below from there, it ended black wave (( iii -1.13% )) at the low of 06/10/18 (0.5553) and the correction in black wave ((iv)) at the peak of 06/11/18 (0.6038). Below from there, it finished black wave ((v)) of red wave A at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5045). From that low, it ended red wave B correction at the peak of 06/15/18 (0.5684).

Hello Traders, 

In this analysis, we will have a look at XRP/USD in the 4-hour chart. 

Down from 04/24/18 peak, Ripple is showing an incomplete 5 swings sequence to the downside. 

Ripple completed the cycle from 04/24/18 in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5428). The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii -0.82% )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052). The internals of red wave A unfolded in a 5 waves  Elliott Wave  impulse, where it ended black wave ((i)) at the low of 06/05/18 (0.6338). Up from there, black wave ((ii)) correction was complete at 06/07/18 peak (0.6862). Below from there, it ended black wave (( iii -0.82% )) at the low of 06/10/18 (0.5553) and the correction in black wave ((iv)) at the peak of 06/11/18 (0.6038). Below from there, it finished black wave ((v)) of red wave A at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5045). From that low, it ended red wave B correction at the peak of 06/15/18 (0.5684). 

As long as bounces fail below 0.70 peak, then XRP will be looking to trade lower toward equal legs area 0.28 – 0.18 before ending a 7 swings double three structure. Up from there, it will be looking to bounce higher in 3 waves at least.

Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC 0.10%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO 0.00% , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term.

After trying to bring the XRP back to life - they met with the sellers. I am waiting for the breakdown of the triangle down and working out the tired on big timeframes. However, when breaking the triangle up - buyers are waiting for problems at 0.49-0.495 and at the price level of 0.51.

The rate of Ripple was in a lateral movement yesterday.  
Priority of the day: neutral position on XRPUSD. 
We are out of the market today, because it's too late to sell Ripple, and the reversal for its purchase has not come yet. 
We stuck today to our forecast of a small increase in the Ripple rate to $ 0.50. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.47 to $ 0.50. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will drop from $ 0.47 to $ 0.42. 
Alternative scenario:

After trying to bring the XRP back to life - they met with the sellers. I am waiting for the breakdown of the triangle down and working out the tired on big timeframes. However, when breaking the triangle up - buyers are waiting for problems at 0.49-0.495 and at the price level of 0.51.

The rate of Ripple was in a lateral movement yesterday.  
Priority of the day: neutral position on XRPUSD. 
We are out of the market today, because it's too late to sell Ripple, and the reversal for its purchase has not come yet. 
We stuck today to our forecast of a small increase in the Ripple rate to $ 0.50. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.47 to $ 0.50. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will drop from $ 0.47 to $ 0.42. 
Alternative scenario: 
Our plans may be spoiled by another day of flat for the Ripple rate.

1530047126.0,Elliottwave-Forecast,XRP/USD 4 Hour Elliott Wave Analysis,"
Hello Traders, 

In this analysis, we will have a look at XRP/USD in the 4-hour chart. 

Down from 04/24/18 peak, Ripple is showing an incomplete 5 swings sequence to the downside. 

Ripple completed the cycle from 04/24/18 in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5428). The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii -1.23% )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052). The internals of red wave A unfolded in a 5 waves  Elliott Wave  impulse, where it ended black wave ((i)) at the low of 06/05/18 (0.6338). Up from there, black wave ((ii)) correction was complete at 06/07/18 peak (0.6862). Below from there, it ended black wave (( iii -1.23% )) at the low of 06/10/18 (0.5553) and the correction in black wave ((iv)) at the peak of 06/11/18 (0.6038). Below from there, it finished black wave ((v)) of red wave A at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5045). From that low, it ended red wave B correction at the peak of 06/15/18 (0.5684). 

As long as bounces fail below 0.70 peak, then XRP will be looking to trade lower toward equal legs area 0.28 – 0.18 before ending a 7 swings double three structure. Up from there, it will be looking to bounce higher in 3 waves at least.

1530021929.0,Exsilium,$XRP #Ripple - Near Term Bottom Sill In Play - Still Bullish,"
Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC 0.00%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO 0.00% , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term.

As always, this is my personal observation and analysis of the market and is not intended to be trading advice.

As expected, Ripple continued its calculated decline within the 1D Channel Down ( RSI  = 32.626, Highs/Lows = -0.0233, B/BP = -0.0848) as it broke the previous 4H  Rectangle . 4H is still neutral ( ADX ,  CCI , Highs/Lows) as it has been consolidating following the hit on a major target (0.46014) and  support level . Our TP remains 0.4000. XRPUSD will eventually break the intermediate line (red dotted) and make an even more aggressive Lower Low = 0.35277 on the 1D Channel Down as the 1W selling pressure is greater than previously (Highs/Lows = -0.0869).

After trying to bring the XRP back to life - they met with the sellers. I am waiting for the breakdown of the triangle down and working out the tired on big timeframes. However, when breaking the triangle up - buyers are waiting for problems at 0.49-0.495 and at the price level of 0.51.

The rate of Ripple was in a lateral movement yesterday.  
Priority of the day: neutral position on XRPUSD. 
We are out of the market today, because it's too late to sell Ripple, and the reversal for its purchase has not come yet. 
We stuck today to our forecast of a small increase in the Ripple rate to $ 0.50. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.47 to $ 0.50. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will drop from $ 0.47 to $ 0.42.

1530047126.0,Elliottwave-Forecast,XRP/USD 4 Hour Elliott Wave Analysis,"
Hello Traders, 

In this analysis, we will have a look at XRP/USD in the 4-hour chart. 

Down from 04/24/18 peak, Ripple is showing an incomplete 5 swings sequence to the downside. 

Ripple completed the cycle from 04/24/18 in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5428). The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii -1.36% )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052). The internals of red wave A unfolded in a 5 waves  Elliott Wave  impulse, where it ended black wave ((i)) at the low of 06/05/18 (0.6338). Up from there, black wave ((ii)) correction was complete at 06/07/18 peak (0.6862). Below from there, it ended black wave (( iii -1.36% )) at the low of 06/10/18 (0.5553) and the correction in black wave ((iv)) at the peak of 06/11/18 (0.6038). Below from there, it finished black wave ((v)) of red wave A at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5045). From that low, it ended red wave B correction at the peak of 06/15/18 (0.5684). 

As long as bounces fail below 0.70 peak, then XRP will be looking to trade lower toward equal legs area 0.28 – 0.18 before ending a 7 swings double three structure. Up from there, it will be looking to bounce higher in 3 waves at least.

1530021929.0,Exsilium,$XRP #Ripple - Near Term Bottom Sill In Play - Still Bullish,"
Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC 0.00%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO 0.00% , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term.

As long as bounces fail below 0.70 peak, then XRP will be looking to trade lower toward equal legs area 0.28 – 0.18 before ending a 7 swings double three structure. Up from there, it will be looking to bounce higher in 3 waves at least.

Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC -0.02%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO 0.00% , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term.

The rate of Ripple was in a lateral movement yesterday.  
Priority of the day: neutral position on XRPUSD. 
We are out of the market today, because it's too late to sell Ripple, and the reversal for its purchase has not come yet. 
We stuck today to our forecast of a small increase in the Ripple rate to $ 0.50. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.47 to $ 0.50. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will drop from $ 0.47 to $ 0.42.

Hello Traders, 

In this analysis, we will have a look at XRP/USD in the 4-hour chart. 

Down from 04/24/18 peak, Ripple is showing an incomplete 5 swings sequence to the downside. 

Ripple completed the cycle from 04/24/18 in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5428). The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii -1.04% )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052). The internals of red wave A unfolded in a 5 waves  Elliott Wave  impulse, where it ended black wave ((i)) at the low of 06/05/18 (0.6338). Up from there, black wave ((ii)) correction was complete at 06/07/18 peak (0.6862).

Hello Traders, 

In this analysis, we will have a look at XRP/USD in the 4-hour chart. 

Down from 04/24/18 peak, Ripple is showing an incomplete 5 swings sequence to the downside. 

Ripple completed the cycle from 04/24/18 in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5428). The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii -1.06% )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052). The internals of red wave A unfolded in a 5 waves  Elliott Wave  impulse, where it ended black wave ((i)) at the low of 06/05/18 (0.6338). Up from there, black wave ((ii)) correction was complete at 06/07/18 peak (0.6862). Below from there, it ended black wave (( iii -1.06% )) at the low of 06/10/18 (0.5553) and the correction in black wave ((iv)) at the peak of 06/11/18 (0.6038). Below from there, it finished black wave ((v)) of red wave A at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5045). From that low, it ended red wave B correction at the peak of 06/15/18 (0.5684). 

As long as bounces fail below 0.70 peak, then XRP will be looking to trade lower toward equal legs area 0.28 – 0.18 before ending a 7 swings double three structure. Up from there, it will be looking to bounce higher in 3 waves at least.

Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC 0.02%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO 0.00% , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term.

As expected, Ripple continued its calculated decline within the 1D Channel Down ( RSI  = 32.626, Highs/Lows = -0.0233, B/BP = -0.0848) as it broke the previous 4H  Rectangle . 4H is still neutral ( ADX ,  CCI , Highs/Lows) as it has been consolidating following the hit on a major target (0.46014) and  support level .

After trying to bring the XRP back to life - they met with the sellers. I am waiting for the breakdown of the triangle down and working out the tired on big timeframes. However, when breaking the triangle up - buyers are waiting for problems at 0.49-0.495 and at the price level of 0.51.

The rate of Ripple was in a lateral movement yesterday.  
Priority of the day: neutral position on XRPUSD. 
We are out of the market today, because it's too late to sell Ripple, and the reversal for its purchase has not come yet. 
We stuck today to our forecast of a small increase in the Ripple rate to $ 0.50. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.47 to $ 0.50. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will drop from $ 0.47 to $ 0.42. 
Alternative scenario: 
Our plans may be spoiled by another day of flat for the Ripple rate.

After trying to bring the XRP back to life - they met with the sellers. I am waiting for the breakdown of the triangle down and working out the tired on big timeframes. However, when breaking the triangle up - buyers are waiting for problems at 0.49-0.495 and at the price level of 0.51.

The rate of Ripple was in a lateral movement yesterday.  
Priority of the day: neutral position on XRPUSD. 
We are out of the market today, because it's too late to sell Ripple, and the reversal for its purchase has not come yet. 
We stuck today to our forecast of a small increase in the Ripple rate to $ 0.50. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The rate of XRPUSD will rise from $ 0.47 to $ 0.50. 
2. The rate of XRPUSD will drop from $ 0.47 to $ 0.42. 
Alternative scenario: 
Our plans may be spoiled by another day of flat for the Ripple rate.

1530047126.0,Elliottwave-Forecast,XRP/USD 4 Hour Elliott Wave Analysis,"
Hello Traders, 

In this analysis, we will have a look at XRP/USD in the 4-hour chart. 

Down from 04/24/18 peak, Ripple is showing an incomplete 5 swings sequence to the downside. 

Ripple completed the cycle from 04/24/18 in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5428). The internals of blue wave (W) unfolded as an  Elliott Wave Zig-Zag  structure where it ended cycle from 04/24/18 peak at the low of 04/26/18 (0.7598) in red wave A. Up from that low it finished the correction in red wave B at the peak of 05/04/18 (0.9238). Below from there, it ended internal black wave ((i)) at the low of 05/12/18 (0.6336). Up from there, it completed the correction in black wave ((ii)) at the peak of 05/14/18 (0.7483). Below from that peak, black wave (( iii -0.89% )) completed at the low of 05/23/18 (0.5735) and it ended black wave ((iv)) correction at the peak of 05/24/18 (0.6390). Below from there, it completed black wave ((v)) of red wave C in blue wave (W) at the low of 05/29/18 (0.5466).  

Up from there, it ended blue wave (X) correction at the peak of 06/04/18 (0.7035). 

Below from 06/04/18 peak, it completed red wave A as a part of an  Elliott Wave Zigzag  structure at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5052). The internals of red wave A unfolded in a 5 waves  Elliott Wave  impulse, where it ended black wave ((i)) at the low of 06/05/18 (0.6338). Up from there, black wave ((ii)) correction was complete at 06/07/18 peak (0.6862). Below from there, it ended black wave (( iii -0.89% )) at the low of 06/10/18 (0.5553) and the correction in black wave ((iv)) at the peak of 06/11/18 (0.6038). Below from there, it finished black wave ((v)) of red wave A at the low of 06/13/18 (0.5045). From that low, it ended red wave B correction at the peak of 06/15/18 (0.5684). 

As long as bounces fail below 0.70 peak, then XRP will be looking to trade lower toward equal legs area 0.28 – 0.18 before ending a 7 swings double three structure. Up from there, it will be looking to bounce higher in 3 waves at least.

1530021929.0,Exsilium,$XRP #Ripple - Near Term Bottom Sill In Play - Still Bullish,"
Im getting a lot of push from other chart analyzers that were going lower, that my current analysis is silly. 

Elliot Wave  theory says that every impulse wave structure is followed by a corrective wave structure. While there are a very large number of potential correction wave formations, the simplest of those is the  ABC  correction wave. At this point in time we havent seen a completed  ABC , let alone any of the more complex correction wave formations.  

At the most we could be seeing an AB of an  ABC  wave in the Minor degree (green). A potential Flat  ABC  would mean at least another test of 0.496. Flat  ABC  are not the norm though and we should see a push above 0.496 to complete the standard  ABC  formation. 

Assuming for the moment that the current minor wave is wave B, it could extend down to retest the bottom, below that would invalidate any correction wave count. 

If this is the reversal point as I suspect (really hope  BTC 0.02%  gets its act together),  ABC  would actually be 123 of a 5 count.  

Heres the tricky part... all of that is when we consider the Minor wave structure. The recent bottom also completed the Intermediate wave structure, which means there should be an Intermediate correction wave, which would require significantly higher moves. The 0.382 for the Intermediate degree would be 0.54. 

With the very potential  double bottom  coinciding with the Monthly S1 and the current wave structures, I simply do not see us making a new low until we at least hit 0.54. 

A break above 0.60 would confirm the reversal  IMHO 0.00% , while a break of 0.50 would confirm the near term. 

=========== 

As always, this is my personal observation and analysis of the market and is not intended to be trading advice.

As expected, Ripple continued its calculated decline within the 1D Channel Down ( RSI  = 32.626, Highs/Lows = -0.0233, B/BP = -0.0848) as it broke the previous 4H  Rectangle . 4H is still neutral ( ADX ,  CCI , Highs/Lows) as it has been consolidating following the hit on a major target (0.46014) and  support level . Our TP remains 0.4000. XRPUSD will eventually break the intermediate line (red dotted) and make an even more aggressive Lower Low = 0.35277 on the 1D Channel Down as the 1W selling pressure is greater than previously (Highs/Lows = -0.0869).

XRP has won 0.01% in the last 24H recovering the losses of the weekend and now it's trading around $ 0.4780 after breaking the major support at $0.5000 in this 1H chart. The pair traded yesterday in a monthly low at $0.4400 but the buyers appeared to rescue the price and send it back over the central  pivot point . Now the price is bouncing repeatedly in the descending  bearish  line and under the EMA-100. A breakout of this line could be an interesting opportunity for a long trade.
