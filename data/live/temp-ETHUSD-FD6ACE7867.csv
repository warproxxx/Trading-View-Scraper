1530861827.0,VARZAR_INVESTMENT,Trading plan: ETHUSD (Ethereum),"
The  Ethereum -2.41%  rate finishes its correction and prepares to drop. 
Priority of the day: decrease of the  ETHUSD -2.41%  rate with a target of $ 420. 
We waited a long time for the end of the  Ethereum -2.41%  price rollback to continue to work on a downtrend. Our plans include the search for an entry point for the sale of  Ethereum -2.41%  near the levels: $ 480, $ 470. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD -2.41%  rate will drop from $ 470 to $ 420. 
2. The  ETHUSD -2.41%  rate will remain in flat one more day. 
An alternative scenario: 
For the broad picture of the  Ethereum -2.41%  sales, we need movement upwards, to $ 490, $ 500. Therefore, a small momentum of  Ethereum -2.41%  rate is possible, with a subsequent drop to $ 420, $ 400.
