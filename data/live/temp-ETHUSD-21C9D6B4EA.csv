Despite the surge of ETH/USD from $408 on 28 June with current price at $454.50 (08:42 UTC), we still see a possible slide to $362.49 where it's now finding support. Breaking that may push the price lower to $278, or even regrettably to $178. On the positive side, we still expect a reversal at the $362  support level  which will healthy for the ecosystem and prevent a panic selloff.
