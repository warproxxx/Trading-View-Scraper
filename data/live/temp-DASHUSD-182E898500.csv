1530214202.0,BethanyJoy,DASH warming up its engines,"
Daily log chart. 

Many factors are leading me to believe DASH has found a bottom. 
-Flat  volume  after  volume  dieoff 
-Bullish divergences on  MACD  and  RSI 
-Current price action within a major historical  support/resistance  zone. 
-BTC also showing signs of near-bottoming 

We're moving downward in a channel (yellow dashed lines) and downward in a descending  wedge  (purple). 

Watch .236 retrace of move to previous  ATH 0.67%  for target prices, taking profit/moving up stop loss at windows along the way dependent on your strategy. 

The bottom may take a while. If you're patient, starting to accumulate here is not a bad choice. The profit potential on DASH is considerable, especially if you're interested in a long-term trade. 

Measure twice, cut once. 
May all of life's treasures be yours.
